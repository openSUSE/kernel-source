Subject: printk: Make sure to wake up printk kthread from irq work for pending output
Patch-mainline: No, still discussed upstream
References: bnc#744692, bnc#789311, bsc#1174146

The variable printk_kthread_need_flush_console informs
printk_kthread about a pending job. We need to set it also
when the console handling is deferred from the irq_work
that is triggered from printk_deferred().

Otherwise, printk_kthread might miss the new message
when it appears after console_unlock() finishes and
the wake_up_process() is called before the kthread calls
schedule().
