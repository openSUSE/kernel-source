+Developing ACPI for Linux - July 13, 2007
+------------------------------------------
+Len Brown <lenb@kernel.org> (Intel Open Source Technology Center)
+
+This is how you can be most effective improving Linux ACPI support.
+
+Latest version of this file
+---------------------------
+http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/patches/README.ACPI
+
+Linux/ACPI home page
+--------------------
+http://acpi.sourceforge.net/
+
+Mailing Lists
+-------------
+Inventory of lists: http://acpi.sourceforge.net/mailinglists.html
+
+The main list is linux-acpi@vger.kernel.org.
+Subscribe here: http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html#linux-acpi
+Note this list server has a 100KB message limit size.
+If you need to post something big, attaching it to a bugzilla entry
+(below) is usually the way to go.
+
+Which e-mail address to use?
+----------------------------
+For issues, discussion, RFC's, debugging etc:
+To: linux-acpi@vger.kernel.org
+
+To request an ACPI patch be applied to Linux:
+To: lenb@kernel.org
+Cc: linux-acpi@vger.kernel.org
+
+Feedback to (only) Intel on Intel's ACPICA,
+or ACPI-related issues with NDA pre-production systems:
+To: acpi@linux.intel.com
+
+Len Brown is on both of these lists, and he also sees traffic to
+LKML, cpufreq, pci, and ia64 lists when the word ACPI appears in it.
+
+Note that Len signs-off using "len.brown@intel.com" to make it clear
+that he is employed by Intel.  While that address is functional,
+lenb@kernel.org is preferred for all public Linux work.
+
+asus_acpi or asus-laptop specific e-mail:
+to: acpi4asus-user@lists.sourceforge.net
+
+ibm_acpi specific e-mail:
+ibm-acpi-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
+
+Bugzilla
+--------
+The Linux/ACPI community makes active use of bugzilla.
+http://bugzilla.kernel.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=ACPI
+Note that this database is for kernel.org kernels only.
+
+If an issue is specific to a distribution, it should
+be filed in their database.  If a sighting appears in both,
+please cross reference it using a complete URL.
+
+In both cases, please cc: acpi-bugzilla@lists.sourceforge.net
+on the bug report.  You can subscribe to this list to see
+all ACPI bugzilla updates:
+https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/acpi-bugzilla
+Note that this list is intended for bugzilla machine-generated
+messages only.
+
+If the distribution bug report is private due to being
+on pre-production hardware and you want Intel's ACPI team
+to know about it, then cc: acpi@linux.intel.com
+
+Sometimes you'll see check-in comments including reference
+to small bugzilla numbers, eg. (BZ 123), these refer to a
+bugzilla database inside Intel where ACPICA issues
+are tracked that don't apply directly to the Linux kernel
+and thus would not fit within the charter of bugzilla.kernel.org.
+
+While discussion-oriented issues are best dealt with
+on the list, bugzilla has two useful properties:
+
+1. you can attach a whole bunch of stuff there
+   without irritating everybody on the list --
+   including items > 100KB.
+2. bugzilla never forgets -- so your issue
+   will not get lost in the shuffle of e-mail overload.
+
+Sometimes it works well to file the supporting debug output
+for your issue in bugzilla and then refer to it
+on the linux-acpi@vger.kernel.org list.
+
+Please be sure to answer these questions when you submit
+the bug, so they don't have to be asked later:
+
+0. Exactly what kernel version does this bug appear in?
+
+1. Does it still appear in the latest version?
+
+2. Is this a new problem (a regression) or has this problem
+   always existed in every version of Linux tested?
+
+3. If a regression, what is the latest version of the
+   kernel.org kernel where it does not happen?
+
+   If you have a git tree, can you isolate the regression
+   to a particular commit using git-bisect?
+
+4. For the latest working, and for the failing kernel
+   please _attach_ (do not paste) the complete output
+   from dmesg -s64000 or serial console capture with "debug"
+   on cmdline, if possible.
+
+5. If it is an interrupt-related problem, please paste
+   a copy of /proc/interrupts showing both the success
+   and failure case, if possible.  Also include the full
+   output from lspci -vv.
+
+6. Please attach the complete, unprocessed output from acpidump.
+   acpidump is available in /usr/sbin, or in the latest PMtools here:
+   http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/utils/
+   Note that very old versions of this tool were called "acpidmp",
+   and if that is on hand and it works, then that is okay too.
+
+7. If this turns out to be a platform-specific issue where we may
+   have to blacklist the machine to enable a workaround, please
+   include the output from dmidecode.
+
+Linux/ACPI Patch Flow
+---------------------
+1. The community develops, reviews, and tests patches
+
+2. Len Brown, the Linux/ACPI Maintainer, checks them into
+   the "acpi-test" tree (below)
+ 
+3. Andrew Morton incorporates acpi-test into mm as git-acpi.patch
+ 
+4. Len moves mature patches from acpi-test to a release branch,
+   and requests Linus Torvalds pull them into the upstream kernel.
+
+5. Distributors re-base their products onto Linus' kernel
+
+Linux Release Cycle
+-------------------
+Len aims to integrate all ACPI patches for each release
+during the 1st week of Linus' 2-week "integration window".
+This refers to period between when Linus releases 2.6.X
+and 2.6.X+1-rc1.  For patches to go upstream in this window,
+they should have already been pushed into Len's linux-acpi
+tree and appeared in several of Andrew's -mm releases.
+
+Patches that miss this window must wait 6 weeks for the
+next window to open up.  The period after X+1-rc1
+and X+1 release is intended for fixing any regressions, and
+for low-risk critical bug fixes.
+
+Sending Patches
+---------------
+Read and follow Documentation/SubmittingPatches
+
+Proposed patches to the Linux/ACPI kernel sub-system should be
+e-mailed to linux-acpi@vger.kernel.org
+for review, comment, and testing by the community.
+Many patches also are cc'd to linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org.
+If the patch touches code outside drivers/acpi,
+including LKML is mandatory.
+
+It is important to describe your expectations of the patch
+in the e-mail.  If it is an experiment, or a debug patch,
+please say so.  If you think it is well tested, broadly reviewed
+and ready to integrate into the upstream kernel, say that
+using the words "please apply", adding lenb@kernel.org the
+"to: list" to make sure he sees your request.
+
+Note that Len prefers patches in plain text, but if you need
+to use attachments to deal with your mail client, that is okay too.
+
+Len also takes patches directly from bugzilla entries.
+Indeed, he tries to give priority to bugzilla fixes
+because bugzilla does such a good job remembering the
+details of the issue, and the people involved have taken
+the trouble to carefully enter the data in bugzilla.
+
+If you send a patch as an attachment, or attach it to bugzilla,
+it is helpful if you format the patch according to SubmittingPatches,
+ie. include a From:, Subject: and check-in comments before the patch body.
+
+ACPICA
+------
+Len also integrates updates from ACPICA, the "ACPI
+Component Architecture" -- the core interpreter that Intel
+develops for the benefit of all ACPI operating systems.
+(okay, all but Windows -- MS uses their own interpreter)
+Intel publishes ACPICA under a dual source license so that
+FreeBSD etc. can use it w/o GPL tainting.  Linux gets huge
+benefits from sharing this core, and so preventing divergence
+between Linux and the shared ACPICA code is why Len hates
+to accept GPL patches to some files.  Note that the ACPICA
+files are the ones in the sub-directories under drivers/acpi/*
+plus a bunch of include/acpi/ headers.  All the other kernel files
+in drivers/acpi/* and elsewhere are straight GPL -- as indicated
+in their header copyright comments.
+
+git
+---
+Len follows Tony Luck's method of using GIT branches, documented in
+git/Documentation/howto/using-topic-branches.txt
+
+The latest patches intended for Linus are here:
+git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/lenb/linux-acpi-2.6.git release
+
+The latest patches intended for community testing are here:
+git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/lenb/linux-acpi-2.6.git test
+
+Andrew Morton periodically pulls the test branch and creates
+a consolidated git-acpi.patch and applies it to his mm release.
+
+git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/lenb/linux-acpi-2.6.git acpica
+Is a topic-specific branch containing the latest ACPICA interpreter.
+It will get pulled into the test branch above when ready.
+There may be other topic-specific branches from time to time.
+
+Fetching code via git is the easiest way to stay up to date,
+so get git and get going:
+
+git pull git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/lenb/linux-acpi-2.6.git test
+
+Git startup instructions: http://linux.yyz.us/git-howto.html
+
+Beware that Len takes the liberty of occasionally re-writing the history
+of the test branch.  So you may have conflicts if you re-pull
+into an "untouched" repo.  Sorry about that.  This is because
+1. Andrew doesn't care about history, he makes it into 1 patch anyway.
+2. Linux wants "clean history"
+3. Len wants Linus to get exactly what was tested, merges and all.
+
+So beware if you base a git tree on the acpi test branch.
+If you do, it means Len will unlikely be able to pull your tree.
+It is generally better to base your work off of Linus' tree, when possible.
+Len will generally have to apply your work vs. Linus' tree anyway.
+
+patches
+-------
+ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/patches/release
+
+includes patches from the Linux/ACPI git release branch.
+Len publishes these when he sends a pull request to Linus.
+If Linus doesn't pull for a while, this patch tells you what
+is in the queue.  As soon as Linus pulls, however, this patch
+becomes a duplicate of what is in Linus' tree and will thus
+no longer apply.
+
+The patches are named like so:
+acpi-release-20050902-2.6.15-rc5.diff.gz
+was created on the "release" branch,
+some time after 2.6.15-rc5,
+and includes ACPICA up through 20050902.
+
+ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/patches/test
+
+includes patches from the Linux/ACPI test branch,
+as well as other topic branches such as acpica:
+acpi-test-20050916-2.6.15-rc5.diff.gz
+acpi-acpica-20051202-2.6.15-rc5.diff.gz
+
+Len rarely publishes individual test patches here, since they can
+now be pulled from the GUI using gitweb:
+http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/lenb/linux-acpi-2.6.git
+
+patch signing
+-------------
+files on ftp.kernel.org compressed and signed per
+http://www.kernel.org/signature.html
+
+If you'd like to verify the signature, import key by:
+gpg --keyserver wwwkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys 0x517D0F0E
+
+verify integrity by:
+gpg --verify <sigfile> <signed-file>
+
+you can skip <signed-file> if it is in the same directory as <sigfile>.
+
+applying patches
+----------------
+Both Test and Release patches have a header at the top of the patch
+including the commit comments to describe what is included
+in the patch.  Note you can test if a patch will apply cleanly
+before you apply it for real:
+
+$ cd my-src/linux/
+To test
+$ patch --dry-run -Np1 < acpi.patch
+For real:
+$ patch -Np1 < acpi.patch
+
+Where do I get acpidump for capturing my systems ACPI tables?
+-------------------------------------------------------------
+Previously spelled acpidmp -- it is included in most distros.
+If not, you can get the latest version from the latest
+pmtools package here:
+
+http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/utils/
+See the README in the package for how to use it.
+
+Where do I get iasl for dis-assembling and compiling tables?
+------------------------------------------------------------
+http://www.intel.com/technology/iapc/acpi/downloads.htm
+
+Note that "iasl -d" can now not only dis-assemble a DSDT
+and SSDT, but also most other ACPI table images.
+
+How to Build a custom DSDT into the kernel
+------------------------------------------
+Get original DSDT:
+# cp /proc/acpi/dsdt DSDT
+or
+# acpidump > acpidump.out
+$ acpixtract DSDT acpidump > DSDT
+
+Disassemble it
+$ iasl -d DSDT
+Make your changes:
+$ vi DSDT.dsl
+Build it:
+$ iasl -tc DSDT.dsl
+Put it where the kernel build can include it:
+$ cp DSDT.hex $SRC/include/
+
+Add this to the kernel .config:
+
+CONFIG_STANDALONE=n
+CONFIG_ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT=y
+CONFIG_ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT_FILE="DSDT.hex"
+
+Make the kernel and off you go!
+You should see in dmesg:
+Table [DSDT] replaced by host OS
+
+Note that with
+CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG=y
+then ASL stores to the special object "Debug" will
+come out in the dmesg.  eg
+
+Store("hello world!", Debug)
+Store(Local0, Debug)
+
+[ACPI Debug]  String: [0x0C] "hello world!"
+[ACPI Debug]  Integer: 0x00000042
+
+As of linux-2.6.23, "acpi_no_auto_ssdt" if available
+to prevent Linux from automatically loading all
+the SSDTs listed in the RSDT/XSDT.  So with this option,
+the SSDTs can be included in the DSDT override
+to effectively create a DSDT+SSDT override.
+
+ACPI: Looking for DSDT ... not found!
+-------------------------------------
+This is a message from a patch that SuSE and Ubuntu
+integrate into their distributions so that you can
+over-ride the DSDT without re-compiling the kernel.
+
+If you don't like the message, contact your distributor.
+
+Len will not apply that patch upstream because:
+1. Modified firmware has no place on supported systems.
+2. If Windows can handle un-modified firmware, Linux should too.
+3. Linux distributors can not support systems running modified firmware.
+4. If somebody is unable to re-build the kernel,
+   then they have no business running modified platform firmware.
+
+Yes, there is at least one person who wants to run
+the same kernel on multiple machines all running
+different modified DSDTs -- they can run SuSE.
+
+Yes, SuSE can use this technique to debug issues
+without requiring the customer to re-build the kernel.
+However, neither case justifies this capability upstream.

+How to debug ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) Problems
+=======================================================================
+
+Thomas Renninger <trenn@suse.de>, 2007
+Copyright (C) 2007 SUSE Linux GmbH
+
+
+1. Introduction
+---------------
+
+1.1. General Info
+- - - - - - - -
+
+Please refer to the latest ACPI spec for general ACPI information:
+http://www.acpi.info/spec.htm
+
+
+ACPI is required by most recent x86, x86_64 and IA64 architecture based
+machines.
+
+In general ACPI tables provide information from the BIOS to the OS.
+There are ACPI tables (DSDT and SSDTs), written in the ACPI Source
+Language (ASL) which include byte code (similar to Java byte code) that gets
+interpreted by the OS. The kernel makes use of BIOS functions declared and
+described there by interpreting them to setup and access different hardware.
+
+There exist two compilers/interpreters for ASL code, one from Microsoft and
+one from Intel. The Intel code has an Open Source license. The software package
+is called ACPICA. It includes the code for disassembling DSDT tables,
+(re-)compiling them, parsing several ACPI tables and interpreting ACPI Machine
+Language (AML, the compiled ASL..). The code is used to provide several
+userspace tools, but large parts are also contributed to the linux kernel and
+other OSs.
+drivers/acpi/*.c currently is Linux code implementing most parts of the ACPI
+spec, everything in the directories below, gets synchronized with the ACPICA
+Intel package.
+
+
+1.2. Useful Userspace Tools for Table Playing
+- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
+
+The ACPI tables of your system can be extracted with the acpidump tool in the
+latest pmutils package from here:
+ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/utils
+
+acpixtract, iasl, acpiexec can be found in the ACPICA sources:
+http://developer.intel.com/technology/iapc/acpi/downloads.htm
+
+You can now:
+acpidump >acpidump       # cp your ACPI tables from memory to disk
+acpixtract -a acpidump   # extract them into raw, single tables
+iasl -d TABLE.dat        # disassemble/parse a specific table
+iasl -sa DSDT.dsl        # e.g. recompile a modified, disassembled DSDT for
+                           initramfs inclusion (see later)
+acpiexec DSDT.dat        # parse, interpret and load a DSDT in userspace
+
+The latter can sometimes be very useful to debug buggy DSDTs in userspace.
+It provides a debug shell which e.g. offers execution of specific ACPI
+functions, increase of debug output and more.
+
+
+2. Overriding DSDT
+------------------
+
+The DSDT (there is a patch also for SSDTs) can be overridden by the user.
+The tables get copied to RAM when booting and the kernel can override them with
+alternative tables at early boot time.
+
+Historically people used to override their DSDT to workaround BIOS or even
+kernel bugs. This is a bad idea, the override functionality is for short
+term workarounds and mainly for debugging! Please always report such bugs to
+bugzilla.kernel.org or post to linux-acpi@vger.kernel.org if unsure.
+
+There are two possibilities to override the DSDT:
+
+  - via CONFIG_ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT (and _FILE) compile option(s)
+  - via adding a customized DSDT into initramfs
+
+The second approach does not need kernel recompilation and some distributions
+provide the patch, which is not included in mainline, in their kernels.
+
+The patch and more information can be found here (many thanks to Markus
+Gaugusch and Eric Piel):
+http://gaugusch.at/kernel.shtml
+
+
+3. Problem Analysis and Solving
+-------------------------------
+
+3.1. I see Warnings or Errors when disassembling or compiling my DSDT
+- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
+
+Some might be sever ACPICA or BIOS bugs, some might just be incompatibilities
+with the Microsoft compiler. We want to fix both, therefore a bug should be
+filed at bugzilla.kernel.org
+In general you should watch your system, if you don't miss any functionality
+there is no reason to panic (e.g. modify the DSDT and override your original
+one, you really should not do that if you do not see any big advantage and even
+then, better try to get a real fix or at least a kernel workaround like a
+boot or module parameter).
+
+You should be able to debug this with userspace tools (See:
+"1.2. Useful Userspace Tools for Table Playing")
+
+
+3.2. Hardware accessed by ACPI is not working correctly - Using ACPI_DEBUG
+- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
+
+If you suspect the bug to be in a module in drivers/acpi/*.c code, you may be
+able to find or narrow down the culprit simply by adding printk()'s.
+
+For more complicated bugs you should make use of the ACPI_DEBUG=y facility.
+This allows you to fine grain enable specific output in the ACPI interpreter.
+
+
+   3.2.1 Using ACPI_DEBUG Boot Parameters acpi.debug_level and acpi.debug_layer
+
+         Note: In kernel versions before 2.6.22 the boot parameters were:
+	       acpi_dbg_level and acpi_dbg_layer
+
+         ACPI can produce tons of debug output if these debug masks are
+         switched to full on.
+	 include/acpi/acoutput.h shows which flags can be enabled for level and
+         layer (cat /proc/acpi/debug_{level,layer} also shows you the flags,
+	 but that interface will move to sysfs, not sure whether there still
+	 will be such a help).
+
+         Therefore, switch on debug flags carefully. You also might want to
+	 increase the kernel ring buffer by passing:
+	 log_buf_len=XY in bytes and later use dmesg -s XY to get more than
+	 16k kernel log output.
+	 Instead of serial console logging you might want to use the netconsole
+	 interface (Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt) to send syslog
+	 messages over network or firewire to send syslog messages over
+	 firewire.
+	 The latter might be the only way to debug early hangs on laptops
+	 without a serial device anyway.
+
+   3.2.2 Using ACPI_DEBUG Boot Parameters via /sysfs and /proc
+
+	 The same as 3.2.1., you can also pass the parameters at runtime e.g.
+	 via:
+	 echo 0x1F >/sys/module/acpi/parameters/debug_{level,layer}
+
+	 Be aware that this interface exists since 2.6.22. In older kernels
+	 it is /proc/acpi/debug_{level,layer}, which worked in the same way.
+
+	 Wrapping such statements around loading and unloading a bug affected
+	 ACPI module might give you the possibility to increase debug_level,
+	 but still only give you a manageable amount of debug output.
+
+   3.2.3 Using ACPI_DEBUG ASL debug object
+
+	 You can also add a kind of printk to DSDT code(see 2. Overriding DSDT)
+	 Store (XY, debug), will print the value of the ACPI XY variable into
+	 syslog. Be aware that you need to have the
+	 #define ACPI_LV_DEBUG_OBJECT        0x00000008
+	 value defined in the debug_level mask to see any output.
+	 This may only be useful if you get too much output with 3.2.[12] and
+	 you think it is convenient to debug a very specific part of the ACPI
+	 code.
+
+   3.2.4 Using ACPI_DEBUG acpi_dbg_layer and acpi_dbg_level kernel variables
+
+	 Similar, but more powerful than 3.2.3 is to modify the global kernel
+	 variables for level and layer conditionally in the kernel code for
+	 your needs.
+	 E.g.
+	 acpi_debug_level=0xFFFFFFFF /* increase debug output to max */
+	 status = acpi_ut_evaluate_object(...) /* by kernel invoked ACPI method
+						  that should get debugged with
+						  very high debug output*/
+	 acpi_debug_level=0x3        /* lower debug output again */
