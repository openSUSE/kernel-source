Subject: [PATCH] sched: migrate_enable: Busy loop until the migration
 request is completed
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/wagi/linux-stable-rt.git
Git-commit: d33fa77a70f9596db34bb2c07670d3bcf3aa0ca7
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
References: SLE Realtime Extension

If user task changes the CPU affinity mask of a running task it will
dispatch migration request if the current CPU is no longer allowed. This
might happen shortly before a task enters a migrate_disable() section.
Upon leaving the migrate_disable() section, the task will notice that
the current CPU is no longer allowed and will will dispatch its own
migration request to move it off the current CPU.
While invoking __schedule() the first migration request will be
processed and the task returns on the "new" CPU with "arg.done = 0". Its
own migration request will be processed shortly after and will result in
memory corruption if the stack memory, designed for request, was used
otherwise in the meantime.

Spin until the migration request has been processed if it was accepted.
