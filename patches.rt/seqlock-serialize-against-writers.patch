seqlock: serialize against writers

There are currently several problems in -rt w.r.t. seqlock objects. RT
moves mainline seqlock_t to "raw_seqlock_t", and creates a new seqlock_t
object that is fully preemptible.  Being preemptible is a great step
towards deterministic behavior, but there are a few areas that need
additional measures to protect new vulnerabilities created by the
preemptible code. For the purposes of demonstration, consider three tasks
of different priority: A, B, and C.  A is the logically highest, and C is
the lowest.  A is trying to acquire a seqlock read critical section, while
C is involved in write locks.

Problem 1) If A spins in seqbegin due to writer contention retries, it may
prevent C from running even if C currently holds the write lock.  This
is a deadlock.

Problem 2) B may preempt C, preventing it from releasing the write
critical section.  In this case, A becomes inverted behind B.

Problem 3) Lower priority tasks such as C may continually acquire the write
section which subsequently causes A to continually retry and thus fail to
make forward progress.  Since C is lower priority it ideally should not
cause delays in A. E.g. C should block if A is in a read-lock and C is <= A.

This patch addresses Problems 1 & 2, and leaves 3 for a later time.

This patch changes the internal seqlock_t implementation to substitute
a rwlock for the basic spinlock previously used, and forces the readers
to serialize with the writers under contention.  Blocking on the read_lock
simultaneously sleeps A (preventing problem 1), while boosting C to A's
priority (preventing problem 2).  Non reader-to-writer contended
acquisitions, which are the predominant mode, remain free of atomic
operations.  Therefore the fast path should not be perturbed by this
change.

This fixes a real-world deadlock discovered under testing where all
high priority readers were hogging the cpus and preventing a writer
from releasing the lock (i.e. problem 1).
