Subject: [HACK] convert i_alloc_sem for direct_io.c craziness!


Hopefully I will get some attention from those that are responsible for
fs/direct_io.c

Ingo and Thomas,

This patch converts the i_alloc_sem into a compat_rw_semaphore for the -rt
patch.  Seems that the code in fs/direct_io.c does some nasty logic with
the i_alloc_sem.  For DIO_LOCKING, I'm assuming that the i_alloc_sem is
used as a reference counter for pending requests. When the request is
made, the down_read is performed. When the request is handled by the block
softirq, then that softirq does an up on the request. So the owner is not
the same between down and up. When all requests are handled, the semaphore
counter should be zero. This keeps away any write access while requests
are pending.

Now this may all be well and dandy for vanilla Linux, but it breaks
miserbly when converted to -rt.

1) In RT rw_semaphores must be up'd by the same thread that down's it.

2) We can't do PI on the correct processes.

This patch converts (for now) the i_alloc_sem into a compat_rw_semaphore
to give back the old features to the sem. This fixes deadlocks that we've
been having WRT direct_io.  But unfortunately, it now opens up
unbonded priority inversion with this semaphore.  But really, those that
can be affected by this, shouldn't be doing disk IO anyway.

The real fix would be to get rid of the read semaphore trickery in
direct_io.c.
