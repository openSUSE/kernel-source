The seqlock protocol is broken in -rt for raw_seqlock_t objects.  This
manifested in my 2.6.26-rt1 kernel as a 500ms (yes, millisecond) spike
which was traced out with ftrace/preemptirqsoff to be originating in
the HRT (hrtimer_interrupt, to be precise).  It would occasionally
spin processing the same CLOCK_MONOTONIC timer (the scheduler-tick)
in a tight loop with interrupts disabled.  Investigating, it turned out
that the time-basis recorded for "now" early in the interrupt was
momentarily moved 500ms in the future.  This caused all timers with
correct expiration times to appear to have expired a long time ago.
Even rescheduling the timer via hrtimer_forward ultimately placed the
timer in an "expired" state since the "now" basis was in the future.

So I began investigating how this time-basis (derived from ktime_get())
could have done this.  I observed that ktime_get() readers were able to
successfully read a time value even while another core held a
write-lock on the xtime_lock.  Therefore the fundamental issue was
that ktime_get was able to return transitional states of the
xtime/clocksource infrastructure, which is clearly not intended.

I root caused the issue to the raw_seqlock_t implementation.  It was
missing support for retrying a reader if it finds a write-pending
flag.  Investigating further, I think I can speculate why.

Back in April, Ingo and Thomas checked in a fix to mainline for seqlocks,
referenced here:

	commit 88a411c07b6fedcfc97b8dc51ae18540bd2beda0

	seqlock: livelock fix

	Thomas Gleixner debugged a particularly ugly seqlock related livelock:
	do not process the seq-read section if we know it beforehand that the
	test at the end of the section will fail ...

Of course, mainline only has seqlock_t.  In -rt, we have both seqlock_t
and raw_seqlock_t.  It would appear that the merge-resolution for
commit 88a411c07b6 to the -rt branch inadvertently applied one hunk
of the fix to seqlock_t, and the other to raw_seqlock_t.  The normal
seqlocks now have two checks for retry, while the raw_seqlocks have none.
This lack of a check is what causes the protocol failure, which ultimately
caused the bad clock info and a latency spike.

This patch corrects the above condition by applying the conceptual change
from 88a411c07b6 to both seqlock_t and raw_seqlock_t equally.  The observed
problems with the HRT spike are confirmed to no longer be reproducible as
as result.
