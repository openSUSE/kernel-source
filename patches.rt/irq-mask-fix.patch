Subject: genirq: fix simple and fasteoi irq handlers
From: Jarek Poplawski <jarkao2@o2.pl>

After the "genirq: do not mask interrupts by default" patch interrupts
should be disabled not immediately upon request, but after they happen.
But, handle_simple_irq() and handle_fasteoi_irq() can skip this once or
more if an irq is just serviced (IRQ_INPROGRESS), possibly disrupting a
driver's work.

The main reason of problems here, pointing the broken patch and making
the first patch which can fix this was done by Marcin Slusarz.
Additional test patches of Thomas Gleixner and Ingo Molnar tested by
Marcin Slusarz helped to narrow possible reasons even more. Thanks.

PS: this patch fixes only one evident error here, but there could be
more places affected by above-mentioned change in irq handling.

PS 2:
After rethinking, IMHO, there are two most probable scenarios here:

1. After hw resend there could be a conflict between retriggered
edge type irq and the next level type one: e.g. if this level type
irq (io_apic is enabled then) is triggered while retriggered irq is
serviced (IRQ_INPROGRESS) there is goto out with eoi, and probably
the next such levels are triggered and looping, so probably kind of
flood in io_apic until this retriggered edge service has ended. 
2. There is something wrong with ioapic_retrigger_irq (less probable
because this should be probably seen with 'normal' edge retriggers,
but on the other hand, they could be less common).

So, if there is #1, this fixed patch should work.

But, since level types don't need this retriggers too much I think
this "don't mask interrupts by default" idea should be rethinked:
is there enough gain to risk such hard to diagnose errors?
  
So, IMHO, there should be at least possibility to turn this off for
level types in config (it should be a visible option, so people could
find & try this before writing for help or changing a network card).
