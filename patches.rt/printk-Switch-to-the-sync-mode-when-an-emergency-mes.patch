Subject: [PATCH] printk: Switch to the sync mode when an emergency message is
 printed
Patch-mainline: No, still being discussed upstream
References: bsc#1034995, bsc#1174146

The fix for bsc#995541 forced printk sync mode in suspend_console().
It was supposed to fix two problems:

  + Avoid calling wake_up_process() during suspend. It caused printk()
    recursion when the timekeeping was already disabled.

  + Help to actually see the messages during the suspend when the
    printk_kthread is not longer scheduled.

It solved the problem with the suspend but it does not work is some
other important situations, for example, kexec, shutdown. suspend_console()
is not called there. Note that we have disabled CONFIG_KEXEC_JUMP in
SLE12 kernels.

This patch switches to the sync mode when a message with LOGLEVEL_EMERG
is printed. It handles most of the interesting situations, including
kexec and shutdown.
