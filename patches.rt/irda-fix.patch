Subject: Linux-RT 2.6.25.4-RT
From: http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/

This was found around the 2.6.10 timeframe when testing with the -rt patch
and I believe is still is an issue. irttp_dup() does a memcpy() of the tsap_cb 
structure causing the spinlock protecting various fields in the structure to be 
duped.  This works OK in the non-RT case but in the RT case we end up with two 
mutexes pointing to the same wait_list and leading to an OOPS. Fix is to simply
initialize the spinlock after the memcpy().
