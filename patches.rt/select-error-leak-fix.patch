As it is currently written, sys_select checks its return code to convert
ERESTARTNOHAND to EINTR.  However, the check is within an if (tvp) clause, and
so if select is called from userspace with a NULL timeval, then it is possible
for the ERESTARTNOHAND errno to leak into userspace, which is incorrect.  This
patch moves that check outside of the conditional, and prevents the errno leak.

Thanks & Regards
Neil
