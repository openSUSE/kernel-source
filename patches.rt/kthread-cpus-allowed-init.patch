Hi Ingo, Steve,
  I sent this patch a few weeks ago along with the migration_disable
series.  I think the controversy with the migration_disable feature
may have resulted in this fix being overlooked.  This patch is against
-rt, but the bug theoretically affects both -rt and sched-devel/mainline.
I can also whip up a sched-devel based patch if you like, but I think it
will apply trivially to both places.

Please consider it for inclusion.

Regards,
-Greg

Subject: fix cpus_allowed settings

We miss setting nr_cpus_allowed for the kthread case since the normal
set_cpus_allowed() function is not used.
