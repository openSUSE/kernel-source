+	 *  For RT we can't use IPIs to run drain_local_pages, since
+	 *  that code will call spin_locks that will now sleep.
+	 *  But, schedule_on_each_cpu will call kzalloc, which will
+	 *  call page_alloc which was what calls this.
+	 *
+	 *  Luckily, there's a condition to get here, and that is if
+	 *  the order passed in to alloc_pages is greater than 0
+	 *  (alloced more than a page size).  The slabs only allocate
+	 *  what is needed, and the allocation made by schedule_on_each_cpu
+	 *  does an alloc of "sizeof(void *)*nr_cpu_ids".
+	 *
+	 *  So we can safely call schedule_on_each_cpu if that number
+	 *  is less than a page. Otherwise don't bother. At least warn of
+	 *  this issue.
+	 *
+	 * And yes, this is one big hack.  Please fix ;-)
