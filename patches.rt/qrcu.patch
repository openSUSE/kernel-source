Subject: [PATCH] QRCU with lockless fastpath

Hello!

This is an updated version of Oleg Nesterov's QRCU that avoids the
earlier lock acquisition on the synchronize_qrcu() fastpath.  This passes
rcutorture on x86 and the weakly ordered POWER.  A promela model of the
code passes as noted before for 2 readers and 3 updaters and for 3 readers
and 2 updaters.  3 readers and 3 updaters runs every machine that I have
access to out of memory -- nothing like a little combinatorial explosion!
However, after some thought, the proof ended up being simple enough:

1.	If synchronize_qrcu() exits too soon, then by definition
	there has been a reader present during synchronize_srcu()'s
	full execution.

2.	The counter corresponding to this reader will be at least
	1 at all times.

3.	The synchronize_qrcu() code forces at least one of the counters
	to be at least one at all times -- if there is a reader, the
	sum will be at least two.  (Unfortunately, we cannot fetch
	the pair of counters atomically.)

4.	Therefore, the only way that synchronize_qrcu()s fastpath can
	see a sum of 1 is if it races with another synchronize_qrcu() --
	the first synchronize_qrcu() must read one of the counters before
	the second synchronize_qrcu() increments it, and must read the
	other counter after the second synchronize_qrcu() decrements it.
	There can be at most one reader present through this entire
	operation -- otherwise, the first synchronize_qrcu() will see
	a sum of 2 or greater.

5.	But the second synchronize_qrcu() will not release the mutex
	until after the reader is done.  During this time, the first
	synchronize_qrcu() will always see a sum of at least 2, and
	therefore cannot take the remainder of the fastpath until the
	reader is done.

6.	Because the second synchronize_qrcu() holds the mutex, no other
	synchronize_qrcu() can manipulate the counters until the reader
	is done.  A repeat of the race called out in #4 above therefore
	cannot happen until after the reader is done, in which case it
	is safe for the first synchronize_qrcu() to proceed.

Therefore, two summations of the counter separated by a memory barrier
suffices and the implementation shown below also suffices.

(And, yes, the fastpath -could- check for a sum of zero and exit
immediately, but this would help only in case of a three-way race
between two synchronize_qrcu()s and a qrcu_read_unlock(), would add
another compare, so is not worth it.)
