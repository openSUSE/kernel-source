Subject: [PATCH RFC 9/9] RCU: preemptible documentation and comment cleanups

Work in progress, not for inclusion.

This patch updates the RCU documentation to reflect preemptible RCU as
well as recent publications.  Fix an incorrect comment in the code. 
Change the name ORDERED_WRT_IRQ() to ACCESS_ONCE() to better describe
its function.

+By the same token, RCU can be thought of as a "bulk reference count",

+RCU, the reference counter is the per-CPU bit in the "bitmask" field,
