Subject: Linux-RT 2.6.27-RT
From: http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/
Acked-by: Tony Jones <tonyj@suse.de>
From: Steven Rostedt <srostedt@redhat.com>

With the added boost of SCHED_OTHER, the balancing load starts to stain
latencies. Bring it back down again.

NOTE: This is a workaround, we need to fix this because this work around
will once again hurt SCHED_OTHER performance.
