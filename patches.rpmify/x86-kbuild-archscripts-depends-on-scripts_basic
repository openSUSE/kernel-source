Subject: x86/kbuild: archscripts depends on scripts_basic
Patch-mainline: Submitted 20 Sep 2012

While building the SUSE kernel packages, which build the scripts,
make clean, and then build everything, we have been running into spurious
build failures. We tracked them down to a simple dependency issue:

$ make mrproper
  CLEAN   arch/x86/tools
  CLEAN   scripts/basic
$ cp patches/config/x86_64/desktop .config
$ make archscripts
  HOSTCC  arch/x86/tools/relocs
/bin/sh: scripts/basic/fixdep: No such file or directory
make[3]: *** [arch/x86/tools/relocs] Error 1
make[2]: *** [archscripts] Error 2
make[1]: *** [sub-make] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2

This was introduced by commit
6520fe55 (x86, realmode: 16-bit real-mode code support for relocs),
which added the archscripts dependency to archprepare.

This patch adds the scripts_basic dependency to the x86 archscripts.
