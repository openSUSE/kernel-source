Subject: lustre/lloop: don't change the logical size for the queue
Patch-mainline: not yet; Posted to Lustre Gerrit

On ppc64 with 64k pages, we get a build failure in lloop:

drivers/staging/lustre/lustre/llite/lloop.c:527:2: note: in expansion of macro 'CLASSERT'
CLASSERT(PAGE_CACHE_SIZE < (1 << (sizeof(unsigned short) * 8)));

There's no need to change the queue's logical block size. Even if it could
accept a 64k value, that would result in any file system on top of it
needing to also use 64k blocks. It'd be safe to set it to 4k, but there's
no actual need for it. It's not used to split requests except for WRITE_SAME,
which lloop doesn't implement anyway.
