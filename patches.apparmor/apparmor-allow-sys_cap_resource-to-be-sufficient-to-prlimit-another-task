Subject: apparmor: allow SYS_CAP_RESOURCE to be sufficient to prlimit another
 task
References: bsc#921949
Patch-mainline: Submitted, apparmor@lists.ubuntu.com 6 Nov 2015

While using AppArmor, SYS_CAP_RESOURCE is insufficient to call prlimit
on another task. The only other example of a AppArmor mediating access to
another, already running, task (ignoring fork+exec) is ptrace.

The AppArmor model for ptrace is that one of the following must be true:
1) The tracer is unconfined
2) The tracer is in complain mode
3) The tracer and tracee are confined by the same profile
4) The tracer is confined but has SYS_CAP_PTRACE

1), 2, and 3) are already true for setrlimit.

We can match the ptrace model just by allowing CAP_SYS_RESOURCE.

We still test the values of the rlimit since it can always be overriden
using a value that means unlimited for a particular resource.
