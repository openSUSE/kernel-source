=== kernel-debug ===
A Debug Version of the Kernel

This kernel has several debug facilities enabled that hurt performance.
Only use this kernel when investigating problems.

=== kernel-default ===
The Standard Kernel

The standard kernel for both uniprocessor and multiprocessor systems.

=== kernel-desktop ===
Kernel optimized for the desktop

This kernel is optimized for the desktop. It is configured for lower latency
and has many of the features that aren't usually used on desktop machines
disabled.

%ifarch %ix86
This kernel supports up to 64GB of main memory. It requires Physical
Addressing Extensions (PAE), which were introduced with the Pentium Pro
processor.

PAE is not only more physical address space but also important for the
"no execute" feature which disables execution of code that is marked as
non-executable. Therefore, the PAE kernel should be used on any systems
that support it, regardless of the amount of main memory.

=== kernel-pae ===
Kernel with PAE Support

This kernel supports up to 64GB of main memory. It requires Physical
Addressing Extensions (PAE), which were introduced with the Pentium Pro
processor.

PAE is not only more physical address space but also important for the
"no execute" feature which disables execution of code that is marked as
non-executable. Therefore, the PAE kernel should be used on any systems
that support it, regardless of the amount of main memory.

=== kernel-vanilla ===
The Standard Kernel - without any SUSE patches

The standard kernel - without any SUSE patches

=== kernel-xen ===
The Xen Kernel

The Linux kernel for Xen paravirtualization.

This kernel can be used both as the domain0 ("xen0") and as an
unprivileged ("xenU") kernel.

=== kernel-ec2 ===
The Amazon EC2 Xen Kernel

The Linux kernel for Xen paravirtualization.

This kernel can only be used as an unprivileged ("xenU") kernel
(mainly, but not exclusively, for Amazon EC2).

=== kernel-pv ===
The para-virtualized Kernel

The Linux kernel for Xen (and other) paravirtualization, using pv-ops
in the Xen/x86 case, in which case it can be used both as the domain0
("xen0") and as an unprivileged ("xenU") kernel.

=== kernel-lpae ===
Kernel for LPAE enabled systems

The kernel for all 32-bit ARM platforms that support LPAE. This includes all
Cortex A15 based SoCs, like the Exynos5, OMAP5 or Calxeda ECX-2000.

=== kernel-cubox ===
Kernel for SolidRun Cubox

The standard kernel for Marvell Dove SoC, as found in
the SolidRun Cubox.

=== kernel-exynos ===
Kernel for Samsung's Exynos SoC

The standard kernel for Samsung's Exynos 4 & 5 SoC, as found in the Origen board.

=== kernel-versatile ===
Kernel for Versatile SoC

The standard kernel for Versatile SoC, or for emulation with QEMU.
