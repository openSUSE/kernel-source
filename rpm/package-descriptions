=== kernel-debug ===
A Debug Version of the Kernel

This kernel has several debug facilities enabled that hurt performance.
Only use this kernel when investigating problems.

=== kernel-default ===
The Standard Kernel

The standard kernel for both uniprocessor and multiprocessor systems.

=== kernel-desktop ===
Kernel optimized for the desktop

This kernel is optimized for the desktop. It is configured for lower latency
and has many of the features that aren't usually used on desktop machines
disabled.

%ifarch %ix86
This kernel supports up to 64GB of main memory. It requires Physical
Addressing Extensions (PAE), which were introduced with the Pentium Pro
processor.

PAE is not only more physical address space but also important for the
"no execute" feature which disables execution of code that is marked as
non-executable. Therefore, the PAE kernel should be used on any systems
that support it, regardless of the amount of main memory.
%endif

=== kernel-kdump ===
kernel for kdump

This kernel is intended for kdump. It can not be booted with a normal
bootloader, the kexec tool has to be used to load it. Once the system
crashes, the loaded kernel will be started to grab debug info from the
crashed kernel.

=== kernel-pae ===
Kernel with PAE Support

This kernel supports up to 64GB of main memory. It requires Physical
Addressing Extensions (PAE), which were introduced with the Pentium Pro
processor.

PAE is not only more physical address space but also important for the
"no execute" feature which disables execution of code that is marked as
non-executable. Therefore, the PAE kernel should be used on any systems
that support it, regardless of the amount of main memory.

=== kernel-ppc64 ===
Kernel for ppc64 Systems

This package contains the kernel for:

IBM pSeries 64bit machines IBM iSeries 64bit machines Apple G5 machines
Sony Playstation 3

The boot file is /boot/vmlinux.

The home page of the ppc64 project is http://www.penguinppc.org/

=== kernel-ps3 ===
kernel for ps3 bootloader

This package contains the kernel for the PS3 bootloader. PS3 systems
only have 4MB of flash memory for the bootloader, so this kernel needs
to be as small as possible and is _not_ meant to be installed in the
final system.

=== kernel-s390 ===
The Standard Kernel

The standard kernel.

=== kernel-trace ===
The Realtime Linux Kernel

This kernel is compiled for realtime applications.

=== kernel-vanilla ===
The Standard Kernel - without any SUSE patches

The standard kernel - without any SUSE patches

=== kernel-xen ===
The Xen Kernel

The Linux kernel for Xen paravirtualization.

This kernel can be used both as the domain0 ("xen0") and as an
unprivileged ("xenU") kernel.

=== kernel-ec2 ===
The Amazon EC2 Xen Kernel

The Linux kernel for Xen paravirtualization.

This kernel can only be used both as an unprivileged ("xenU")
kernel (for Amazon EC2).
