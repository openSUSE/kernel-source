=== kernel-debug ===
A Debug Version of the Kernel

This kernel has several debug facilities enabled that hurt performance.
Only use this kernel when investigating problems.

=== kernel-default ===
The Standard Kernel

The standard kernel for both uniprocessor and multiprocessor systems.

=== kernel-kvmsmall ===
The Small Developer Kernel for KVM

This kernel is intended for kernel developers to use in simple virtual
machines.  It contains only the device drivers necessary to use a
KVM virtual machine *without* device passthrough enabled.  Common
local and network file systems are enabled.  All device mapper targets
are enabled.  Only the network and graphics drivers for devices that qemu
emulates are enabled.  Many subsystems enabled in the default kernel
are entirely disabled.  This kernel is meant to be small and to build
very quickly.  The configuration may change arbitrarily between builds.

=== kernel-azure ===
Kernel for MS Azure cloud

Kernel for use in the MS Azure cloud and other Hyper-V based virtualization
solutions.

=== kernel-pae ===
Kernel with PAE Support

This kernel supports up to 64GB of main memory. It requires Physical
Addressing Extensions (PAE), which were introduced with the Pentium Pro
processor.

PAE is not only more physical address space but also important for the
"no execute" feature which disables execution of code that is marked as
non-executable. Therefore, the PAE kernel should be used on any systems
that support it, regardless of the amount of main memory.

=== kernel-vanilla ===
The Standard Kernel - without any SUSE patches

The standard kernel - without any SUSE patches

=== kernel-64kb ===
Kernel with 64kb PAGE_SIZE

This kernel is identical to the default kernel, but is configured with
64kb page size granule. Its main purpose is to serve as compatibility
kernel for systems that were installed when the default kernel was still
configured with 64kb page size granule.

=== kernel-lpae ===
Kernel for LPAE enabled systems

The kernel for all 32-bit ARM platforms that support LPAE. This includes all
Cortex A15 based SoCs, like the Exynos5, OMAP5 or Calxeda ECX-2000.

=== kernel-preempt ===
Kernel with PREEMPT support

The kernel for arm64 and x86_64 architectures that supports CONFIG_PREEMPT. Its
main purpose is to serve workloads with a higher demand on smaller latencies
than the default kernel in average.

=== kernel-syzkaller ===
Kernel used for fuzzing by syzkaller

The syzkaller kernel should be used solely in a virtual machine by
syzkaller only. It supports kernel coverage and enables a lot of slow
debugging options.

=== kernel-zfcpdump ===
The IBM System Z zfcpdump Kernel

The Linux kernel for booting the zfcpdump process on IBM System Z.

This kernel should only be used by the s390-tools package. This kernel
should not be installed as a regular booting kernel.

=== cluster-md-kmp ===
Summary: Clustering support for MD devices
Requires: dlm-kmp

Clustering support for MD devices. This enables locking and
synchronization across multiple systems on the cluster, so all
nodes in the cluster can access the MD devices simultaneously.

=== dlm-kmp ===
DLM kernel modules

DLM stands for Distributed Lock Manager, a means to synchronize access to
shared resources over the cluster.

=== gfs2-kmp ===
Summary: GFS2 kernel modules
Requires: dlm-kmp

GFS2 is Global Filesystem, a shared device filesystem.

=== ocfs2-kmp ===
Summary: OCFS2 kernel modules
Requires: dlm-kmp

OCFS2 is the Oracle Cluster Filesystem, a filesystem for shared devices
accessible simultaneously from multiple nodes of a cluster.

=== kselftests-kmp ===
Kernel sefltests

This package contains kernel modules which are part of the upstream kernel
selftest effort. kselftest is the name of the upstream kernel target to build
and run all selftests. You can also run each test individually from the
respective upstream tools/testing/selftests/ directory, this package is
intended to be used using individial upstream selftest scripts given only
select supported selftest drivers are enabled.

It should always be possible to always run the latest linux-next version of the
selftest scripts and tests against any older kernel selftest driver.  Certain
tests facilities may be backported onto older kernels to enable further
testing.

Selftests also provide for a vehicle or proof of concept issues to be
reproduced, verified and corrected.

Selftest drivers are intended to be supported only in testing and QA
environments, they are not intended to be run on production systems.

=== reiserfs-kmp ===
Reiserfs kernel module

The reiserfs file system is no longer supported in SLE15.  This package
provides the reiserfs module for the installation system.
