Subject: [PATCH] cifs: call cifs_reconnect when a connection is marked
Git-commit: a81da65fbae6436e1e2f415532b8aacc3274d840
References: bsc#1193629
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc4

In cifsd thread, we should continue to call cifs_reconnect
whenever server->tcpStatus is marked as CifsNeedReconnect.
This was inexplicably removed by one of my recent commits.
Fixing that here.
