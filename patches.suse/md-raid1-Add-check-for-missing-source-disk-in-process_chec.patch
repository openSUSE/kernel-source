Subject: md/raid1: Add check for missing source disk in process_checks()
Git-commit: b7c178d9e57c8fd4238ff77263b877f6f16182ba
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc3
References: git-fixes

During recovery/check operations, the process_checks function loops
through available disks to find a 'primary' source with successfully
read data.

If no suitable source disk is found after checking all possibilities,
the 'primary' index will reach conf->raid_disks * 2. Add an explicit
check for this condition after the loop. If no source disk was found,
print an error message and return early to prevent further processing
without a valid primary source.
