Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda: update the power_state during the direct-complete
Git-commit: b8b90c17602689eeaa5b219d104bbc215d1225cc
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc5
References: git-fixes

The patch_realtek.c needs to check if the power_state.event equals
PM_EVENT_SUSPEND, after using the direct-complete, the suspend() and
resume() will be skipped if the codec is already rt_suspended, in this
case, the patch_realtek.c will always get PM_EVENT_ON even the system
is really resumed from S3.

We could set power_state to PMSG_SUSPEND in the prepare(), if other
PM functions are called before complete(), those functions will
override power_state; if no other PM functions are called before
complete(), we could know the suspend() and resume() are skipped since
only S3 pm functions could be skipped by direct-complete, in this case
set power_state to PMSG_RESUME in the complete(). This could guarantee
the first time of calling hda_codec_runtime_resume() after complete()
has the correct power_state.
