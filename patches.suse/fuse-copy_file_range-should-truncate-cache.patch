Subject: [PATCH] fuse: copy_file_range should truncate cache 
Git-commit: 9b46418c40fe910e6537618f9932a8be78a3dd6c
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1

After the copy operation completes the cache is not up-to-date.  Truncate
all pages in the interval that has successfully been copied.

Truncating completely copied dirty pages is okay, since the data has been
overwritten anyway.  Truncating partially copied dirty pages is not okay;
add a comment for now.
