Subject: drm/i915/selftests: Ignore coherency failures on Broadwater
Git-commit: 325b916a9e1b11d28c40b02e24734750946a1785
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: bsc#1152489

We've been ignoring similar coherency issues in IGT for Broadwater, and
specifically Broadwater (original gen4) and not, for example, Crestline
(same generation as Broadwater, but the mobile variant). Without any
means to reproduce locally (I have a 965GM but alas no 965G), fixing will
be slow, so tell CI to ignore any failure until we are ready with a fix.
