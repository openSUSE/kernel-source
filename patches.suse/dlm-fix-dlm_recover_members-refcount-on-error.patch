Subject: [PATCH] dlm: fix dlm_recover_members refcount on error
Git-commit: 200b977ebbc313a59174ba971006a231b3533dc5
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
References: git-fixes CVE-2024-56749 bsc#1235628

If dlm_recover_members() fails we don't drop the references of the
previous created root_list that holds and keep all rsbs alive during the
recovery. It might be not an unlikely event because ping_members() could
run into an -EINTR if another recovery progress was triggered again.

Fixes: 3a747f4a2ee8 ("dlm: move rsb root_list to ls_recover() stack")
