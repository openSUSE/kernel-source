Subject: net: phylink: add support for polling MAC PCS

Git-commit: 1511ed0a0167f523a84b4e727372a5d2ce1b6c2f
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-9263

Some MAC PCS blocks are unable to provide interrupts when their status
changes. As we already have support in phylink for polling status, use
this to provide a hook for MACs to enable polling mode.

The patch idea was picked up from Russell King's suggestion on the macb
phylink patch thread here [0] but the implementation was changed.
Instead of introducing a new phylink_start_poll() function, which would
make the implementation cumbersome for common PHYLINK implementations
for multiple types of devices, like DSA, just add a boolean property to
the phylink_config structure, which is just as backwards-compatible.
