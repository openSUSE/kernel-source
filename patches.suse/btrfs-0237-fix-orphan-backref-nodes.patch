Subject: [PATCH] Btrfs: fix orphan backref nodes

If the root node of a fs/file tree is in the block group that is
being relocated, but the others are not in the other block groups.
when we create a snapshot for this tree between the relocation tree
creation ends and ->create_reloc_tree is set to 0, Btrfs will create
some backref nodes that are the lowest nodes of the backrefs cache.
But we forget to add them into ->leaves list of the backref cache
and deal with them, and at last, they will triggered BUG_ON().

  kernel BUG at fs/btrfs/relocation.c:239!

This patch fixes it by adding them into ->leaves list of backref cache.
