Subject: [PATCH] drm/msm/dp: delete DP_RECOVERED_CLOCK_OUT_EN to fix tps4
Git-commit: 032d57960176ac01cc5adff5bcc5eb51317f8781
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc4
References: git-fixes
Alt-commit: 3487896b26269f5430596711490a7c48d2941d9d

Data Symbols scrambled is required for tps4 at link training 2.
Therefore SCRAMBLING_DISABLE bit should not be set for tps4 to
work.

RECOVERED_CLOCK_OUT_EN is for enable simple EYE test for jitter
measurement with minimal equipment for embedded applications purpose
and is not required to be set during normal operation. Current
implementation always have RECOVERED_CLOCK_OUT_EN bit set which
cause SCRAMBLING_DISABLE bit wrongly set at tps4 which prevent
tps4 from working.

This patch delete setting RECOVERED_CLOCK_OUT_EN to fix
SCRAMBLING_DISABLE be wrongly set at tps4.
