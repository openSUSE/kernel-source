Subject: sctp: shrink stream outq when fails to do addstream reconf
Git-commit: 3ecdda3e9ad837cf9cb41b6faa11b1af3a5abc0c
Patch-mainline: 5.8-rc7
References: networking-stable-20_07_29

When adding a stream with stream reconf, the new stream firstly is in
CLOSED state but new out chunks can still be enqueued. Then once gets
the confirmation from the peer, the state will change to OPEN.

However, if the peer denies, it needs to roll back the stream. But when
doing that, it only sets the stream outcnt back, and the chunks already
in the new stream don't get purged. It caused these chunks can still be
dequeued in sctp_outq_dequeue_data().

As its stream is still in CLOSE, the chunk will be enqueued to the head
again by sctp_outq_head_data(). This chunk will never be sent out, and
the chunks after it can never be dequeued. The assoc will be 'hung' in
a dead loop of sending this chunk.

To fix it, this patch is to purge these chunks already in the new
stream by calling sctp_stream_shrink_out() when failing to do the
addstream reconf.
