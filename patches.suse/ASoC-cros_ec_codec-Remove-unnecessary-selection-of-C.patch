Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: cros_ec_codec: Remove unnecessary selection of CRYPTO
Git-commit: 8fb817335ad8d960ea05af3882cea113e59cb4e1
Patch-mainline: v6.19-rc1
References: jsc#PED-14430 jsc#PED-14297 jsc#PED-14024

The only crypto-related functionality this codec uses is the sha256()
function, which is provided by CRYPTO_LIB_SHA256.  Originally
CRYPTO_LIB_SHA256 was visible only when CRYPTO; however, that was fixed
years ago and the libraries can now be selected on their own.

So, remove the unnecessary selection of CRYPTO.
