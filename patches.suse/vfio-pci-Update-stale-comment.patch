Subject: vfio/pci: Update stale comment
Git-commit: 9387cf59dc6f987db875148dd596c45bc60813f8
Patch-mainline: 6.5-rc1
References: jsc#PED-7785

In preparation for surrounding code change it is helpful to
ensure that existing comments are accurate.

Remove inaccurate comment about direct access and update
the rest of the comment to reflect the purpose of writing
the cached MSI message to the device.
