Subject: [PATCH] Revert "ASoC: cs43130: fix a NULL pointer dereference"
Git-commit: fdda0dd2686ecd1f2e616c9e0366ea71b40c485d
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc3
References: git-fixes

This reverts commit a2be42f18d409213bb7e7a736e3ef6ba005115bb.

Because of recent interactions with developers from @umn.edu, all
commits from them have been recently re-reviewed to ensure if they were
correct or not.

Upon review, this commit was found to be incorrect for the reasons
below, so it must be reverted.  It will be fixed up "correctly" in a
later kernel change.

The original patch here is not correct, sysfs files that were created
are not unwound.
