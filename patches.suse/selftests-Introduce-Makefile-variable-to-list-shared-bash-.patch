Subject: selftests: Introduce Makefile variable to list shared bash scripts
Git-commit: 2a0683be5b4c9829e8335e494a21d1148e832822
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: bsc#1254235

Some tests written in bash source other files in a parent directory. For
example, drivers/net/bonding/dev_addr_lists.sh sources
net/forwarding/lib.sh. If a subset of tests is exported and run outside the
source tree (for example by using `make -C tools/testing/selftests gen_tar
TARGETS="drivers/net/bonding"`), these other files must be made available
as well.

Commit ae108c48b5d2 ("selftests: net: Fix cross-tree inclusion of scripts")
addressed this problem by symlinking and copying the sourced files but this
only works for direct dependencies. Commit 25ae948b4478 ("selftests/net:
add lib.sh") changed net/forwarding/lib.sh to source net/lib.sh. As a
result, that latter file must be included as well when the former is
exported. This was not handled and was reverted in commit 2114e83381d3
("selftests: forwarding: Avoid failures to source net/lib.sh"). In order to
allow reinstating the inclusion of net/lib.sh from net/forwarding/lib.sh,
add a mechanism to list dependent files in a new Makefile variable and
export them. This allows sourcing those files using the same expression
whether tests are run in-tree or exported.

Dependencies are not resolved recursively so transitive dependencies must
be listed in TEST_INCLUDES. For example, if net/forwarding/lib.sh sources
net/lib.sh; the Makefile related to a test that sources
net/forwarding/lib.sh from a parent directory must list:
TEST_INCLUDES := \
	../../../net/forwarding/lib.sh \
	../../../net/lib.sh

v2:
Fix rst syntax in Documentation/dev-tools/kselftest.rst (Jakub Kicinski)

v1 (from RFC):
* changed TEST_INCLUDES to take relative paths, like other TEST_* variables
  (Vladimir Oltean)
* preserved common "$(MAKE) OUTPUT=... -C ... target" ordering in Makefile
  (Petr Machata)
