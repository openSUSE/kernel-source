Subject: [PATCH] driver core: Avoid binding drivers to dead devices
Git-commit: 654888327e9f655a9d55ad477a9583e90e8c9b5c
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc1
References: git-fixes

Commit 3451a495ef24 ("driver core: Establish order of operations for
device_add and device_del via bitflag") sought to prevent asynchronous
driver binding to a device which is being removed.  It added a
per-device "dead" flag which is checked in the following code paths:

* asynchronous binding in __driver_attach_async_helper()
*  synchronous binding in device_driver_attach()
* asynchronous binding in __device_attach_async_helper()

It did *not* check the flag upon:

*  synchronous binding in __device_attach()

However __device_attach() may also be called asynchronously from:

deferred_probe_work_func()
  bus_probe_device()
    device_initial_probe()
      __device_attach()

So if the commit's intention was to check the "dead" flag in all
asynchronous code paths, then a check is also necessary in
__device_attach().  Add the missing check.
