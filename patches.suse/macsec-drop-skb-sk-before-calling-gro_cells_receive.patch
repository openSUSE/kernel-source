Subject: macsec: drop skb sk before calling gro_cells_receive
Git-commit: ba56d8ce38c8252fff5b745db3899cf092578ede
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.4

Fei Liu reported a crash when doing netperf on a topo of macsec
dev over veth:

  [  448.919128] refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.

The issue was caused by skb's true_size changed without its sk's
sk_wmem_alloc increased in tcp/skb_gro_receive(). Later when the
skb is being freed and the skb's truesize is subtracted from its
sk's sk_wmem_alloc in tcp_wfree(), underflow occurs.

macsec is calling gro_cells_receive() to receive a packet, which
actually requires skb->sk to be NULL. However when macsec dev is
over veth, it's possible the skb->sk is still set if the skb was
not unshared or expanded from the peer veth.

ip_rcv() is calling skb_orphan() to drop the skb's sk for tproxy,
but it is too late for macsec's calling gro_cells_receive(). So
fix it by dropping the skb's sk earlier on rx path of macsec.
