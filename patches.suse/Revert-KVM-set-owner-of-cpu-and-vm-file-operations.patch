Subject: Revert "KVM: set owner of cpu and vm file operations"
Git-commit: 70375c2d8fa3fb9b0b59207a9c5df1e2e1205c10
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: git-fixes

This reverts commit 3d3aab1b973b01bd2a1aa46307e94a1380b1d802.

Now that the KVM module's lifetime is tied to kvm.users_count, there is
no need to also tie it's lifetime to the lifetime of the VM and vCPU
file descriptors.
