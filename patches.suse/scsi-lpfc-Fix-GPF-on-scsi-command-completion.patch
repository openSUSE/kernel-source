Subject: scsi: lpfc: Fix GPF on scsi command completion
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
Git-commit: 9df0a0381a600438d19def2c3868c02871e0cd72
References: jsc#SLE-8284 jsc#SLE-8654

Faults are seen with RIP of lpfc_scsi_cmd_iocb_cmpl().  The failure is when
lpfc_update_status is being called as part of the completion.  After
debugging, it was seen the issue was the shost pointer that the driver
derived from the scsi cmd.  The crash showed the cmd->device pointer being
bogus, which is likely as the scsi devices were offlined prior. The bogus
device pointer caused subsequent pointers derived from the location,
specifically the vport, to be bogus.

Fix by adjusting the calling sequence to pass in the vport rather than
having to derive it from the cmd structure.
