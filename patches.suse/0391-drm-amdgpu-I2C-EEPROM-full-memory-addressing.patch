Subject: drm/amdgpu: I2C EEPROM full memory addressing
Git-commit: 025a64a58792523ffbae042ef0cf54de9c6a27f1
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

* "eeprom_addr" is now 32-bit wide.
* Remove "slave_addr" from the I2C EEPROM driver
  interface. The I2C EEPROM Device Type Identifier
  is fixed at 1010b, and the rest of the bits
  of the Device Address Byte/Device Select Code,
  are memory address bits, where the first three
  of those bits are the hardware selection bits.
  All this is now a 19-bit address and passed
  as "eeprom_addr". This abstracts the I2C bus
  for EEPROM devices for this I2C EEPROM driver.
  Now clients only pass the 19-bit EEPROM memory
  address, to the I2C EEPROM driver, as the 32-bit
  "eeprom_addr", from which they want to read from
  or write to.

+/* EEPROM memory addresses are 19-bits long, which can
+ * be partitioned into 3, 8, 8 bits, for a total of 19.
+ * The upper 3 bits are sent as part of the 7-bit
+ * "Device Type Identifier"--an I2C concept, which for EEPROM devices
+ * is hard-coded as 1010b, indicating that it is an EEPROM
+ * device--this is the wire format, followed by the upper
+ * 3 bits of the 19-bit address, followed by the direction,
+ * followed by two bytes holding the rest of the 16-bits of
+ * the EEPROM memory address. The format on the wire for EEPROM
+ * devices is: 1010XYZD, A15:A8, A7:A0,
+ * Where D is the direction and sequenced out by the hardware.
+ * Bits XYZ are memory address bits 18, 17 and 16.
+ * These bits are compared to how pins 1-3 of the part are connected,
+ * depending on the size of the part, more on that later.
+ *
+ * Note that of this wire format, a client is in control
+ * of, and needs to specify only XYZ, A15:A8, A7:0, bits,
+ * which is exactly the EEPROM memory address, or offset,
+ * in order to address up to 8 EEPROM devices on the I2C bus.
+ *
+ * For instance, a 2-Mbit I2C EEPROM part, addresses all its bytes,
+ * using an 18-bit address, bit 17 to 0 and thus would use all but one bit of
+ * the 19 bits previously mentioned. The designer would then not connect
+ * pins 1 and 2, and pin 3 usually named "A_2" or "E2", would be connected to
+ * either Vcc or GND. This would allow for up to two 2-Mbit parts on
+ * the same bus, where one would be addressable with bit 18 as 1, and
+ * the other with bit 18 of the address as 0.
+ *
+ * For a 2-Mbit part, bit 18 is usually known as the "Chip Enable" or
+ * "Hardware Address Bit". This bit is compared to the load on pin 3
+ * of the device, described above, and if there is a match, then this
+ * device responds to the command. This way, you can connect two
+ * 2-Mbit EEPROM devices on the same bus, but see one contiguous
+ * memory from 0 to 7FFFFh, where address 0 to 3FFFF is in the device
+ * whose pin 3 is connected to GND, and address 40000 to 7FFFFh is in
+ * the 2nd device, whose pin 3 is connected to Vcc.
+ *
+ * This addressing you encode in the 32-bit "eeprom_addr" below,
+ * namely the 19-bits "XYZ,A15:A0", as a single 19-bit address. For
+ * instance, eeprom_addr = 0x6DA01, is 110_1101_1010_0000_0001, where
+ * XYZ=110b, and A15:A0=DA01h. The XYZ bits become part of the device
+ * address, and the rest of the address bits are sent as the memory
+ * address bytes.
+ *
+ * That is, for an I2C EEPROM driver everything is controlled by
+ * the "eeprom_addr".
+ *
+ * P.S. If you need to write, lock and read the Identification Page,
+ * (M24M02-DR device only, which we do not use), change the "7" to
+ * "0xF" in the macro below, and let the client set bit 20 to 1 in
+ * "eeprom_addr", and set A10 to 0 to write into it, and A10 and A1 to
+ * 1 to lock it permanently.
