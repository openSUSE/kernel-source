Subject: [PATCH] ping: fix the sk_bound_dev_if match in ping_lookup

When 'ping' changes to use PING socket instead of RAW socket by:

   # sysctl -w net.ipv4.ping_group_range="0 100"

the selftests 'router_broadcast.sh' will fail, as such command

  # ip vrf exec vrf-h1 ping -I veth0 198.51.100.255 -b

can't receive the response skb by the PING socket. It's caused by mismatch
of sk_bound_dev_if and dif in ping_rcv() when looking up the PING socket,
as dif is vrf-h1 if dif's master was set to vrf-h1.

This patch is to fix this regression by also checking the sk_bound_dev_if
against sdif so that the packets can stil be received even if the socket
is not bound to the vrf device but to the real iif.
