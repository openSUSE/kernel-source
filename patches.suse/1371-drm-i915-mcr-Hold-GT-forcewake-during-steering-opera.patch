Subject: drm/i915/mcr: Hold GT forcewake during steering operations
Git-commit: 78cc55e0b64c820673a796635daf82c7eadfe152
Patch-mainline: v6.6
References: drm-backport-placeholder jsc#PED-3527 jsc#PED-5475 jsc#PED-6068 jsc#PED-6070 jsc#PED-6116 jsc#PED-6120 jsc#PED-5065 jsc#PED-5477 jsc#PED-5511 jsc#PED-6041 jsc#PED-6069 jsc#PED-6071

The steering control and semaphore registers are inside an "always on"
power domain with respect to RC6.  However there are some issues if
higher-level platform sleep states are entering/exiting at the same time
these registers are accessed.  Grabbing GT forcewake and holding it over
the entire lock/steer/unlock cycle ensures that those sleep states have
been fully exited before we access these registers.

This is expected to become a formally documented/numbered workaround
soon.

Note that this patch alone isn't expected to have an immediately
noticeable impact on MCR (mis)behavior; an upcoming pcode firmware
update will also be necessary to provide the other half of this
workaround.

v2:
 - Move the forcewake inside the Xe_LPG-specific IP version check.  This
   should only be necessary on platforms that have a steering semaphore.
