Subject: [PATCH] nvme-pci: dma read memory barrier for completions
Git-commit: b69e2ef24b7b4867f80f47e2781e95d0bacd15cb
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc6
References: git-fixes

Control dependencies do not guarantee load order across the condition,
allowing a CPU to predict and speculate memory reads.

Commit 324b494c2862 inlined verifying a new completion with its
handling. At least one architecture was observed to access the contents
out of order, resulting in the driver using stale data for the
completion.

Add a dma read barrier before reading the completion queue entry and
after the condition its contents depend on to ensure the read order is
determinsitic.
