Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: amd: acp: Fix pointer assignments for snd_soc_acpi_mach structures
Git-commit: 0779c0ad2a7cc0ae1865860c9bc8732613cc56b1
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc1
References: jsc#PED-14430 jsc#PED-14297 jsc#PED-14024

This patch modifies the assignment of machine structure pointers in the
acp_pci_probe function. Previously, the machine pointers were assigned
using the address-of operator (&), which caused incompatibility issues
in type assignments.

Additionally, the declarations of the machine arrays in amd.h have been
updated to reflect that they are indeed arrays (`[]`). The code is
further cleaned up by declaring the codec structures in
amd-acpi-mach.c as static, reflecting their intended usage.

Error: symbol 'amp_rt1019' was not declared. Should it be static?
Error: symbol 'amp_max' was not declared. Should it be static?
Error: symbol 'snd_soc_acpi_amd_acp_machines' was not declared. Should it be static?
Error: symbol 'snd_soc_acpi_amd_rmb_acp_machines' was not declared. Should it be static?
Error: symbol 'snd_soc_acpi_amd_acp63_acp_machines' was not declared. Should it be static?
Error: symbol 'snd_soc_acpi_amd_acp70_acp_machines' was not declared. Should it be static?
