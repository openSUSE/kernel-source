Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/hdmi: remove redundant assignment to variable pcm_idx
Git-commit: f953e72c9ca60ef13bb9680af8a5baf92cb93e52
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: git-fixes

Variable pcm_idx is being initialized with a value that is never read
and is being re-assigned immediately afterwards. The assignment is
redundant and hence can be removed.

Addresses-coverity: ("Unused value")
