Subject: drm/i915/selftests: Force bonded submission to overlap
Git-commit: cfd821b2439c7eaf56ac473b1233b66dbe342c12
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-12680, jsc#SLE-12880, jsc#SLE-12882, jsc#SLE-12883, jsc#SLE-13496, jsc#SLE-15322

Bonded request submission is designed to allow requests to execute in
parallel as laid out by the user. If the master request is already
finished before its bonded pair is submitted, the pair were not destined
to run in parallel and we lose the information about the master engine
to dictate selection of the secondary. If the second request was
required to be run on a particular engine in a virtual set, that should
have been specified, rather than left to the whims of a random
unconnected requests!

In the selftest, I made the mistake of not ensuring the master would
overlap with its bonded pairs, meaning that it could indeed complete
before we submitted the bonds. Those bonds were then free to select any
available engine in their virtual set, and not the one expected by the
test.

+	 * A set of bonded requests is intended to be run concurrently
+	 * across a number of engines. We use one request per-engine
+	 * and a magic fence to schedule each of the bonded requests
+	 * at the same time. A consequence of our current scheduler is that
+	 * we only move requests to the HW ready queue when the request
+	 * becomes ready, that is when all of its prerequisite fences have
+	 * been signaled. As one of those fences is the master submit fence,
+	 * there is a delay on all secondary fences as the HW may be
+	 * currently busy. Equally, as all the requests are independent,
+	 * they may have other fences that delay individual request
+	 * submission to HW. Ergo, we do not guarantee that all requests are
+	 * immediately submitted to HW at the same time, just that if the
+	 * rules are abided by, they are ready at the same time as the
+	 * first is submitted. Userspace can embed semaphores in its batch
+	 * to ensure parallel execution of its phases as it requires.
+	 * Though naturally it gets requested that perhaps the scheduler should
+	 * take care of parallel execution, even across preemption events on
+	 * different HW. (The proper answer is of course "lalalala".)
+	 *
+	 * With the submit-fence, we have identified three possible phases
+	 * of synchronisation depending on the master fence: queued (not
+	 * ready), executing, and signaled. The first two are quite simple
+	 * and checked below. However, the signaled master fence handling is
+	 * contentious. Currently we do not distinguish between a signaled
+	 * fence and an expired fence, as once signaled it does not convey
+	 * any information about the previous execution. It may even be freed
+	 * and hence checking later it may not exist at all. Ergo we currently
+	 * do not apply the bonding constraint for an already signaled fence,
+	 * as our expectation is that it should not constrain the secondaries
+	 * and is outside of the scope of the bonded request API (i.e. all
+	 * userspace requests are meant to be running in parallel). As
+	 * it imposes no constraint, and is effectively a no-op, we do not
+	 * check below as normal execution flows are checked extensively above.
+	 *
+	 * XXX Is the degenerate handling of signaled submit fences the
+	 * expected behaviour for userpace?
