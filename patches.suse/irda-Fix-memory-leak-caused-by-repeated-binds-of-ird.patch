Subject: irda: Fix memory leak caused by repeated binds of irda socket
Patch-mainline: Never, driver dropped in mainline (4.17-rc1)
References: CVE-2018-6554 bsc#1106509

The irda_bind() function allocates memory for self->ias_obj without
checking to see if the socket is already bound. A userspace process
could repeatedly bind the socket, have each new object added into the
LM-IAS database, and lose the reference to the old object assigned to
the socket to exhaust memory resources. This patch errors out of the
bind operation when self->ias_obj is already assigned.

CVE-2018-6554
