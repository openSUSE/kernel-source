Subject: ACPI: OSL: Use usleep_range() in acpi_os_sleep()
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc1
Git-commit: bede543d2f8a045030ea6ed49307719673342613
References: jsc#PED-14260

As stated by Len in [1], the extra delay added by msleep() to the
sleep time value passed to it can be significant, roughly between
1.5 ns on systems with HZ = 1000 and as much as 15 ms on systems with
HZ = 100, which is hardly acceptable, at least for small sleep time
values.

msleep(5) on the default HZ = 250 in Ubuntu on a modern PC takes about
12 ms.  This results in over 800 ms of spurious system resume delay on
systems such as the Dell XPS-13-9300, which use ASL Sleep(5ms) in a
tight loop.

Address this by using usleep_range() in acpi_os_sleep() instead of
msleep().  For short sleep times this is a no brainer, but even for
long sleeps usleep_range() should be preferred because timer wheel
timers are optimized for cancelation before they expire and this
particular timer is not going to be canceled.

Add at least 50 us on top of the requested sleep time in case the
timer can be subject to coalescing, which is consistent with what's
done in user space in this context [2], but for sleeps longer than 5 ms
use 1% of the requested sleep time for this purpose.

The rationale here is that longer sleeps don't need that much of a timer
precision as a rule and making the timer a more likely candidate for
coalescing in these cases is generally desirable.  It starts at 5 ms so
that the delta between the requested sleep time and the effective
deadline is a contiuous function of the former.
