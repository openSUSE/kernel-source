Subject: [PATCH] drm/sched: memset() 'job' in drm_sched_job_init()

References: stable-fixes

drm_sched_job_init() has no control over how users allocate struct
drm_sched_job. Unfortunately, the function can also not set some struct
members such as job->sched.

This could theoretically lead to UB by users dereferencing the struct's
pointer members too early.

It is easier to debug such issues if these pointers are initialized to
NULL, so dereferencing them causes a NULL pointer exception.
Accordingly, drm_sched_entity_init() does precisely that and initializes
its struct with memset().

Initialize parameter "job" to 0 in drm_sched_job_init().
