Subject: [PATCH] xen: use correct end address of kernel for conflict checking
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

When running as a Xen PV dom0 the kernel is loaded by the hypervisor
using a different memory map than that of the host. In order to
minimize the required changes in the kernel, the kernel adapts its
memory map to that of the host. In order to do that it is checking
for conflicts of its load address with the host memory map.

Unfortunately the tested memory range does not include the .brk
area, which might result in crashes or memory corruption when this
area does conflict with the memory map of the host.

Fix the test by using the _end label instead of __bss_stop.

Fixes: 808fdb71936c ("xen: check for kernel memory conflicting with memory layout")
