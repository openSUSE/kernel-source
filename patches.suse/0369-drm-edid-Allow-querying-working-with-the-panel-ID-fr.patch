Subject: drm/edid: Allow querying/working with the panel ID from the EDID
Git-commit: d9f91a10c3e8b8b6f6762e35f2905a8914ca309d
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

EDIDs have 32-bits worth of data which is intended to be used to
uniquely identify the make/model of a panel. This has historically
been used only internally in the EDID processing code to identify
quirks with panels.

We'd like to use this panel ID in panel drivers to identify which
panel is hooked up and from that information figure out power sequence
timings. Let's expose this information from the EDID code and also
allow it to be accessed early, before a connector has been created.

To make matching in the panel drivers code easier, we'll return the
panel ID as a 32-bit value. We'll provide some functions for
converting this value back and forth to something more human readable.

+ * drm_edid_get_panel_id - Get a panel's ID through DDC
+ * @adapter: I2C adapter to use for DDC
+ *
+ * This function reads the first block of the EDID of a panel and (assuming
+ * that the EDID is valid) extracts the ID out of it. The ID is a 32-bit value
+ * (16 bits of manufacturer ID and 16 bits of per-manufacturer ID) that's
+ * supposed to be different for each different modem of panel.
+ *
+ * This function is intended to be used during early probing on devices where
+ * more than one panel might be present. Because of its intended use it must
+ * assume that the EDID of the panel is correct, at least as far as the ID
+ * is concerned (in other words, we don't process any overrides here).
+ *
+ * NOTE: it's expected that this function and drm_do_get_edid() will both
+ * be read the EDID, but there is no caching between them. Since we're only
+ * reading the first block, hopefully this extra overhead won't be too big.
+ *
+ * Return: A 32-bit ID that should be different for each make/model of panel.
