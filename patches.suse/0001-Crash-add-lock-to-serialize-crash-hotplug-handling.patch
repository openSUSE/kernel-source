Subject: [PATCH] Crash: add lock to serialize crash hotplug handling
Git-commit: e2a8f20dd8e9df695f736e51cd9115ae55be92d1
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc4
References: jsc-PED#5077

Eric reported that handling corresponding crash hotplug event can be
failed easily when many memory hotplug event are notified in a short
period.  They failed because failing to take __kexec_lock.

=======

The memory hotplug events are notified very quickly and very many, while
the handling of crash hotplug is much slower relatively.  So the atomic
variable __kexec_lock and kexec_trylock() can't guarantee the
serialization of crash hotplug handling.

Here, add a new mutex lock __crash_hotplug_lock to serialize crash hotplug
handling specifically.  This doesn't impact the usage of __kexec_lock.
