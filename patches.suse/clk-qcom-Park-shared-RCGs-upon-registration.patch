There's two problems with shared RCGs.

The first problem is that they incorrectly report the parent after
commit 703db1f5da1e ("clk: qcom: rcg2: Cache CFG register updates for
parked RCGs"). That's because the cached CFG register value needs to be
populated when the clk is registered. clk_rcg2_shared_enable() writes
the cached CFG register value 'parked_cfg'. This value is initially zero
due to static initializers. If a driver calls clk_enable() before
setting a rate or parent, it will set the parent to '0' which is
(almost?) always XO, and may not reflect the parent at registration. In
the worst case, this switches the RCG from sourcing a fast PLL to the
slow crystal speed.

The second problem is that the force enable bit isn't cleared. The force
enable bit is only used during parking and unparking of shared RCGs.
Otherwise it shouldn't be set because it keeps the RCG enabled even when
all the branches on the output of the RCG are disabled (the hardware has
a feedback mechanism so that any child branches keep the RCG enabled
when the branch enable bit is set). This problem wastes power if the clk
is unused, and is harmful in the case that the clk framework disables
the parent of the force enabled RCG. In the latter case, the GDSC the
shared RCG is associated with will get wedged if the RCG's source clk is
disabled and the GDSC tries to enable the RCG to do "housekeeping" while
powering on.

Both of these problems combined with incorrect runtime PM usage in the
display driver lead to a black screen on Qualcomm sc7180 Trogdor
chromebooks. What happens is that the bootloader leaves the
'disp_cc_mdss_rot_clk' enabled and the 'disp_cc_mdss_rot_clk_src' force
enabled and parented to 'disp_cc_pll0'. The mdss driver probes and
runtime suspends, disabling the mdss_gdsc which uses the
'disp_cc_mdss_rot_clk_src' for "housekeeping". The
'disp_cc_mdss_rot_clk' is disabled during late init because the clk is
unused, but the parent 'disp_cc_mdss_rot_clk_src' is still force enabled
because the force enable bit was never cleared. Then 'disp_cc_pll0' is
disabled because it is also unused. That's because the clk framework
believes the parent of the RCG is XO when it isn't. A child device of
the mdss device (e.g. DSI) runtime resumes mdss which powers on the
mdss_gdsc. This wedges the GDSC because 'disp_cc_mdss_rot_clk_src' is
parented to 'disp_cc_pll0' and that PLL is off. With the GDSC wedged,
mdss_runtime_resume() tries to enable 'disp_cc_mdss_mdp_clk' but it
can't because the GDSC has wedged all the clks associated with the GDSC
causing clks to stay stuck off.

This leads to the following warning seen at boot and a black screen
because the display driver fails to probe.

Fix these problems by parking shared RCGs at boot. This will properly
initialize the parked_cfg struct member so that the parent is reported
properly and ensure that the clk won't get stuck on or off because the
RCG is parented to the safe source (XO).
