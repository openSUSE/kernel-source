Subject: [PATCH] mtd: spear_smi: Fix Write Burst mode
Git-commit: 69c7f4618c16b4678f8a4949b6bb5ace259c0033
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: git-fixes bnc#1151927 5.3.17

Any write with either dd or flashcp to a device driven by the
spear_smi.c driver will pass through the spear_smi_cpy_toio()
function. This function will get called for chunks of up to 256 bytes.
If the amount of data is smaller, we may have a problem if the data
length is not 4-byte aligned. In this situation, the kernel panics
during the memcpy:

    # dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1001 count=1 of=/dev/mtd6
    spear_smi_cpy_toio [620] dest c9070000, src c7be8800, len 256
    spear_smi_cpy_toio [620] dest c9070100, src c7be8900, len 256
    spear_smi_cpy_toio [620] dest c9070200, src c7be8a00, len 256
    spear_smi_cpy_toio [620] dest c9070300, src c7be8b00, len 233
    Unhandled fault: external abort on non-linefetch (0x808) at 0xc90703e8
    [...]
    PC is at memcpy+0xcc/0x330

The above error occurs because the implementation of memcpy_toio()
tries to optimize the number of I/O by writing 4 bytes at a time as
much as possible, until there are less than 4 bytes left and then
switches to word or byte writes.

Unfortunately, the specification states about the Write Burst mode:

        "the next AHB Write request should point to the next
	incremented address and should have the same size (byte,
	half-word or word)"

This means ARM architecture implementation of memcpy_toio() cannot
reliably be used blindly here. Workaround this situation by update the
write path to stick to byte access when the burst length is not
multiple of 4.
