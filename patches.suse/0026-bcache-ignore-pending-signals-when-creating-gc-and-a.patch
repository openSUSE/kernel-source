Subject: [PATCH] bcache: ignore pending signals when creating gc and allocator
 thread
Git-commit: 0b96da639a4874311e9b5156405f69ef9fc3bef8
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc2
References: bsc#1163762, bsc#1112504

When run a cache set, all the bcache btree node of this cache set will
be checked by bch_btree_check(). If the bcache btree is very large,
iterating all the btree nodes will occupy too much system memory and
the bcache registering process might be selected and killed by system
OOM killer. kthread_run() will fail if current process has pending
signal, therefore the kthread creating in run_cache_set() for gc and
allocator kernel threads are very probably failed for a very large
bcache btree.

Indeed such OOM is safe and the registering process will exit after
the registration done. Therefore this patch flushes pending signals
during the cache set start up, specificly in bch_cache_allocator_start()
and bch_gc_thread_start(), to make sure run_cache_set() won't fail for
large cahced data set.
