Subject: [PATCH] arm64: Discard .note.GNU-stack section
Patch-mainline: Never, SUSE specific
References: bsc#1203693

Commit "Makefile: link with -z noexecstack --no-warn-rwx-segments: ddbd47d2219a"
creates a new section .note.GNU-stack, which is not discarded by arm64.
This changes the ELF layout and causes the build to fail on arm64.

Quoting Michal Matz:

 "The .note.GNU-stack section in head.o is created by 'ld -r -z noexecstack',
  when relinking head.o into head.o (for various reasons).  That section is created
  with SHT_PROGBITS, and as the kernel linker script doesn't discard those
  it also makes the output ".notes" section (which
  collects all .note* sections) SHT_PROGBITS, which in turn makes ld not generate
  a PT_NOTE segment covering all these.

  Now, I initially thought the linker with 'ld -r', when generating a
  .note.GNU-stack section because of a command line option should simply create it
  with the type SHT_NOTE and all would be well.  That somewhat works, but is actually
  wrong: a SHT_NOTE section has a specific layout per the gABI (at least
  it must contain a header), but .note.GNU-stack is empty.  So it really can't
  be SHT_NOTE but must remain either SHT_PROGBITS or SHT_NOBITS."

Fix it for now by discarding that section.
