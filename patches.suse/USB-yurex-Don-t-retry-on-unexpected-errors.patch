Subject: USB: yurex: Don't retry on unexpected errors
Git-commit: 32a0721c6620b77504916dac0cea8ad497c4878a
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc3
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.7

According to Greg KH, it has been generally agreed that when a USB
driver encounters an unknown error (or one it can't handle directly),
it should just give up instead of going into a potentially infinite
retry loop.

The three codes -EPROTO, -EILSEQ, and -ETIME fall into this category.
They can be caused by bus errors such as packet loss or corruption,
attempting to communicate with a disconnected device, or by malicious
firmware.  Nowadays the extent of packet loss or corruption is
negligible, so it should be safe for a driver to give up whenever one
of these errors occurs.

Although the yurex driver handles -EILSEQ errors in this way, it
doesn't do the same for -EPROTO (as discovered by the syzbot fuzzer)
or other unrecognized errors.  This patch adjusts the driver so that
it doesn't log an error message for -EPROTO or -ETIME, and it doesn't
retry after any errors.
