Subject: scsi: libsas: Reset num_scatter if libata marks qc as NODATA
Git-commit: 176ddd89171ddcf661862d90c5d257877f7326d6
Patch-mainline: v5.12-rc8
References: bsc#1187068

When the cache_type for the SCSI device is changed, the SCSI layer issues a
MODE_SELECT command. The caching mode details are communicated via a
request buffer associated with the SCSI command with data direction set as
DMA_TO_DEVICE (scsi_mode_select()). When this command reaches the libata
layer, as a part of generic initial setup, libata layer sets up the
scatterlist for the command using the SCSI command (ata_scsi_qc_new()).
This command is then translated by the libata layer into
ATA_CMD_SET_FEATURES (ata_scsi_mode_select_xlat()). The libata layer treats
this as a non-data command (ata_mselect_caching()), since it only needs an
ATA taskfile to pass the caching on/off information to the device. It does
not need the scatterlist that has been setup, so it does not perform
dma_map_sg() on the scatterlist (ata_qc_issue()). Unfortunately, when this
command reaches the libsas layer (sas_ata_qc_issue()), libsas layer sees it
as a non-data command with a scatterlist. It cannot extract the correct DMA
length since the scatterlist has not been mapped with dma_map_sg() for a
DMA operation. When this partially constructed SAS task reaches pm80xx
LLDD, it results in the following warning:

"pm80xx_chip_sata_req 6058: The sg list address
start_addr=0x0000000000000000 data_len=0x0end_addr_high=0xffffffff
end_addr_low=0xffffffff has crossed 4G boundary"

Update libsas to handle ATA non-data commands separately so num_scatter and
total_xfer_len remain 0.
