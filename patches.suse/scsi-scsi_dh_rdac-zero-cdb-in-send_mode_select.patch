Subject: scsi: scsi_dh_rdac: zero cdb in send_mode_select()
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
Git-commit: 57adf5d4cfd3198aa480e7c94a101fc8c4e6109d
References: bsc#1149313 bnc#1151927 5.3.4

cdb in send_mode_select() is not zeroed and is only partially filled in
rdac_failover_get(), which leads to some random data getting to the
device. Users have reported storage responding to such commands with
INVALID FIELD IN CDB. Code before commit 327825574132 was not affected, as
it called blk_rq_set_block_pc().

Fix this by zeroing out the cdb first.

Identified & fix proposed by HPE.

Fixes: 327825574132 ("scsi_dh_rdac: switch to scsi_execute_req_flags()")
