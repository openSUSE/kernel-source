Subject: [PATCH] hwmon: mlxreg-fan: Prevent fans from getting stuck at 0 RPM
Git-commit: 1180c79fbf36e4c02e76ae4658509523437e52a4
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc5
References: git-fixes

The fans controlled by the driver can get stuck at 0 RPM if they are
configured below a 20% duty cycle. The driver tries to avoid this by
enforcing a minimum duty cycle of 20%, but this is done after the fans
are registered with the thermal subsystem. This is too late as the
thermal subsystem can set their current state before the driver is able
to enforce the minimum duty cycle.

Fix by setting the minimum duty cycle before registering the fans with
the thermal subsystem.
