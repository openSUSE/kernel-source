Subject: x86/amd_nb: Check for invalid SMN reads
Git-commit: c625dabbf1c4a8e77e4734014f2fde7aa9071a1f
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc3
References: git-fixes

AMD Zen-based systems use a System Management Network (SMN) that
provides access to implementation-specific registers.

SMN accesses are done indirectly through an index/data pair in PCI
config space. The PCI config access may fail and return an error code.
This would prevent the "read" value from being updated.

However, the PCI config access may succeed, but the return value may be
invalid. This is in similar fashion to PCI bad reads, i.e. return all
bits set.

Most systems will return 0 for SMN addresses that are not accessible.
This is in line with AMD convention that unavailable registers are
Read-as-Zero/Writes-Ignored.

However, some systems will return a "PCI Error Response" instead. This
value, along with an error code of 0 from the PCI config access, will
confuse callers of the amd_smn_read() function.

Check for this condition, clear the return value, and set a proper error
code.
