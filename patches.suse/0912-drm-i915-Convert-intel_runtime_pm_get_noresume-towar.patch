Subject: drm/i915: Convert intel_runtime_pm_get_noresume towards raw wakeref
MIME-Version: 1.0

Git-commit: 7af6b116261c12b37674ac4639e23e9df9b09fb3
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc1
References: jsc#PED-9898 jsc#PED-10191 jsc#PED-10197 jsc#PED-10226 jsc#PED-10237 jsc#PED-10340 jsc#PED-10852 jsc#PED-11022

In the past, the noresume function was used by the GEM code to ensure
wakelocks were held and bump its usage. This is no longer the case
and this function was totally unused until it started to be used again
by display with commit 77e619a82fc3 ("drm/i915/display: convert inner
wakeref get towards get_if_in_use")

However, on the display code, most of the callers are using the
raw wakeref, rather then the wakelock version. What caused a
major regression caught by CI.

Another option to this patch is to go with the original plan and
use the get_if_in_use variant in the display code, what is enough
to fulfil our needs. Then, an extra patch to delete the unused
_noresume variant.

v2: Keep grabbing wakelock but only assert for wakeref. (Imre)
