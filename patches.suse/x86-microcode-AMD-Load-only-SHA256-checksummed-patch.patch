From 50cef76d5cb0e199cda19f026842560f6eedc4f7 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: "Borislav Petkov (AMD)" <bp@alien8.de>
Date: Thu, 23 Jan 2025 14:44:53 +0100
Subject: [PATCH] x86/microcode/AMD: Load only SHA256-checksummed patches
Git-commit: 50cef76d5cb0e199cda19f026842560f6eedc4f7
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc6
References: bsc#1256528

Load patches for which the driver carries a SHA256 checksum of the patch
blob.

This can be disabled by adding "microcode.amd_sha_check=off" on the
kernel cmdline. But it is highly NOT recommended.
