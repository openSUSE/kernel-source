Subject: xen: avoid crash in disable_hotplug_cpu
Patch-mainline: never, different patch required
References: bsc#1106594

The command 'xl vcpu-set 0 0', issued in dom0, will crash dom0:

BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 00000000000002d8
RIP: e030:device_offline+0x9/0xb0
Call Trace:
 handle_vcpu_hotplug_event+0xb5/0xc0

This happens because handle_vcpu_hotplug_event is called twice. In the
first iteration cpu_present is still true, in the second iteration
cpu_present is false which causes get_cpu_device to return NULL.
In case of cpu#0, cpu_online is apparently always true.

Fix this crash by checking if the cpu was actually offlined by
device_offline, otherwise leave the cpu_present state as it is.
