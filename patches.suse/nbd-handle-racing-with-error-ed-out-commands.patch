We hit the following warning in production

This was preceded by us timing out everything and shutting down the
sockets for the device.  The problem is we had a request in the queue at
the same time, so we completed the request twice.  This can actually
happen in a lot of cases, we fail to get a ref on our config, we only
have one connection and just error out the command, etc.

Fix this by checking cmd->status in nbd_read_stat.  We only change this
under the cmd->lock, so we are safe to check this here and see if we've
already error'ed this command out, which would indicate that we've
completed it as well.
