Subject: drm: Remove references to removed transitional helpers
Git-commit: 81ed7d737621ff91571daea8fbf277e187e3a207
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc1
References: drm-backport-placeholder jsc#PED-3527 jsc#PED-5475 jsc#PED-6068 jsc#PED-6070 jsc#PED-6116 jsc#PED-6120 jsc#PED-5065 jsc#PED-5477 jsc#PED-5511 jsc#PED-6041 jsc#PED-6069 jsc#PED-6071

The transitional helpers were removed a long time ago, but some
references stuck.  Remove them.

- * The second part also implements transitional helpers which allow drivers to

  * The plane helpers share the function table structures with other helpers,
