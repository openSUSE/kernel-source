Subject: tcp: remove 64 KByte limit for initial tp->rcv_wnd value
Git-commit: 378979e94e953c2070acb4f0e0c98d29260bd09d
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc1

Recently, we had some servers upgraded to the latest kernel and noticed
the indicator from the user side showed worse results than before. It is
caused by the limitation of tp->rcv_wnd.

In 2018 commit a337531b942b ("tcp: up initial rmem to 128KB and SYN rwin
to around 64KB") limited the initial value of tp->rcv_wnd to 65535, most
CDN teams would not benefit from this change because they cannot have a
large window to receive a big packet, which will be slowed down especially
in long RTT. Small rcv_wnd means slow transfer speed, to some extent. It's
the side effect for the latency/time-sensitive users.

To avoid future confusion, current change doesn't affect the initial
receive window on the wire in a SYN or SYN+ACK packet which are set within
65535 bytes according to RFC 7323 also due to the limit in
__tcp_transmit_skb(): 

    th->window      = htons(min(tp->rcv_wnd, 65535U));

In one word, __tcp_transmit_skb() already ensures that constraint is
respected, no matter how large tp->rcv_wnd is. The change doesn't violate
RFC.

Let me provide one example if with or without the patch:
Before: 
client   --- SYN: rwindow=65535 ---> server
client   <--- SYN+ACK: rwindow=65535 ----  server
client   --- ACK: rwindow=65536 ---> server
Note: for the last ACK, the calculation is 512 << 7.

After: 
client   --- SYN: rwindow=65535 ---> server
client   <--- SYN+ACK: rwindow=65535 ----  server
client   --- ACK: rwindow=175232 ---> server
Note: I use the following command to make it work:
ip route change default via [ip] dev eth0 metric 100 initrwnd 120
For the last ACK, the calculation is 1369 << 7.

When we apply such a patch, having a large rcv_wnd if the user tweak this
knob can help transfer data more rapidly and save some rtts.
