Subject: [PATCH] net: phy: Don't trigger state machine while in suspend
Git-commit: 1758bde2e4aa5ff188d53e7d9d388bbb7e12eebb
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc5
References: git-fixes

Upon system sleep, mdio_bus_phy_suspend() stops the phy_state_machine(),
but subsequent interrupts may retrigger it:

They may have been left enabled to facilitate wakeup and are not
quiesced until the ->suspend_noirq() phase.  Unwanted interrupts may
hence occur between mdio_bus_phy_suspend() and dpm_suspend_noirq(),
as well as between dpm_resume_noirq() and mdio_bus_phy_resume().

Retriggering the phy_state_machine() through an interrupt is not only
undesirable for the reason given in mdio_bus_phy_suspend() (freezing it
midway with phydev->lock held), but also because the PHY may be
inaccessible after it's suspended:  Accesses to USB-attached PHYs are
blocked once usb_suspend_both() clears the can_submit flag and PHYs on
PCI network cards may become inaccessible upon suspend as well.

Amend phy_interrupt() to avoid triggering the state machine if the PHY
is suspended.  Signal wakeup instead if the attached net_device or its
parent has been configured as a wakeup source.  (Those conditions are
identical to mdio_bus_phy_may_suspend().)  Postpone handling of the
interrupt until the PHY has resumed.

Before stopping the phy_state_machine() in mdio_bus_phy_suspend(),
wait for a concurrent phy_interrupt() to run to completion.  That is
necessary because phy_interrupt() may have checked the PHY's suspend
status before the system sleep transition commenced and it may thus
retrigger the state machine after it was stopped.

Likewise, after re-enabling interrupt handling in mdio_bus_phy_resume(),
wait for a concurrent phy_interrupt() to complete to ensure that
interrupts which it postponed are properly rerun.

The issue was exposed by commit 1ce8b37241ed ("usbnet: smsc95xx: Forward
PHY interrupts to PHY driver to avoid polling"), but has existed since
forever.
