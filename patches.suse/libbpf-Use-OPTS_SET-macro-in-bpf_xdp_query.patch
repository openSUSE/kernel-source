Subject: libbpf: Use OPTS_SET() macro in bpf_xdp_query()
MIME-Version: 1.0

Git-commit: 92a871ab9fa59a74d013bc04f321026a057618e7
References: git-fixes CVE-2024-27050 bsc#1223767

When the feature_flags and xdp_zc_max_segs fields were added to the libbpf
bpf_xdp_query_opts, the code writing them did not use the OPTS_SET() macro.
This causes libbpf to write to those fields unconditionally, which means
that programs compiled against an older version of libbpf (with a smaller
size of the bpf_xdp_query_opts struct) will have its stack corrupted by
libbpf writing out of bounds.

The patch adding the feature_flags field has an early bail out if the
feature_flags field is not part of the opts struct (via the OPTS_HAS)
macro, but the patch adding xdp_zc_max_segs does not. For consistency, this
fix just changes the assignments to both fields to use the OPTS_SET()
macro.
