Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: only compute port params in specific stream states
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Git-commit: 62ada17a6217a50fbd1b23f10899890f56effc97
Patch-mainline: v6.16-rc1
References: jsc#PED-14430 jsc#PED-14297 jsc#PED-14024

Currently, sdw_compute_master_ports() is blindly called for every single
Manager runtime. However, we should not take into account the stream's
bandwidth if the stream is just allocated or already deprepared.
