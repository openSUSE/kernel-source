Subject: [PATCH for v6.3 regression] mm/mremap: fix vm_pgoff in vma_merge() case 3
Patch-mainline: Submitted, https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230427140959.27655-1-vbabka@suse.cz/
References: bsc#1210903

After upgrading build guests to v6.3, rpm started segfaulting for
specific packages, which was bisected to commit 0503ea8f5ba7 ("mm/mmap:
remove __vma_adjust()"). rpm is doing many mremap() operations with file
mappings of its db. The problem is that in vma_merge() case 3 (we merge
with the next vma, expanding it downwards) vm_pgoff is not adjusted as
it should when vm_start changes. As a result the rpm process most likely
sees data from the wrong offset of the file. Fix the vm_pgoff
calculation.

For case 8 this is a non-functional change as the resulting vm_pgoff is
the same.

Hi, I'm sending this patch on top of v6.3 as I think it should be
applied and backported to 6.3-stable rather sooner than later.
This means there would be a small conflict when merging mm/mm-stable
later. Alternatively it could be added to mm/mm-stable and upcoming 6.4
pull request, but then the stable backport would need adjustment.
It's up to Linus and Andrew.
