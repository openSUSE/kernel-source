Subject: [PATCH] sched/core: Prevent rescheduling when interrupts are disabled
Git-commit: 82c387ef7568c0d96a918a5a78d9cad6256cfa15
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc5
References: bsc#1240324 CVE-2024-58090

David reported a warning observed while loop testing kexec jump:

  Interrupts enabled after irqrouter_resume+0x0/0x50
  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 560 at drivers/base/syscore.c:103 syscore_resume+0x18a/0x220
   kernel_kexec+0xf6/0x180
   __do_sys_reboot+0x206/0x250
   do_syscall_64+0x95/0x180

The corresponding interrupt flag trace:

  hardirqs last  enabled at (15573): [<ffffffffa8281b8e>] __up_console_sem+0x7e/0x90
  hardirqs last disabled at (15580): [<ffffffffa8281b73>] __up_console_sem+0x63/0x90

That means __up_console_sem() was invoked with interrupts enabled. Further
instrumentation revealed that in the interrupt disabled section of kexec
jump one of the syscore_suspend() callbacks woke up a task, which set the
NEED_RESCHED flag. A later callback in the resume path invoked
cond_resched() which in turn led to the invocation of the scheduler:

  __cond_resched+0x21/0x60
  down_timeout+0x18/0x60
  acpi_os_wait_semaphore+0x4c/0x80
  acpi_ut_acquire_mutex+0x3d/0x100
  acpi_ns_get_node+0x27/0x60
  acpi_ns_evaluate+0x1cb/0x2d0
  acpi_rs_set_srs_method_data+0x156/0x190
  acpi_pci_link_set+0x11c/0x290
  irqrouter_resume+0x54/0x60
  syscore_resume+0x6a/0x200
  kernel_kexec+0x145/0x1c0
  __do_sys_reboot+0xeb/0x240
  do_syscall_64+0x95/0x180

This is a long standing problem, which probably got more visible with
the recent printk changes. Something does a task wakeup and the
scheduler sets the NEED_RESCHED flag. cond_resched() sees it set and
invokes schedule() from a completely bogus context. The scheduler
enables interrupts after context switching, which causes the above
warning at the end.

Quite some of the code paths in syscore_suspend()/resume() can result in
triggering a wakeup with the exactly same consequences. They might not
have done so yet, but as they share a lot of code with normal operations
it's just a question of time.

The problem only affects the PREEMPT_NONE and PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY scheduling
models. Full preemption is not affected as cond_resched() is disabled and
the preemption check preemptible() takes the interrupt disabled flag into
account.

Cure the problem by adding a corresponding check into cond_resched().
