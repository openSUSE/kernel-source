Subject: [PATCH] media: tc358743: fix possible use-after-free in tc358743_remove()
Git-commit: 6107a4fdf8554a7aa9488bdc835bb010062fa8a9
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc1
References: git-fixes

This driver's remove path calls cancel_delayed_work(). However, that
function does not wait until the work function finishes. This means
that the callback function may still be running after the driver's
remove function has finished, which would result in a use-after-free.

Fix by calling cancel_delayed_work_sync(), which ensures that
the work is properly cancelled, no longer running, and unable
to re-schedule itself.
