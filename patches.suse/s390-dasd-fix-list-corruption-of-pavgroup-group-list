Subject: s390/dasd: fix list corruption of pavgroup group list
Git-commit: 0ede91f83aa335da1c3ec68eb0f9e228f269f6d8
Patch-mainline: v5.11-rc1
References: git-fixes

dasd_alias_add_device() moves devices to the active_devices list in case
of a scheduled LCU update regardless if they have previously been in a
pavgroup or not.

Example: device A and B are in the same pavgroup.

Device A has already been in a pavgroup and the private->pavgroup pointer
is set and points to a valid pavgroup. While going through dasd_add_device
it is moved from the pavgroup to the active_devices list.

In parallel device B might be removed from the same pavgroup in
remove_device_from_lcu() which in turn checks if the group is empty
and deletes it accordingly because device A has already been removed from
there.

When now device A enters remove_device_from_lcu() it is tried to remove it
from the pavgroup again because the pavgroup pointer is still set and again
the empty group will be cleaned up which leads to a list corruption.

Fix by setting private->pavgroup to NULL in dasd_add_device.

If the device has been the last device on the pavgroup an empty pavgroup
remains but this will be cleaned up by the scheduled lcu_update which
iterates over all existing pavgroups.
