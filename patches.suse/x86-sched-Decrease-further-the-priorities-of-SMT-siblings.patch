Subject: [PATCH] x86/sched: Decrease further the priorities of SMT siblings

References: jsc#SLE-18889
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
Git-commit: 183b8ec38f1ec6c1f8419375303bf1d09a2b8369

When scheduling, it is better to prefer a separate physical core rather
than the SMT sibling of a high priority core. The existing formula to
compute priorities takes such fact in consideration. There may exist,
however, combinations of priorities (i.e., maximum frequencies) in which
the priority of high-numbered SMT siblings of high-priority cores collides
with the priority of low-numbered SMT siblings of low-priority cores.

Consider for instance an SMT2 system with CPUs [0, 1] with priority 60 and
[2, 3] with priority 30(CPUs in brackets are SMT siblings. In such a case,
the resulting priorities would be [120, 60], [60, 30]. Thus, to ensure
that CPU2 has higher priority than CPU1, divide the raw priority by the
squared SMT iterator. The resulting priorities are [120, 30]. [60, 15].
