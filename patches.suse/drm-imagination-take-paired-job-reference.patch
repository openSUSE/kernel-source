Subject: [PATCH] drm/imagination: take paired job reference
Git-commit: 4ba2abe154ef68f9612eee9d6fbfe53a1736b064
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc2
References: git-fixes CVE-2025-37763 bsc#1242508

For paired jobs, have the fragment job take a reference on the
geometry job, so that the geometry job cannot be freed until
the fragment job has finished with it.

The geometry job structure is accessed when the fragment job is being
prepared by the GPU scheduler. Taking the reference prevents the
geometry job being freed until the fragment job no longer requires it.

Fixes a use after free bug detected by KASAN:
