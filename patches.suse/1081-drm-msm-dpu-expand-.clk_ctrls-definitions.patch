Subject: drm/msm/dpu: expand .clk_ctrls definitions
Git-commit: 25c6ae11a63d7f38bbccc024bffe7f767e2ec2c9
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc1
References: drm-backport-placeholder jsc#PED-3527 jsc#PED-5475 jsc#PED-6068 jsc#PED-6070 jsc#PED-6116 jsc#PED-6120 jsc#PED-5065 jsc#PED-5477 jsc#PED-5511 jsc#PED-6041 jsc#PED-6069 jsc#PED-6071

Use more standard initialisation for .clk_ctrls definitions. Define a
single .clk_ctrls field and use array init inside.
