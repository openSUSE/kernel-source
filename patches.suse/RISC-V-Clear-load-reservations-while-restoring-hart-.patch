Subject: RISC-V: Clear load reservations while restoring hart contexts
Git-commit: 18856604b3e7090ce42d533995173ee70c24b1c9
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc2
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.8

This is almost entirely a comment.  The bug is unlikely to manifest on
existing hardware because there is a timeout on load reservations, but
manifests on QEMU because there is no timeout.
