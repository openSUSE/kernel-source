Subject: [PATCH] dlm: fix error if inactive rsb is not hashed
Git-commit: 94e6e889a786dd16542fc8f2a45405fa13e3bbb5
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc1
References: git-fixes

If an inactive rsb is not hashed anymore and this could occur because we
releases and acquired locks we need to signal the followed code that the
lookup failed. Since the lookup was successful, but it isn't part of the
rsb hash anymore we need to signal it by setting error to -EBADR as
dlm_search_rsb_tree() does it.
