Subject: tracing: Do no increment trace_clock_global() by one
Git-commit: 89529d8b8f8daf92d9979382b8d2eb39966846ea
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc7
References: git-fixes

The trace_clock_global() tries to make sure the events between CPUs is
somewhat in order. A global value is used and updated by the latest read
of a clock. If one CPU is ahead by a little, and is read by another CPU, a
lock is taken, and if the timestamp of the other CPU is behind, it will
simply use the other CPUs timestamp.

The lock is also only taken with a "trylock" due to tracing, and strange
recursions can happen. The lock is not taken at all in NMI context.

In the case where the lock is not able to be taken, the non synced
timestamp is returned. But it will not be less than the saved global
timestamp.

The problem arises because when the time goes "backwards" the time
returned is the saved timestamp plus 1. If the lock is not taken, and the
plus one to the timestamp is returned, there's a small race that can cause
the time to go backwards!

	CPU0				CPU1
	----				----
				trace_clock_global() {
				    ts = clock() [ 1000 ]
				    trylock(clock_lock) [ success ]
				    global_ts = ts; [ 1000 ]

				    <interrupted by NMI>
 trace_clock_global() {
    ts = clock() [ 999 ]
    if (ts < global_ts)
	ts = global_ts + 1 [ 1001 ]

    trylock(clock_lock) [ fail ]

    return ts [ 1001]
 }
				    unlock(clock_lock);
				    return ts; [ 1000 ]
				}

 trace_clock_global() {
    ts = clock() [ 1000 ]
    if (ts < global_ts) [ false 1000 == 1000 ]

    trylock(clock_lock) [ success ]
    global_ts = ts; [ 1000 ]
    unlock(clock_lock)

    return ts; [ 1000 ]
 }

The above case shows to reads of trace_clock_global() on the same CPU, but
the second read returns one less than the first read. That is, time when
backwards, and this is not what is allowed by trace_clock_global().

This was triggered by heavy tracing and the ring buffer checker that tests
for the clock going backwards:

 Ring buffer clock went backwards: 20613921464 -> 20613921463

This happened more than once, and always for an off by one result. It also
started happening after commit aafe104aa9096 was added.
