Subject: x86/speculation: Fill RSB on vmexit for IBRS
Git-commit: 9756bba28470722dacb79ffce554336dd1f6a6cd
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc7
References: bsc#1199657 CVE-2022-29900 CVE-2022-29901 CVE-2022-49611 bsc#1238618

Prevent RSB underflow/poisoning attacks with RSB.  While at it, add a
bunch of comments to attempt to document the current state of tribal
knowledge about RSB attacks and what exactly is being mitigated.

+	 *    Some Intel parts have "bottomless RSB".  When the RSB is empty,
+	 *    speculated return targets may come from the branch predictor,
+	 *    which could have a user-poisoned BTB or BHB entry.
+	 *
+	 *    AMD has it even worse: *all* returns are speculated from the BTB,
+	 *    regardless of the state of the RSB.
+	 *
+	 *    When IBRS or eIBRS is enabled, the "user -> kernel" attack
+	 *    scenario is mitigated by the IBRS branch prediction isolation
+	 *    properties, so the RSB buffer filling wouldn't be necessary to
+	 *    protect against this type of attack.
+	 *
+	 *    The "user -> user" attack scenario is mitigated by RSB filling.
+	 *
+	 * 2) Poisoned RSB entry
+	 *
+	 *    If the 'next' in-kernel return stack is shorter than 'prev',
+	 *    'next' could be tricked into speculating with a user-poisoned RSB
+	 *    entry.
+	 *
+	 *    The "user -> kernel" attack scenario is mitigated by SMEP and
+	 *    eIBRS.
+	 *
+	 *    The "user -> user" scenario, also known as SpectreBHB, requires
+	 *    RSB clearing.

+	 * switches.
