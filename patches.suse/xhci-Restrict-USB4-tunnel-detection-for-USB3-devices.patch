Subject: [PATCH] xhci: Restrict USB4 tunnel detection for USB3 devices to Intel hosts
Git-commit: 487cfd4a8e3dc42d34a759017978a4edaf85fce0
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc6
References: git-fixes

When adding support for USB3-over-USB4 tunnelling detection, a check
for an Intel-specific capability was added. This capability, which
goes by ID 206, is used without any check that we are actually
dealing with an Intel host.

As it turns out, the Cadence XHCI controller *also* exposes an
extended capability numbered 206 (for unknown purposes), but of
course doesn't have the Intel-specific registers that the tunnelling
code is trying to access. Fun follows.

The core of the problems is that the tunnelling code blindly uses
vendor-specific capabilities without any check (the Intel-provided
documentation I have at hand indicates that 192-255 are indeed
vendor-specific).

Restrict the detection code to Intel HW for real, preventing any
further explosion on my (non-Intel) HW.
