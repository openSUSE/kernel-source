Subject: zram: clear IDLE flag after recompression
Git-commit: f85219096648b251a81e9fe24a1974590cfc417d
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
References: git-fixes

Patch series "zram: IDLE flag handling fixes", v2.

zram can wrongly preserve ZRAM_IDLE flag on its entries which can result
in premature post-processing (writeback and recompression) of such
entries.

This patch (of 2)

Recompression should clear ZRAM_IDLE flag on the entries it has accessed,
because otherwise some entries, specifically those for which recompression
has failed, become immediate candidate entries for another post-processing
(e.g.  writeback).

Consider the following case:
- recompression marks entries IDLE every 4 hours and attempts
  to recompress them
- some entries are incompressible, so we keep them intact and
  hence preserve IDLE flag
- writeback marks entries IDLE every 8 hours and writebacks
  IDLE entries, however we have IDLE entries left from
  recompression, so writeback prematurely writebacks those
  entries.

The bug was reported by Shin Kawamura.
