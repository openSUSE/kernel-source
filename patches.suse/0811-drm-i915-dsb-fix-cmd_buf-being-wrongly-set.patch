Subject: drm/i915/dsb: fix cmd_buf being wrongly set
Git-commit: 13caf7bea4432e8d192d412eae9ee8efb2f47fe8
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-12680, jsc#SLE-12880, jsc#SLE-12882, jsc#SLE-12883, jsc#SLE-13496, jsc#SLE-15322

The "err" label is not really "err", but rather "out" since the return
path is shared between error condition and normal path. This broke when
commit 03cea61076f0 ("drm/i915/dsb: fix extra warning on error path
handling") added a "dsb->cmd_buf = NULL;" there, making DSB to stop
working since now all writes would pass-through via mmio.

Remove the set to NULL since it's actually not needed: we only set it if
all steps are successful. While at it, rename the label so this confusion
doesn't happen again.
