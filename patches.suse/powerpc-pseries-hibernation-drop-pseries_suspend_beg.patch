Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/pseries/hibernation: drop pseries_suspend_begin()
 from suspend ops

References: bsc#1181674 ltc#189159
Patch-mainline: v5.11-rc1
Git-commit: 52719fce3f4c7a8ac9eaa191e8d75a697f9fbcbc

There are three ways pseries_suspend_begin() can be reached:

1. When "mem" is written to /sys/power/state:

kobj_attr_store()
-> state_store()
  -> pm_suspend()
    -> suspend_devices_and_enter()
      -> pseries_suspend_begin()

This never works because there is no way to supply a valid stream id
using this interface, and H_VASI_STATE is called with a stream id of
zero. So this call path is useless at best.

2. When a stream id is written to /sys/devices/system/power/hibernate.
pseries_suspend_begin() is polled directly from store_hibernate()
until the stream is in the "Suspending" state (i.e. the platform is
ready for the OS to suspend execution):

dev_attr_store()
-> store_hibernate()
  -> pseries_suspend_begin()

3. When a stream id is written to /sys/devices/system/power/hibernate
(continued). After #2, pseries_suspend_begin() is called once again
from the pm core:

dev_attr_store()
-> store_hibernate()
  -> pm_suspend()
    -> suspend_devices_and_enter()
      -> pseries_suspend_begin()

This is redundant because the VASI suspend state is already known to
be Suspending.

The begin() callback of platform_suspend_ops is optional, so we can
simply remove that assignment with no loss of function.
