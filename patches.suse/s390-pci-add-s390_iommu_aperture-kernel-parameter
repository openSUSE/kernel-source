Subject: s390/pci: add s390_iommu_aperture kernel parameter
Git-commit: 6aefbf1cdf0018c5af53a3fa300a61fef0f046b6
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: bsc#1193233 LTC#195540

Some applications map the same memory area for DMA multiple times while
also mapping significant amounts of memory. With our current DMA code
these applications will run out of DMA addresses after mapping half of
the available memory because the number of DMA mappings is constrained
by the number of concurrently active DMA addresses we support which in
turn is limited by the minimum of hardware constraints and high_memory.

Limiting the number of active DMA addresses to high_memory is only
a heuristic to save memory used by the iommu_bitmap and DMA page tables
however. This was added under the assumption that it rarely makes sense
to DMA map more than system memory.

To accommodate special applications which insist on double mapping, which
works on other platforms, allow specifying a factor of how many times
installed memory is available as DMA address space. Use 0 as a special
value to apply no constraints beyond what hardware dictates at the
expense of significantly more memory use.
