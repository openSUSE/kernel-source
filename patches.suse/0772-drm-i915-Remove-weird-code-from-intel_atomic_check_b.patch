Subject: drm/i915: Remove weird code from intel_atomic_check_bigjoiner()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: 2b1466ea19182551ceffcd6deed2b22377cb2a53
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

There's some weird junk in intel_atomic_check_bigjoiner()
that's trying to look at the old crtc state's bigjoiner
usage for some reason. That code is totally unnecessary,
and maybe even actively harmful. Not entirely sure which
since it's such a mess that I can't actually wrap my brain
around what it ends up doing.

Either way, thanks to intel_bigjoiner_add_affected_crtcs()
all of the old bigjoiner crtcs are guaranteed to be in the
state already if any one of them is in the state. Also if
any one of those crtcs got flagged for a modeset, then all
of them will have been flagged, and the bigjoiner links
will have been detached via kill_bigjoiner_slave().

So there is no need to look examing any old bigjoiner
usage in intel_atomic_check_bigjoiner(). All we have to care
about is whether bigjoiner is needed for the new state,
and whether we can get the slave crtc we need.
