Subject: [PATCH] media: ipu3-cio2: allow ipu_bridge to be a module again
Git-commit: 2545a2c02ba1da9cfb9ec218623c71b00eb4a555
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc1
References: git-fixes

This code was previously part of the VIDEO_IPU3_CIO2 driver, which could
be built-in or a loadable module, but after the move it turned into a
builtin-only driver. This fails to link when the I2C subsystem is a
Module: 

X86_64-linux-ld: drivers/media/pci/intel/ipu-bridge.o: in function `ipu_bridge_unregister_sensors':
ipu-bridge.c:(.text+0x50): undefined reference to `i2c_unregister_device'
X86_64-linux-ld: drivers/media/pci/intel/ipu-bridge.o: in function `ipu_bridge_init':
ipu-bridge.c:(.text+0x9c9): undefined reference to `i2c_acpi_new_device_by_fwnode'

In general, drivers should not have to be built-in, so change the option
to a tristate with the corresponding dependency. This in turn opens a
new problem with the dependency, as the IPU bridge can be a loadable module
while the ipu3 driver itself is built-in, producing a new link failure:

86_64-linux-ld: drivers/media/pci/intel/ipu3/ipu3-cio2.o: in function `cio2_pci_probe':
ipu3-cio2.c:(.text+0x197e): undefined reference to `ipu_bridge_init'

In order to fix this, restore the old Kconfig option that controlled
the ipu bridge driver before it was split out, but make it select a
hidden symbol that now corresponds to the bridge driver.

When other drivers get added that share ipu-bridge, this should cover
all corner cases, and allow any combination of them to be built-in
or modular.
