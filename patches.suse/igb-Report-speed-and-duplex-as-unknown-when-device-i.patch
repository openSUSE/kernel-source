Subject: igb: Report speed and duplex as unknown when device is runtime
 suspended
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
Git-commit: 165ae7a8feb53dc47fb041357e4b253bfc927cf9
References: jsc#SLE-13536

igb device gets runtime suspended when there's no link partner. We can't
get correct speed under that state:
$ cat /sys/class/net/enp3s0/speed
1000

In addition to that, an error can also be spotted in dmesg:
[  385.991957] igb 0000:03:00.0 enp3s0: PCIe link lost

Since device can only be runtime suspended when there's no link partner,
we can skip reading register and let the following logic set speed and
duplex with correct status.

The more generic approach will be wrap get_link_ksettings() with begin()
and complete() callbacks. However, for this particular issue, begin()
calls igb_runtime_resume() , which tries to rtnl_lock() while the lock
is already hold by upper ethtool layer.

So let's take this approach until the igb_runtime_resume() no longer
needs to hold rtnl_lock.
