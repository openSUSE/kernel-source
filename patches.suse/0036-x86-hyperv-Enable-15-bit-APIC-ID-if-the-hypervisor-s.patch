Subject: x86/hyperv: Enable 15-bit APIC ID if the hypervisor supports it
Git-commit: d981059e13ffa9ed03a73472e932d070323bd057
Patch-mainline: v5.11-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-16823

When a Linux VM runs on Hyper-V, if the VM has CPUs with >255 APIC IDs,
the CPUs can't be the destination of IOAPIC interrupts, because the
IOAPIC RTE's Dest Field has only 8 bits. Currently the hackery driver
drivers/iommu/hyperv-iommu.c is used to ensure IOAPIC interrupts are
only routed to CPUs that don't have >255 APIC IDs. However, there is
an issue with kdump, because the kdump kernel can run on any CPU, and
hence IOAPIC interrupts can't work if the kdump kernel run on a CPU
with a >255 APIC ID.

The kdump issue can be fixed by the Extended Dest ID, which is introduced
recently by David Woodhouse (for IOAPIC, see the field virt_destid_8_14 in
struct IO_APIC_route_entry). Of course, the Extended Dest ID needs the
support of the underlying hypervisor. The latest Hyper-V has added the
support recently: with this commit, on such a Hyper-V host, Linux VM
does not use hyperv-iommu.c because hyperv_prepare_irq_remapping()
returns -ENODEV; instead, Linux kernel's generic support of Extended Dest
ID from David is used, meaning that Linux VM is able to support up to
32K CPUs, and IOAPIC interrupts can be routed to all the CPUs.

On an old Hyper-V host that doesn't support the Extended Dest ID, nothing
changes with this commit: Linux VM is still able to bring up the CPUs with
> 255 APIC IDs with the help of hyperv-iommu.c, but IOAPIC interrupts still
can not go to such CPUs, and the kdump kernel still can not work properly
on such CPUs.

[ tglx: Updated comment as suggested by David ]
