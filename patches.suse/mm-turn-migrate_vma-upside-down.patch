Subject: mm: turn migrate_vma upside down
Git-commit: a7d1f22bb74f32cf3cd93f52776007e161f1a738
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-16387

There isn't any good reason to pass callbacks to migrate_vma.  Instead
we can just export the three steps done by this function to drivers and
let them sequence the operation without callbacks.  This removes a lot
of boilerplate code as-is, and will allow the drivers to drastically
improve code flow and error handling further on.

@@ -339,58 +339,8 @@ Migration to and from device memory
 ===================================
 
 Because the CPU cannot access device memory, migration must use the device DMA
-engine to perform copy from and to device memory. For this we need a new
-migration helper::
-
- int migrate_vma(const struct migrate_vma_ops *ops,
-                 struct vm_area_struct *vma,
-                 unsigned long mentries,
-                 unsigned long start,
-                 unsigned long end,
-                 unsigned long *src,
-                 unsigned long *dst,
-                 void *private);
-
-Unlike other migration functions it works on a range of virtual address, there
-are two reasons for that. First, device DMA copy has a high setup overhead cost
-and thus batching multiple pages is needed as otherwise the migration overhead
-makes the whole exercise pointless. The second reason is because the
-migration might be for a range of addresses the device is actively accessing.
-
-The migrate_vma_ops struct defines two callbacks. First one (alloc_and_copy())
-controls destination memory allocation and copy operation. Second one is there
-to allow the device driver to perform cleanup operations after migration::
-
- struct migrate_vma_ops {
-     void (*alloc_and_copy)(struct vm_area_struct *vma,
-                            const unsigned long *src,
-                            unsigned long *dst,
-                            unsigned long start,
-                            unsigned long end,
-                            void *private);
-     void (*finalize_and_map)(struct vm_area_struct *vma,
-                              const unsigned long *src,
-                              const unsigned long *dst,
-                              unsigned long start,
-                              unsigned long end,
-                              void *private);
- };
-
-It is important to stress that these migration helpers allow for holes in the
-virtual address range. Some pages in the range might not be migrated for all
-the usual reasons (page is pinned, page is locked, ...). This helper does not
-fail but just skips over those pages.
-
-The alloc_and_copy() might decide to not migrate all pages in the
-range (for reasons under the callback control). For those, the callback just
-has to leave the corresponding dst entry empty.
-
-Finally, the migration of the struct page might fail (for file backed page) for
-various reasons (failure to freeze reference, or update page cache, ...). If
-that happens, then the finalize_and_map() can catch any pages that were not
-migrated. Note those pages were still copied to a new page and thus we wasted
-bandwidth but this is considered as a rare event and a price that we are
-willing to pay to keep all the code simpler.
+engine to perform copy from and to device memory. For this we need to use
+migrate_vma_setup(), migrate_vma_pages(), and migrate_vma_finalize() helpers.

- * access any of the virtual addresses originally backed by this page. Because
- * a SIGBUS is such a severe result for the userspace process, the device
- * driver should avoid setting MIGRATE_PFN_ERROR unless it is really in an

- *
- * For empty entry inside CPU page table (pte_none() or pmd_none() is true) we

- * and properly set the destination entry like for regular migration. Note that

- * callback just like for regular migration.
- *
- * THE alloc_and_copy() CALLBACK MUST NOT CHANGE ANY OF THE SRC ARRAY ENTRIES
- * OR BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN !
- *
- *
- * The finalize_and_map() callback happens after struct page migration from
- * source to destination (destination struct pages are the struct pages for the
- * memory allocated by the alloc_and_copy() callback).  Migration can fail, and

- * migrate_vma() - migrate a range of memory inside vma
- *
- * @ops: migration callback for allocating destination memory and copying
- * @vma: virtual memory area containing the range to be migrated
- * @start: start address of the range to migrate (inclusive)
- * @end: end address of the range to migrate (exclusive)
- * @src: array of hmm_pfn_t containing source pfns
- * @dst: array of hmm_pfn_t containing destination pfns
- * @private: pointer passed back to each of the callback
- * Returns: 0 on success, error code otherwise
- *
- * This function tries to migrate a range of memory virtual address range, using
- * callbacks to allocate and copy memory from source to destination. First it
- * collects all the pages backing each virtual address in the range, saving this
- * inside the src array. Then it locks those pages and unmaps them. Once the pages
- * are locked and unmapped, it checks whether each page is pinned or not. Pages
- * that aren't pinned have the MIGRATE_PFN_MIGRATE flag set (by this function)
- * in the corresponding src array entry. It then restores any pages that are
- * pinned, by remapping and unlocking those pages.
- *
- * At this point it calls the alloc_and_copy() callback. For documentation on
- * what is expected from that callback, see struct migrate_vma_ops comments in
- * include/linux/migrate.h
- *
- * After the alloc_and_copy() callback, this function goes over each entry in
- * the src array that has the MIGRATE_PFN_VALID and MIGRATE_PFN_MIGRATE flag
- * set. If the corresponding entry in dst array has MIGRATE_PFN_VALID flag set,
- * then the function tries to migrate struct page information from the source
- * struct page to the destination struct page. If it fails to migrate the struct
- * page information, then it clears the MIGRATE_PFN_MIGRATE flag in the src
- * array.
- *
- * At this point all successfully migrated pages have an entry in the src
- * array with MIGRATE_PFN_VALID and MIGRATE_PFN_MIGRATE flag set and the dst
- * array entry with MIGRATE_PFN_VALID flag set.
- *
- * It then calls the finalize_and_map() callback. See comments for "struct
- * migrate_vma_ops", in include/linux/migrate.h for details about
- * finalize_and_map() behavior.
- *
- * After the finalize_and_map() callback, for successfully migrated pages, this
- * function updates the CPU page table to point to new pages, otherwise it
- * restores the CPU page table to point to the original source pages.
- *
- * Function returns 0 after the above steps, even if no pages were migrated
- * (The function only returns an error if any of the arguments are invalid.)
- *
- * Both src and dst array must be big enough for (end - start) >> PAGE_SHIFT
- * unsigned long entries.
