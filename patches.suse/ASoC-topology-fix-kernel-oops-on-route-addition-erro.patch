Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: topology: fix kernel oops on route addition error
Git-commit: 6f0307df83f2aa6bdf656c2219c89ce96502d20e
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc7
References: git-fixes

When errors happens while loading graph components, the kernel oopses
while trying to remove all topology components. This can be
root-caused to a list pointing to memory that was already freed on
error.

remove_route() is already called on errors and will perform the
required cleanups so there's no need to free the route memory in
soc_tplg_dapm_graph_elems_load() if the route was added to the
list. We do however want to free the routes allocated but not added to
the list.
