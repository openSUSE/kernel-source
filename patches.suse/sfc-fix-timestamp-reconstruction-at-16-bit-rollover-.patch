Subject: sfc: fix timestamp reconstruction at 16-bit rollover points
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc4
Git-commit: 23797b98909f34b75fd130369bde86f760db69d0
References: jsc#SLE-16683

We can't just use the top bits of the last sync event as they could be
off-by-one every 65,536 seconds, giving an error in reconstruction of
65,536 seconds.

This patch uses the difference in the bottom 16 bits (mod 2^16) to
calculate an offset that needs to be applied to the last sync event to
get to the current time.
