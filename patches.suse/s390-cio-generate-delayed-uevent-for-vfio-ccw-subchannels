Subject: s390/cio: generate delayed uevent for vfio-ccw subchannels
Git-commit: 2bc55eaeb88d30accfc1b6ac2708d4e4b81ca260
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: git-fixes

The common I/O layer delays the ADD uevent for subchannels and
delegates generating this uevent to the individual subchannel
drivers. The vfio-ccw I/O subchannel driver, however, did not
do that, and will not generate an ADD uevent for subchannels
that had not been bound to a different driver (or none at all,
which also triggers the uevent).

Generate the ADD uevent at the end of the probe function if
uevents were still suppressed for the device.
