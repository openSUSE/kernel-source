Subject: [PATCH] usb: usbfs: correct kernel->user page attribute mismatch
Git-commit: 2bef9aed6f0e22391c8d4570749b1acc9bc3981e
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc5
References: git-fixes

On some architectures (e.g. arm64) requests for
IO coherent memory may use non-cachable attributes if
the relevant device isn't cache coherent. If these
pages are then remapped into userspace as cacheable,
they may not be coherent with the non-cacheable mappings.

In particular this happens with libusb, when it attempts
to create zero-copy buffers for use by rtl-sdr
(https://github.com/osmocom/rtl-sdr/). On low end arm
devices with non-coherent USB ports, the application will
be unexpectedly killed, while continuing to work fine on
arm machines with coherent USB controllers.

This bug has been discovered/reported a few times over
the last few years. In the case of rtl-sdr a compile time
option to enable/disable zero copy was implemented to
work around it.

Rather than relaying on application specific workarounds,
dma_mmap_coherent() can be used instead of remap_pfn_range().
The page cache/etc attributes will then be correctly set in
userspace to match the kernel mapping.
