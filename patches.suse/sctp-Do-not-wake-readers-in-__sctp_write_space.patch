Subject: sctp: Do not wake readers in __sctp_write_space()
Patch-mainline: v6.16-rc1
Git-commit: af295892a7abbf05a3c2ba7abc4d81bb448623d6
References: git-fixes

Function __sctp_write_space() doesn't set poll key, which leads to
ep_poll_callback() waking up all waiters, not only these waiting
for the socket being writable. Set the key properly using
wake_up_interruptible_poll(), which is preferred over the sync
variant, as writers are not woken up before at least half of the
queue is available. Also, TCP does the same.
