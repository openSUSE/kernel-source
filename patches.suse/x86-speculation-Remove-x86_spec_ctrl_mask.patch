Subject: x86/speculation: Remove x86_spec_ctrl_mask
Git-commit: acac5e98ef8d638a411cfa2ee676c87e1973f126
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc7
References: bsc#1199657 CVE-2022-29900 CVE-2022-29901

This mask has been made redundant by kvm_spec_ctrl_test_value().  And it
doesn't even work when MSR interception is disabled, as the guest can
just write to SPEC_CTRL directly.
