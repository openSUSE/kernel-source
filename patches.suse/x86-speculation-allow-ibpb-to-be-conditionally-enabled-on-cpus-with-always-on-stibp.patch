Subject: x86/speculation: Allow IBPB to be conditionally enabled on CPUs with
 always-on STIBP
Git-commit: 1978b3a53a74e3230cd46932b149c6e62e832e9a
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc3
References: bsc#1152489

On AMD CPUs which have the feature X86_FEATURE_AMD_STIBP_ALWAYS_ON,
STIBP is set to on and

  spectre_v2_user_stibp == SPECTRE_V2_USER_STRICT_PREFERRED

At the same time, IBPB can be set to conditional.

However, this leads to the case where it's impossible to turn on IBPB
for a process because in the PR_SPEC_DISABLE case in ib_prctl_set() the

  spectre_v2_user_stibp == SPECTRE_V2_USER_STRICT_PREFERRED

condition leads to a return before the task flag is set. Similarly,
ib_prctl_get() will return PR_SPEC_DISABLE even though IBPB is set to
conditional.

More generally, the following cases are possible:

1. STIBP = conditional && IBPB = on for spectre_v2_user=seccomp,ibpb
2. STIBP = on && IBPB = conditional for AMD CPUs with
   X86_FEATURE_AMD_STIBP_ALWAYS_ON

The first case functions correctly today, but only because
spectre_v2_user_ibpb isn't updated to reflect the IBPB mode.

At a high level, this change does one thing. If either STIBP or IBPB
is set to conditional, allow the prctl to change the task flag.
Also, reflect that capability when querying the state. This isn't
perfect since it doesn't take into account if only STIBP or IBPB is
unconditionally on. But it allows the conditional feature to work as
expected, without affecting the unconditional one.
