Subject: [PATCH] KVM: PPC: Book3S HV P9: Restore host CTRL SPR after guest
 exit

References: bsc#1156395
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc1
Git-commit: 5088eb4092df12d701af8e0e92860b7186365279

The host CTRL (runlatch) value is not restored after guest exit. The
host CTRL should always be 1 except in CPU idle code, so this can result
in the host running with runlatch clear, and potentially switching to
a different vCPU which then runs with runlatch clear as well.

This has little effect on P9 machines, CTRL is only responsible for some
PMU counter logic in the host and so other than corner cases of software
relying on that, or explicitly reading the runlatch value (Linux does
not appear to be affected but it's possible non-Linux guests could be),
there should be no execution correctness problem, though it could be
used as a covert channel between guests.

There may be microcontrollers, firmware or monitoring tools that sample
the runlatch value out-of-band, however since the register is writable
by guests, these values would (should) not be relied upon for correct
operation of the host, so suboptimal performance or incorrect reporting
should be the worst problem.
