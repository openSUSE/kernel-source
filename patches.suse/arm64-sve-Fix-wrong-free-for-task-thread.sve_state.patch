Subject: arm64/sve: Fix wrong free for task->thread.sve_state
Git-commit: 4585fc59c0e813188d6a4c5de1f6976fce461fc2
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc3
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.7

The system which has SVE feature crashed because of
the memory pointed by task->thread.sve_state was destroyed
by someone.

That is because sve_state is freed while the forking the
child process. The child process has the pointer of sve_state
which is same as the parent's because the child's task_struct
is copied from the parent's one. If the copy_process()
fails as an error on somewhere, for example, copy_creds(),
then the sve_state is freed even if the parent is alive.
The flow is as follows.

copy_process
        p = dup_task_struct
            => arch_dup_task_struct
                *dst = *src;  // copy the entire region.
:
        retval = copy_creds
        if (retval < 0)
                goto bad_fork_free;
:
bad_fork_free:
...
        delayed_free_task(p);
          => free_task
             => arch_release_task_struct
                => fpsimd_release_task
                   => __sve_free
                      => kfree(task->thread.sve_state);
                         // free the parent's sve_state

Move child's sve_state = NULL and clearing TIF_SVE flag
to arch_dup_task_struct() so that the child doesn't free the
parent's one.
There is no need to wait until copy_process() to clear TIF_SVE for
dst, because the thread flags for dst are initialized already by
copying the src task_struct.
This change simplifies the code, so get rid of comments that are no
longer needed.

As a note, arm64 used to have thread_info on the stack. So it
would not be possible to clear TIF_SVE until the stack is initialized.
From commit c02433dd6de3 ("arm64: split thread_info from task stack"),
the thread_info is part of the task, so it should be valid to modify
the flag from arch_dup_task_struct().
