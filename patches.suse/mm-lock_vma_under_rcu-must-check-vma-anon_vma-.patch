Subject: [PATCH] mm: lock_vma_under_rcu() must check vma->anon_vma under vma
 lock
Patch-mainline: 6.4.10
References: bsc#1012628 per-VMA_lock_fix CVE-2024-1312 bsc#1219731
Git-commit: 657b5146955eba331e01b9a6ae89ce2e716ba306

commit 657b5146955eba331e01b9a6ae89ce2e716ba306 upstream.

lock_vma_under_rcu() tries to guarantee that __anon_vma_prepare() can't
be called in the VMA-locked page fault path by ensuring that
vma->anon_vma is set.

However, this check happens before the VMA is locked, which means a
concurrent move_vma() can concurrently call unlink_anon_vmas(), which
disassociates the VMA's anon_vma.

This means we can get UAF in the following scenario:

  THREAD 1                   THREAD 2
  ========                   ========
  <page fault>
    lock_vma_under_rcu()
      rcu_read_lock()
      mas_walk()
      check vma->anon_vma

                             mremap() syscall
                               move_vma()
                                vma_start_write()
                                 unlink_anon_vmas()
                             <syscall end>

    handle_mm_fault()
      __handle_mm_fault()
        handle_pte_fault()
          do_pte_missing()
            do_anonymous_page()
              anon_vma_prepare()
                __anon_vma_prepare()
                  find_mergeable_anon_vma()
                    mas_walk() [looks up VMA X]

                             munmap() syscall (deletes VMA X)

                    reusable_anon_vma() [called on freed VMA X]

This is a security bug if you can hit it, although an attacker would
have to win two races at once where the first race window is only a few
instructions wide.

This patch is based on some previous discussion with Linus Torvalds on
the security list.
