Subject: mmc: sdhci: improve ADMA error reporting
Git-commit: d1c536e3177390da43d99f20143b810c35433d1f
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.6

ADMA errors are potentially data corrupting events; although we print
the register state, we do not usefully print the ADMA descriptors.
Worse than that, we print them by referencing their virtual address
which is meaningless when the register state gives us the DMA address
of the failing descriptor.

Print the ADMA descriptors giving their DMA addresses rather than their
virtual addresses, and print them using SDHCI_DUMP() rather than DBG().

We also do not show the correct value of the interrupt status register;
the register dump shows the current value, after we have cleared the
pending interrupts we are going to service.  What is more useful is to
print the interrupts that _were_ pending at the time the ADMA error was
encountered.  Fix that too.
