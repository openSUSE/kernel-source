Subject: irqchip/gic-v4: Correctly deal with set_affinity on lazily-mapped
 VPEs
References: CVE-2024-50192 bsc#1233106
Git-commit: e6c24e2d05bb05de96ffb9bdb0ee62d20ad526f8
Patch-mainline: 6.12-rc6

Zenghui points out that a recent change to the way set_affinity is
handled for VPEs has the potential to return an error if the VPE
hasn't been mapped yet (because the guest hasn't emited a MAPTI
command yet), affecting GICv4.0 implementations that rely on the
ITSList feature.

Fix this by making the set_affinity succeed in this case, and
return early, without trying to touch the HW.
