Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: only commit the delayed inode when doing a full fsync

Commit 2c2c452b0cafdc ("Btrfs: fix fsync when extend references are added
to an inode") forced a commit of the delayed inode when logging an inode
in order to ensure we would end up logging the inode item during a full
fsync. By committing the delayed inode, we updated the inode item in the
fs/subvolume tree and then later when copying items from leafs modified in
the current transaction into the log tree (with copy_inode_items_to_log())
we ended up copying the inode item from the fs/subvolume tree into the log
tree. Logging an up to date version of the inode item is required to make
sure at log replay time we get the link count fixup triggered among other
things (replay xattr deletes, etc). The test case generic/040 from fstests
exercises the bug which that commit fixed.

However for a fast fsync we don't need to commit the delayed inode because
we always log an up to date version of the inode item based on the struct
btrfs_inode we have in-memory. We started doing this for fast fsyncs since
commit e4545de5b035c7 ("Btrfs: fix fsync data loss after append write").

So just stop committing the delayed inode if we are doing a fast fsync,
we are only wasting time and adding contention on fs/subvolume tree.

This patch is part of a series that has the following patches:

1/4 btrfs: only commit the delayed inode when doing a full fsync
2/4 btrfs: only commit delayed items at fsync if we are logging a directory
3/4 btrfs: stop incremening log_batch for the log root tree when syncing log
4/4 btrfs: remove no longer needed use of log_writers for the log root tree

After the entire patchset applied I saw about 12% decrease on max latency
reported by dbench. The test was done on a qemu vm, with 8 cores, 16Gb of
ram, using kvm and using a raw NVMe device directly (no intermediary fs on
the host). The test was invoked like the following:

  mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdk
  mount -o ssd -o nospace_cache /dev/sdk /mnt/sdk
  dbench -D /mnt/sdk -t 300 8
  umount /mnt/dsk
