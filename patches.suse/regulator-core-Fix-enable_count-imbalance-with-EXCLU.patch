Subject: [PATCH] regulator: core: Fix enable_count imbalance with EXCLUSIVE_GET
Git-commit: c3e3ca05dae37f8f74bb80358efd540911cbc2c8
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: git-fixes

Since the introduction of regulator->enable_count, a driver that did
an exclusive get on an already-enabled regulator would end up with
enable_count initialized to 0 but rdev->use_count initialized to 1.
With that starting point the regulator is effectively stuck enabled,
because if the driver attempted to disable it it would fail the
enable_count underflow check in _regulator_handle_consumer_disable().

The EXCLUSIVE_GET path in _regulator_get() now initializes
enable_count along with rdev->use_count so that the regulator can be
disabled without underflowing the former.
