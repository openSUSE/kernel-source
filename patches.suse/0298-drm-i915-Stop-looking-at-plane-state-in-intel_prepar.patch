Subject: drm/i915: Stop looking at plane->state in intel_prepare_plane_fb()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: b2faf669866e715231fc2a43ea69adf97a13ca01
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-12680, jsc#SLE-12880, jsc#SLE-12882, jsc#SLE-12883, jsc#SLE-13496, jsc#SLE-15322

Switch over to using explicit old/new planes states instead of
digging the old state out via plane->state. The main issue is that
plane->state will point to the uapi state which we generally don't
even want to look at.

Also it sets a bad example as using plane->state during commit_tail()
would be a bug. Here we're still holding the modeset locks so it's
actually safe, but best not give people bad ideas.
