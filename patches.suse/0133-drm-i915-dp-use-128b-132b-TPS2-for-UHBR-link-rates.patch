Subject: drm/i915/dp: use 128b/132b TPS2 for UHBR+ link rates
Git-commit: 078397bbad2d70cef41771322801b73b39daddb3
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

128b/132b channel encoding has separate TPS1 and TPS2, although the DPCD
register values coincide with 8b/10b TPS1 and TPS2 values. Use 128b/132b
TPS2 for channel equalization.

v2: Use intel_dp_is_uhbr
