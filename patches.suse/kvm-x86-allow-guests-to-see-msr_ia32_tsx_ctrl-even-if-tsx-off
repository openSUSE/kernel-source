Subject: KVM: x86: Allow guests to see MSR_IA32_TSX_CTRL even if tsx=off
Git-commit: 7131636e7ea5b50ca910f8953f6365ef2d1f741c
Patch-mainline: v5.11-rc7
References: bsc#1183323

Userspace that does not know about KVM_GET_MSR_FEATURE_INDEX_LIST
will generally use the default value for MSR_IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES.
When this happens and the host has tsx=on, it is possible to end up with
virtual machines that have HLE and RTM disabled, but TSX_CTRL available.

If the fleet is then switched to tsx=off, kvm_get_arch_capabilities()
will clear the ARCH_CAP_TSX_CTRL_MSR bit and it will not be possible to
use the tsx=off hosts as migration destinations, even though the guests
do not have TSX enabled.

To allow this migration, allow guests to write to their TSX_CTRL MSR,
while keeping the host MSR unchanged for the entire life of the guests.
This ensures that TSX remains disabled and also saves MSR reads and
writes, and it's okay to do because with tsx=off we know that guests will
not have the HLE and RTM features in their CPUID.  (If userspace sets
bogus CPUID data, we do not expect HLE and RTM to work in guests anyway).
