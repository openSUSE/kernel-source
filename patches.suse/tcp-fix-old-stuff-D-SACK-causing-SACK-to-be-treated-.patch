Subject: tcp: fix "old stuff" D-SACK causing SACK to be treated as D-SACK
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc6
Git-commit: c9655008e7845bcfdaac10a1ed8554ec167aea88
References: bsc#1154353

When we receive a D-SACK, where the sequence number satisfies:
	undo_marker <= start_seq < end_seq <= prior_snd_una
we consider this is a valid D-SACK and tcp_is_sackblock_valid()
returns true, then this D-SACK is discarded as "old stuff",
but the variable first_sack_index is not marked as negative
in tcp_sacktag_write_queue().

If this D-SACK also carries a SACK that needs to be processed
(for example, the previous SACK segment was lost), this SACK
will be treated as a D-SACK in the following processing of
tcp_sacktag_write_queue(), which will eventually lead to
incorrect updates of undo_retrans and reordering.

Fixes: fd6dad616d4f ("[TCP]: Earlier SACK block verification & simplify access to them")
