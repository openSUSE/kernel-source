Subject: [PATCH] cifs: fix stray unlock in cifs_chan_skip_or_disable
Git-commit: 993d1c346b1a51ac41b2193609a0d4e51e9748f4
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc2

A recent change moved the code that decides to skip
a channel or disable multichannel entirely, into a
helper function.

During this, a mutex_unlock of the session_mutex
should have been removed. Doing that here.

Fixes: f591062bdbf4 ("cifs: handle servers that still advertise multichannel after disabling")
