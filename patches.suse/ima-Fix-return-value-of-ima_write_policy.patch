Subject: [PATCH] ima: Fix return value of ima_write_policy()
References: bsc#1171709
Git-commit: 2e3a34e9f409ebe83d1af7cd2f49fca7af97dfac
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc7

This patch fixes the return value of ima_write_policy() when a new policy
is directly passed to IMA and the current policy requires appraisal of the
file containing the policy. Currently, if appraisal is not in ENFORCE mode,
ima_write_policy() returns 0 and leads user space applications to an
endless loop. Fix this issue by denying the operation regardless of the
appraisal mode.
