Subject: irqchip/gic-v4: Use Inner-Shareable attributes for virtual pending
 tables
Git-commit: b2cb11f4f7643255b7703c0fcabc31a8ec478f3a
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-14773

There is no special reason to set virtual LPI pending table as
non-shareable. If we choose to hard code the shareability without
probing, Inner-Shareable is likely to be a better choice, as the
VPEs can move around and benefit from having the redistributors
snooping each other's cache, if that's something they can do.

Furthermore, Hisilicon hip08 ends up with unspecified errors when
mixing shareability attributes. So let's move to IS attributes for
the VPT. This has also been tested on D05 and didn't show any
regression.
