Subject: [PATCH] Revert "ath6kl: return error code in ath6kl_wmi_set_roam_lrssi_cmd()"
Git-commit: efba106f89fc6848726716c101f4c84e88720a9c
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc3
References: git-fixes

This reverts commit fc6a6521556c8250e356ddc6a3f2391aa62dc976.

Because of recent interactions with developers from @umn.edu, all
commits from them have been recently re-reviewed to ensure if they were
correct or not.

Upon review, this commit was found to be incorrect for the reasons
below, so it must be reverted.  It will be fixed up "correctly" in a
later kernel change.

The change being reverted does NOTHING as the caller to this function
does not even look at the return value of the call.  So the "claim" that
this fixed an an issue is not true.  It will be fixed up properly in a
future patch by propagating the error up the stack correctly.
