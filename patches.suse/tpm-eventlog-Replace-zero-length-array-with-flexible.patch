Subject: tpm: eventlog: Replace zero-length array with flexible-array member

References: jsc#SLE-15209

The current codebase makes use of the zero-length array language
extension to the C90 standard, but the preferred mechanism to declare
variable-length types such as these ones is a flexible array member[1][2],
introduced in C99:

struct foo {
        int stuff;
        struct boo array[];
};

By making use of the mechanism above, we will get a compiler warning
in case the flexible array does not occur last in the structure, which
will help us prevent some kind of undefined behavior bugs from being
inadvertently introduced[3] to the codebase from now on.

Also, notice that, dynamic memory allocations won't be affected by
this change:

"Flexible array members have incomplete type, and so the sizeof operator
may not be applied. As a quirk of the original implementation of
zero-length arrays, sizeof evaluates to zero."[1]

sizeof(flexible-array-member) triggers a warning because flexible array
members have incomplete type[1]. There are some instances of code in
which the sizeof operator is being incorrectly/erroneously applied to
zero-length arrays and the result is zero. Such instances may be hiding
some bugs. So, this work (flexible-array member conversions) will also
help to get completely rid of those sorts of issues.

Also, the following issue shows up due to the flexible-array member
having incomplete type[4]:

drivers/char/tpm/eventlog/tpm2.c: In function ‘tpm2_bios_measurements_start’:
drivers/char/tpm/eventlog/tpm2.c:54:46: error: invalid application of ‘sizeof’ to incomplete type ‘u8[]’ {aka ‘unsigned char[]’}
   54 |  size = sizeof(struct tcg_pcr_event) - sizeof(event_header->event)
      |                                              ^
drivers/char/tpm/eventlog/tpm2.c: In function ‘tpm2_bios_measurements_next’:
drivers/char/tpm/eventlog/tpm2.c:102:10: error: invalid application of ‘sizeof’ to incomplete type ‘u8[]’ {aka ‘unsigned char[]’}
  102 |    sizeof(event_header->event) + event_header->event_size;
      |          ^
drivers/char/tpm/eventlog/tpm2.c: In function ‘tpm2_binary_bios_measurements_show’:
drivers/char/tpm/eventlog/tpm2.c:140:10: error: invalid application of ‘sizeof’ to incomplete type ‘u8[]’ {aka ‘unsigned char[]’}
  140 |    sizeof(event_header->event) + event_header->event_size;
      |          ^
scripts/Makefile.build:266: recipe for target 'drivers/char/tpm/eventlog/tpm2.o' failed
make[3]: *** [drivers/char/tpm/eventlog/tpm2.o] Error 1

As mentioned above: "Flexible array members have incomplete type, and
so the sizeof operator may not be applied. As a quirk of the original
implementation of zero-length arrays, sizeof evaluates to zero."[1] As
in "sizeof(event_header->event) always evaluated to 0, so removing it
has no effect".

Lastly, make use of the struct_size() helper to deal with the
flexible array member and its host structure.

This issue was found with the help of Coccinelle.
