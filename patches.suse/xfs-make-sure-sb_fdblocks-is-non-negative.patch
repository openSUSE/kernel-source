Subject: [PATCH] xfs: make sure sb_fdblocks is non-negative
Git-commit: 58f880711f2ba53fd5e959875aff5b3bf6d5c32e
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc4
References: git-fixes

A user with a completely full filesystem experienced an unexpected
shutdown when the filesystem tried to write the superblock during
runtime.
kernel shows the following dmesg:

[    8.182010] XFS (dm-4): Please unmount the filesystem and rectify the problem(s)

When xfs_log_sb writes super block to disk, b_fdblocks is fetched from
m_fdblocks without any lock. As m_fdblocks can experience a positive ->
negative -> positive changing when the FS reaches fullness (see
xfs_mod_fdblocks). So there is a chance that sb_fdblocks is negative, and
because sb_fdblocks is type of unsigned long long, it reads super big.
And sb_fdblocks being bigger than sb_dblocks is a problem during log
recovery, xfs_validate_sb_write() complains.

Fix: 
As sb_fdblocks will be re-calculated during mount when lazysbcount is
enabled, We just need to make xfs_validate_sb_write() happy -- make sure
sb_fdblocks is not nenative. This patch also takes care of other percpu
counters in xfs_log_sb.
