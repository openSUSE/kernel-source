Subject: [PATCH] mm, page_alloc: fix build_zonerefs_node()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Since commit 6aa303defb74 ("mm, vmscan: only allocate and reclaim from
zones with pages managed by the buddy allocator") only zones with free
memory are included in a built zonelist.  This is problematic when e.g.
all memory of a zone has been ballooned out when zonelists are being
rebuilt.

The decision whether to rebuild the zonelists when onlining new memory
is done based on populated_zone() returning 0 for the zone the memory
will be added to.  The new zone is added to the zonelists only, if it
has free memory pages (managed_zone() returns a non-zero value) after
the memory has been onlined.  This implies, that onlining memory will
always free the added pages to the allocator immediately, but this is
not true in all cases: when e.g. running as a Xen guest the onlined new
memory will be added only to the ballooned memory list, it will be freed
only when the guest is being ballooned up afterwards.

Another problem with using managed_zone() for the decision whether a
zone is being added to the zonelists is, that a zone with all memory
used will in fact be removed from all zonelists in case the zonelists
happen to be rebuilt.

Use populated_zone() when building a zonelist as it has been done before
that commit.

There was a report that QubesOS (based on Xen) is hitting this problem.
Xen has switched to use the zone device functionality in kernel 5.9 and
QubesOS wants to use memory hotplugging for guests in order to be able
to start a guest with minimal memory and expand it as needed.  This was
the report leading to the patch.
