Subject: [PATCH] drm/mipi-dsi: Fix theoretical int overflow in mipi_dsi_dcs_write_seq()
Git-commit: 0b03829fdece47beba9ecb7dbcbde4585ee3663e
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
References: git-fixes

The mipi_dsi_dcs_write_seq() macro makes a call to
mipi_dsi_dcs_write_buffer() which returns a type ssize_t. The macro
then stores it in an int and checks to see if it's negative. This
could theoretically be a problem if "ssize_t" is larger than "int".

To see the issue, imagine that "ssize_t" is 32-bits and "int" is
16-bits, you could see a problem if there was some code out there that
looked like:

  mipi_dsi_dcs_write_seq(dsi, cmd, <32767 bytes as arguments>);

...since we'd get back that 32768 bytes were transferred and 32768
stored in a 16-bit int would look negative.

Though there are no callsites where we'd actually hit this (even if
"int" was only 16-bit), it's cleaner to make the types match so let's
fix it.
