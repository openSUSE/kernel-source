Subject: ipmi:ssif: Improve detecting during probing
Git-commit: 88f65f903d25aed8801d795470042754cb18ec67
Git-repo: git://github.com/cminyard/linux-ipmi.git
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
References: bsc#1228771

If an IPMI SSIF device is probed and there is something there, but
probably not an actual BMC, the code would just issue a lot of errors
before it failed.  We kind of need these errors to help with certain
issues, and some of the failure reports are non-fatal.

However, a get device id command should alway work.  If that fails,
nothing else is going to work and it's a pretty good indication that
there's no valid BMC there.  So issue and check that command and bail
if it fails.
