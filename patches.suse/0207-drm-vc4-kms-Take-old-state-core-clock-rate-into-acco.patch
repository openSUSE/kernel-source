Subject: drm/vc4: kms: Take old state core clock rate into account
Git-commit: 748acfc98adab21a93ae7a1b5bed0f048463e873
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

During a commit, the core clock, which feeds the HVS, needs to run at
a minimum of 500MHz.

While doing that commit, we can also change the mode to one that
requires a higher core clock, so we take the core clock rate associated
to that new state into account for that boost.

However, the old state also needs to be taken into account if it
requires a core clock higher that the new one and our 500MHz limit,
since it's still live in hardware at the beginning of our commit.

Fixes: 16e101051f32 ("drm/vc4: Increase the core clock based on HVS load")
