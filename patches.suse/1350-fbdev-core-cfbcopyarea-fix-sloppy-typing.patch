Subject: fbdev: core: cfbcopyarea: fix sloppy typing
Git-commit: 7f33df94cf0156f64eee9509bd9b4a178990f613
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc7
References: drm-backport-placeholder jsc#PED-3527 jsc#PED-5475 jsc#PED-6068 jsc#PED-6070 jsc#PED-6116 jsc#PED-6120 jsc#PED-5065 jsc#PED-5477 jsc#PED-5511 jsc#PED-6041 jsc#PED-6069 jsc#PED-6071

In cfb_copyarea(), the local variable bits_per_line is needlessly typed as
*unsigned long* -- which is a 32-bit type on the 32-bit arches and a 64-bit
type on the 64-bit arches; that variable's value is derived from the __u32
typed fb_fix_screeninfo::line_length field (multiplied by 8u) and a 32-bit
*unsigned int* type should still be enough to store the # of bits per line.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with the Svace static
analysis tool.
