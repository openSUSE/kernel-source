Subject: [PATCH] dm verity fec: fix hash block number in verity_fec_decode
Git-commit: ad4e80a639fc61d5ecebb03caa5cdbfb91fcebfc
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc4
References: git fixes (block drivers)

The error correction data is computed as if data and hash blocks
were concatenated. But hash block number starts from v->hash_start.
So, we have to calculate hash block number based on that.

Fixes: a739ff3f543af ("dm verity: add support for forward error correction")
