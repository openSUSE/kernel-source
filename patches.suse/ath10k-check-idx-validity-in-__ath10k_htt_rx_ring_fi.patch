Subject: [PATCH] ath10k: check idx validity in __ath10k_htt_rx_ring_fill_n()
Git-commit: bad60b8d1a7194df38fd7fe4b22f3f4dcf775099
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc1
References: git-fixes

The idx in __ath10k_htt_rx_ring_fill_n function lives in
consistent dma region writable by the device. Malfunctional
or malicious device could manipulate such idx to have a OOB
write. Either by
    htt->rx_ring.netbufs_ring[idx] = skb;
or by
    ath10k_htt_set_paddrs_ring(htt, paddr, idx);

The idx can also be negative as it's signed, giving a large
memory space to write to.

It's possibly exploitable by corruptting a legit pointer with
a skb pointer. And then fill skb with payload as rougue object.

Part of the log here. Sometimes it appears as UAF when writing
to a freed memory by chance.
