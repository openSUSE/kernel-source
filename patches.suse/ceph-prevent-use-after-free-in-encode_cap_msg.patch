Subject: ceph: prevent use-after-free in encode_cap_msg()
Git-commit: cda4672da1c26835dcbd7aec2bfed954eda9b5ef
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc4
References: bsc#1221391

In fs/ceph/caps.c, in encode_cap_msg(), "use after free" error was
caught by KASAN at this line - 'ceph_buffer_get(arg->xattr_buf);'. This
implies before the refcount could be increment here, it was freed.

In same file, in "handle_cap_grant()" refcount is decremented by this
line - 'ceph_buffer_put(ci->i_xattrs.blob);'. It appears that a race
occurred and resource was freed by the latter line before the former
line could increment it.

encode_cap_msg() is called by __send_cap() and __send_cap() is called by
ceph_check_caps() after calling __prep_cap(). __prep_cap() is where
arg->xattr_buf is assigned to ci->i_xattrs.blob. This is the spot where
the refcount must be increased to prevent "use after free" error.
