Subject: [PATCH] soc: qcom: rpmhpd: Make power_on actually enable the domain
Git-commit: e3e56c050ab6e3f1bd811f0787f50709017543e4
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: git-fixes stable-5.14.19

The general expectation is that powering on a power-domain should make
the power domain deliver some power, and if a specific performance state
is needed further requests has to be made.

But in contrast with other power-domain implementations (e.g. rpmpd) the
RPMh does not have an interface to enable the power, so the driver has
to vote for a particular corner (performance level) in rpmh_power_on().

But the corner is never initialized, so a typical request to simply
enable the power domain would not actually turn on the hardware. Further
more, when no more clients vote for a performance state (i.e. the
aggregated vote is 0) the power domain would be turned off.

Fix both of these issues by always voting for a corner with non-zero
value, when the power domain is enabled.

The tracking of the lowest non-zero corner is performed to handle the
corner case if there's ever a domain with a non-zero lowest corner, in
which case both rpmh_power_on() and rpmh_rpmhpd_set_performance_state()
would be allowed to use this lowest corner.
