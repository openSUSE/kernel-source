Subject: libceph: fix invalid accesses to ceph_connection_v1_info
Git-commit: cdbc9836c7afadad68f374791738f118263c5371
Patch-mainline: v6.12.48
References: CVE-2025-39880 bsc#1250388

There is a place where generic code in messenger.c is reading and
another place where it is writing to con->v1 union member without
checking that the union member is active (i.e. msgr1 is in use).

On 64-bit systems, con->v1.auth_retry overlaps with con->v2.out_iter,
so such a read is almost guaranteed to return a bogus value instead of
0 when msgr2 is in use.  This ends up being fairly benign because the
side effect is just the invalidation of the authorizer and successive
fetching of new tickets.

con->v1.connect_seq overlaps with con->v2.conn_bufs and the fact that
it's being written to can cause more serious consequences, but luckily
it's not something that happens often.
