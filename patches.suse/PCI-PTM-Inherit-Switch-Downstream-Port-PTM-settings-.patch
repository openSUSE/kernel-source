Subject: [PATCH] PCI/PTM: Inherit Switch Downstream Port PTM settings from Upstream Port
Git-commit: 7b38fd9760f51cc83d80eed2cfbde8b5ead9e93a
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
References: git-fixes

Except for Endpoints, we enable PTM at enumeration-time.  Previously we did
not account for the fact that Switch Downstream Ports are not permitted to
have a PTM capability; their PTM behavior is controlled by the Upstream
Port (PCIe r5.0, sec 7.9.16).  Since Downstream Ports don't have a PTM
capability, we did not mark them as "ptm_enabled", which meant that
pci_enable_ptm() on an Endpoint failed because there was no PTM path to it.

Mark Downstream Ports as "ptm_enabled" if their Upstream Port has PTM
enabled.

Fixes: eec097d43100 ("PCI: Add pci_enable_ptm() for drivers to enable PTM on endpoints")
