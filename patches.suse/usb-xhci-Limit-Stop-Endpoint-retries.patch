Subject: [PATCH] usb: xhci: Limit Stop Endpoint retries
Git-commit: 42b7581376015c1bbcbe5831f043cd0ac119d028
References: jsc#PED-10701
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1

Some host controllers fail to atomically transition an endpoint to the
Running state on a doorbell ring and enter a hidden "Restarting" state,
which looks very much like Stopped, with the important difference that
it will spontaneously transition to Running anytime soon.

A Stop Endpoint command queued in the Restarting state typically fails
with Context State Error and the completion handler sees the Endpoint
Context State as either still Stopped or already Running. Even a case
of Halted was observed, when an error occurred right after the restart.

The Halted state is already recovered from by resetting the endpoint.
The Running state is handled by retrying Stop Endpoint.

The Stopped state was recognized as a problem on NEC controllers and
worked around also by retrying, because the endpoint soon restarts and
then stops for good. But there is a risk: the command may fail if the
endpoint is "stopped for good" already, and retries will fail forever.

The possibility of this was not realized at the time, but a number of
cases were discovered later and reproduced. Some proved difficult to
deal with, and it is outright impossible to predict if an endpoint may
fail to ever start at all due to a hardware bug. One such bug (albeit
on ASM3142, not on NEC) was found to be reliably triggered simply by
toggling an AX88179 NIC up/down in a tight loop for a few seconds.

An endless retries storm is quite nasty. Besides putting needless load
on the xHC and CPU, it causes URBs never to be given back, paralyzing
the device and connection/disconnection logic for the whole bus if the
device is unplugged. User processes waiting for URBs become unkillable,
drivers and kworker threads lock up and xhci_hcd cannot be reloaded.

For peace of mind, impose a timeout on Stop Endpoint retries in this
case. If they don't succeed in 100ms, consider the endpoint stopped
permanently for some reason and just give back the unlinked URBs. This
failure case is rare already and work is under way to make it rarer.

Start this work today by also handling one simple case of race with
Reset Endpoint, because it costs just two lines to implement.
