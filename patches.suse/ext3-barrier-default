Subject: make ext3 mount default to barrier=1

Hello everyone,

This patch turns on barriers by default for ext3.  mount -o barrier=0
will turn them off.  It also changes the ext3 fsync call to trigger a
barrier when a commit isn't done.

It should be safe, but some extra review would be appreciated.

Updated Apr 13 2009 jeffm:
- Added Kconfig option

+	  Modern disk drives support write caches that can speed up writeback.

+	  severe corruption in the event of power loss.
+
+	  The -o barrier option enables the file system to direct the block
