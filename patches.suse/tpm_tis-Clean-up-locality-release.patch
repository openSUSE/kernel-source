Subject: [PATCH] tpm_tis: Clean up locality release
Git-commit: e42acf104d6e0bd7ccd2f09103d5be5e6d3c637c
Patch-mainline: v5.12-rc1
References: git-fixes

The current release locality code seems to be based on the
misunderstanding that the TPM interrupts when a locality is released:
it doesn't, only when the locality is acquired.

Furthermore, there seems to be no point in waiting for the locality to
be released.  All it does is penalize the last TPM user.  However, if
there's no next TPM user, this is a pointless wait and if there is a
next TPM user, they'll pay the penalty waiting for the new locality
(or possibly not if it's the same as the old locality).

Fix the code by making release_locality as simple write to release
with no waiting for completion.
