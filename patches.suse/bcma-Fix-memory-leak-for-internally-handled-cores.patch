Subject: [PATCH] bcma: Fix memory leak for internally-handled cores
Git-commit: b63aed3ff195130fef12e0af590f4838cf0201d8
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: git-fixes

kmemleak reported that dev_name() of internally-handled cores were leaked
on driver unbinding. Let's use device_initialize() to take refcounts for
them and put_device() to properly free the related stuff.

While looking at it, there's another potential issue for those which should
be *registered* into driver core. If device_register() failed, we put
device once and freed bcma_device structures. In bcma_unregister_cores(),
they're treated as unregistered and we hit both UAF and double-free. That
smells not good and has also been fixed now.

Fixes: ab54bc8460b5 ("bcma: fill core details for every device")
