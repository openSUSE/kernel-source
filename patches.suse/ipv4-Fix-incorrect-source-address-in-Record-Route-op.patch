Subject: ipv4: Fix incorrect source address in Record Route option
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
Git-commit: cc73bbab4b1fb8a4f53a24645871dafa5f81266a
References: git-fixes

The Record Route IP option records the addresses of the routers that
routed the packet. In the case of forwarded packets, the kernel performs
a route lookup via fib_lookup() and fills in the preferred source
address of the matched route.

The lookup is performed with the DS field of the forwarded packet, but
using the RT_TOS() macro which only masks one of the two ECN bits. If
the packet is ECT(0) or CE, the matched route might be different than
the route via which the packet was forwarded as the input path masks
both of the ECN bits, resulting in the wrong address being filled in the
Record Route option.

Fix by masking both of the ECN bits.
