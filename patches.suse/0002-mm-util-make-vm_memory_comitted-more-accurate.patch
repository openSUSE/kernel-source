Subject: [PATCH v5 2/3] mm/util.c: make vm_memory_committed() more accurate
Date: Sun, 21 Jun 2020 15:36:39 +0800
Patch-mainline: not yet (slipped through cracks)
References: bnc#1173271

percpu_counter_sum_positive() will provide more accurate info.

As with percpu_counter_read_positive(), in worst case the deviation
could be 'batch * nr_cpus', which is totalram_pages/256 for now,
and will be more when the batch gets enlarged.

Its time cost is about 800 nanoseconds on a 2C/4T platform and 2~3
microseconds on a 2S/36C/72T Skylake server in normal case, and in
worst case where vm_committed_as's spinlock is under severe
contention, it costs 30~40 microseconds for the 2S/36C/72T Skylake
sever, which should be fine for its only two users: /proc/meminfo
and HyperV balloon driver's status trace per second.
