Subject: scsi: lpfc: Fix shost refcount mismatch when deleting vport
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jejb/scsi.git
Git-commit: 03dbfe0668e6692917ac278883e0586cd7f7d753
References: bsc#1172687 bsc#1171530 

When vports are deleted, it is observed that there is memory/kthread
leakage as the vport isn't fully being released.

There is a shost reference taken in scsi_add_host_dma that is not released
during scsi_remove_host. It was noticed that other drivers resolve this by
doing a scsi_host_put after calling scsi_remove_host.

The vport_delete routine is taking two references one that corresponds to
an access to the scsi_host in the vport_delete routine and another that is
released after the adapter mailbox command completes that destroys the VPI
that corresponds to the vport.

Remove one of the references taken such that the second reference that is
put will complete the missing scsi_add_host_dma reference and the shost
will be terminated.
