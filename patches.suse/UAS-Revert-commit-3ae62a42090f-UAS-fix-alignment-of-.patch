Subject: [PATCH] UAS: Revert commit 3ae62a42090f ("UAS: fix alignment of scatter/gather segments")
Git-commit: 1186f86a71130a7635a20843e355bb880c7349b2
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc6
References: git-fixes bnc#1151927 5.3.9

Commit 3ae62a42090f ("UAS: fix alignment of scatter/gather segments"),
copying a similar commit for usb-storage, attempted to solve a problem
involving scatter-gather I/O and USB/IP by setting the
virt_boundary_mask for mass-storage devices.

However, it now turns out that the analogous change in usb-storage
interacted badly with commit 09324d32d2a0 ("block: force an unlimited
segment size on queues with a virt boundary"), which was added later.
A typical error message is:

	ehci-pci 0000:00:13.2: swiotlb buffer is full (sz: 327680 bytes),
	total 32768 (slots), used 97 (slots)

There is no longer any reason to keep the virt_boundary_mask setting
in the uas driver.  It was needed in the first place only for
handling devices with a block size smaller than the maxpacket size and
where the host controller was not capable of fully general
scatter-gather operation (that is, able to merge two SG segments into
a single USB packet).  But:

	High-speed or slower connections never use a bulk maxpacket
	value larger than 512;

	The SCSI layer does not handle block devices with a block size
	smaller than 512 bytes;

	All the host controllers capable of SuperSpeed operation can
	handle fully general SG;

	Since commit ea44d190764b ("usbip: Implement SG support to
	vhci-hcd and stub driver") was merged, the USB/IP driver can
	also handle SG.

Therefore all supported device/controller combinations should be okay
with no need for any special virt_boundary_mask.  So in order to head
off potential problems similar to those affecting usb-storage, this
patch reverts commit 3ae62a42090f.
