Subject: tcp_cubic: fix spurious HYSTART_DELAY exit upon drop in min RTT
Git-commit: b344579ca8478598937215f7005d6c7b84d28aee
Patch-mainline: 5.8-rc3
References: networking-stable-20_06_28

Mirja Kuehlewind reported a bug in Linux TCP CUBIC Hystart, where
Hystart HYSTART_DELAY mechanism can exit Slow Start spuriously on an
ACK when the minimum rtt of a connection goes down. From inspection it
is clear from the existing code that this could happen in an example
like the following:

o The first 8 RTT samples in a round trip are 150ms, resulting in a
  curr_rtt of 150ms and a delay_min of 150ms.

o The 9th RTT sample is 100ms. The curr_rtt does not change after the
  first 8 samples, so curr_rtt remains 150ms. But delay_min can be
  lowered at any time, so delay_min falls to 100ms. The code executes
  the HYSTART_DELAY comparison between curr_rtt of 150ms and delay_min
  of 100ms, and the curr_rtt is declared far enough above delay_min to
  force a (spurious) exit of Slow start.

The fix here is simple: allow every RTT sample in a round trip to
lower the curr_rtt.
