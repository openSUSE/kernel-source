Subject: [PATCH 14/45] arm64: erratum: Work around Falkor erratum #E1003 in
 trampoline code

Git-commit: d1777e686ad10ba7c594304429c6045fb79255a1
Patch-mainline: Queued
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git
References: bsc#1068032

We rely on an atomic swizzling of TTBR1 when transitioning from the entry
trampoline to the kernel proper on an exception. We can't rely on this
atomicity in the face of Falkor erratum #E1003, so on affected cores we
can issue a TLB invalidation to invalidate the walk cache prior to
jumping into the kernel. There is still the possibility of a TLB conflict
here due to conflicting walk cache entries prior to the invalidation, but
this doesn't appear to be the case on these CPUs in practice.

 	  On Falkor v1, an incorrect ASID may be cached in the TLB when ASID
-	  and BADDR are changed together in TTBRx_EL1. The workaround for this

-	  switching to the new ASID. Saying Y here selects ARM64_PAN if
-	  ARM64_SW_TTBR0_PAN is selected. This is done because implementing and
-	  maintaining the E1003 workaround in the software PAN emulation code
-	  would be an unnecessary complication. The affected Falkor v1 CPU
-	  implements ARMv8.1 hardware PAN support and using hardware PAN
-	  support versus software PAN emulation is mutually exclusive at

+	  and BADDR are changed together in TTBRx_EL1. Since we keep the ASID
+	  in TTBR1_EL1, this situation only occurs in the entry trampoline and
+	  then only for entries in the walk cache, since the leaf translation
+	  is unchanged. Work around the erratum by invalidating the walk cache
+	  entries for the trampoline before entering the kernel proper.
