Subject: tls: Fix context leak on tls_device_down
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc7
Git-commit: 3740651bf7e200109dd42d5b2fb22226b26f960a
References: bsc#1221545

The commit cited below claims to fix a use-after-free condition after
tls_device_down. Apparently, the description wasn't fully accurate. The
context stayed alive, but ctx->netdev became NULL, and the offload was
torn down without a proper fallback, so a bug was present, but a
different kind of bug.

Due to misunderstanding of the issue, the original patch dropped the
refcount_dec_and_test line for the context to avoid the alleged
premature deallocation. That line has to be restored, because it matches
the refcount_inc_not_zero from the same function, otherwise the contexts
that survived tls_device_down are leaked.

This patch fixes the described issue by restoring refcount_dec_and_test.
After this change, there is no leak anymore, and the fallback to
software kTLS still works.
