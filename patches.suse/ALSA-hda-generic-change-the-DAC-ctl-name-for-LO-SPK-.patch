Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda: generic: change the DAC ctl name for LO+SPK or LO+HP
Git-commit: f48652bbe3ae62ba2835a396b7e01f063e51c4cd
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc1
References: git-fixes

Without this change, the DAC ctl's name could be changed only when
the machine has both Speaker and Headphone, but we met some machines
which only has Lineout and Headhpone, and the Lineout and Headphone
share the Audio Mixer0 and DAC0, the ctl's name is set to "Front".

On most of machines, the "Front" is used for Speaker only or Lineout
only, but on this machine it is shared by Lineout and Headphone,
This introduces an issue in the pipewire and pulseaudio, suppose users
want the Headphone to be on and the Speaker/Lineout to be off, they
could turn off the "Front", this works on most of the machines, but on
this machine, the "Front" couldn't be turned off otherwise the
headphone will be off too. Here we do some change to let the ctl's
name change to "Headphone+LO" on this machine, and pipewire and
pulseaudio already could handle "Headphone+LO" and "Speaker+LO".
