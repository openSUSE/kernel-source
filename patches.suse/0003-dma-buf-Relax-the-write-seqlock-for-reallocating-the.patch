Subject: dma-buf: Relax the write-seqlock for reallocating the shared fence
 list
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: 30fe7b07f6cb7f391181eb9d2ea2687cd9bcf395
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: bsc#1152472

As the set of shared fences is not being changed during reallocation of
the reservation list, we can skip updating the write_seqlock.
