Subject: [PATCH] dax: fix ENOMEM handling in grab_mapping_entry()
Git-commit: 1a14e3779dd58c16b30e56558146e5cc850ba8b0
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc1
References: bsc#1184212

grab_mapping_entry() has a bug in handling of ENOMEM condition.  Suppose
we have a PMD entry at index i which we are downgrading to a PTE entry.
grab_mapping_entry() will set pmd_downgrade to true, lock the entry, clear
the entry in xarray, and decrement mapping->nrpages.  The it will call:

	entry = dax_make_entry(pfn_to_pfn_t(0), flags);
	dax_lock_entry(xas, entry);

which inserts new PTE entry into xarray.  However this may fail allocating
the new node.  We handle this by:

	if (xas_nomem(xas, mapping_gfp_mask(mapping) & ~__GFP_HIGHMEM))
		goto retry;

however pmd_downgrade stays set to true even though 'entry' returned from
get_unlocked_entry() will be NULL now.  And we will go again through the
downgrade branch.  This is mostly harmless except that mapping->nrpages is
decremented again and we temporarily have an invalid entry stored in
xarray.  Fix the problem by setting pmd_downgrade to false each time we
lookup the entry we work with so that it matches the entry we found.
