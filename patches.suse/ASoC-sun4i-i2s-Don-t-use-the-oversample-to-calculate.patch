Subject: ASoC: sun4i-i2s: Don't use the oversample to calculate BCLK
Git-commit: 7df8f9a20196072162d9dc8fe99943f2d35f23d5
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.4

The BCLK divider should be calculated using the parameters that actually
make the BCLK rate: the number of channels, the sampling rate and the
sample width.

We've been using the oversample_rate previously because in the former SoCs,
the BCLK's parent is MCLK, which in turn is being used to generate the
oversample rate, so we end up with something like this:

oversample = mclk_rate / sampling_rate
bclk_div = oversample / word_size / channels

So, bclk_div = mclk_rate / sampling_rate / word_size / channels.

And this is actually better, since the oversampling ratio only plays a role
because the MCLK is its parent, not because of what BCLK is supposed to be.

Furthermore, that assumption of MCLK being the parent has been broken on
newer SoCs, so let's use the proper formula, and have the parent rate as an
argument.
