Subject: arm64: smp: Treat unknown boot failures as being 'stuck in kernel'
Git-commit: ebef746543fd1aa162216b0e484eb9062b65741d
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: bsc#1170680

When we fail to bring a secondary CPU online and it fails in an unknown
state, we should assume the worst and increment 'cpus_stuck_in_kernel'
so that things like kexec() are disabled.
