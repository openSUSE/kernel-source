Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: fix space cache memory leak after transaction abort
References: bsc#1178173

If a transaction aborts it can cause a memory leak of the pages array of
a block group's io_ctl structure. The following steps explain how that can
happen:

1) Transaction N is committing, currently in state TRANS_STATE_UNBLOCKED
   and it's about to start writing out dirty extent buffers;

2) Transaction N + 1 already started and another task, task A, just called
   btrfs_commit_transaction() on it;

3) Block group B was dirtied (extents allocated from it) by transaction
   N + 1, so when task A calls btrfs_start_dirty_block_groups(), at the
   very beginning of the transaction commit, it starts writeback for the
   block group's space cache by calling btrfs_write_out_cache(), which
   allocates the pages array for the block group's io_ctl with a call to
   io_ctl_init(). Block group A is added to the io_list of transaction
   N + 1 by btrfs_start_dirty_block_groups();

4) While transaction N's commit is writing out the extent buffers, it gets
   an IO error and aborts transaction N, also setting the file system to
   RO mode;

5) Task A has already returned from btrfs_start_dirty_block_groups(), is at
   btrfs_commit_transaction() and has set transaction N + 1 state to
   TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_START. Immediately after that it checks that the
   filesystem was turned to RO mode, due to transaction N's abort, and
   jumps to the "cleanup_transaction" label. After that we end up at
   btrfs_cleanup_one_transaction() which calls btrfs_cleanup_dirty_bgs().
   That helper finds block group B in the transaction's io_list but it
   never releases the pages array of the block group's io_ctl, resulting in
   a memory leak.

In fact at the point when we are at btrfs_cleanup_dirty_bgs(), the pages
array points to pages that were already released by us at
__btrfs_write_out_cache() through the call to io_ctl_drop_pages(). We end
up freeing the pages array only after waiting for the ordered extent to
complete through btrfs_wait_cache_io(), which calls io_ctl_free() to do
that. But in the transaction abort case we don't wait for the space cache's
ordered extent to complete through a call to btrfs_wait_cache_io(), so
that's why we end up with a memory leak - we wait for the ordered extent
to complete indirectly by shutting down the work queues and waiting for
any jobs in them to complete before returning from close_ctree().

We can solve the leak simply by freeing the pages array right after
releasing the pages (with the call to io_ctl_drop_pages()) at
__btrfs_write_out_cache(), since we will never use it anymore after that
and the pages array points to already released pages at that point, which
is currently not a problem since no one will use it after that, but not a
good practice anyway since it can easily lead to use-after-free issues.

So fix this by freeing the pages array right after releasing the pages at
__btrfs_write_out_cache().

This issue can often be reproduced with test case generic/475 from fstests
and kmemleak can detect it and reports it with the following trace:
