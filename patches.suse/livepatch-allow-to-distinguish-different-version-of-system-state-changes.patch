Subject: livepatch: Allow to distinguish different version of system state
 changes
Git-commit: 92c9abf5e57500ea7dc59a55273aa7850b631bda
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: bsc#1071995 fate#323487

The atomic replace runs pre/post (un)install callbacks only from the new
livepatch. There are several reasons for this:

  + Simplicity: clear ordering of operations, no interactions between
	old and new callbacks.

  + Reliability: only new livepatch knows what changes can already be made
	by older livepatches and how to take over the state.

  + Testing: the atomic replace can be properly tested only when a newer
	livepatch is available. It might be too late to fix unwanted effect
	of callbacks from older	livepatches.

It might happen that an older change is not enough and the same system
state has to be modified another way. Different changes need to get
distinguished by a version number added to struct klp_state.

The version can also be used to prevent loading incompatible livepatches.
The check is done when the livepatch is enabled. The rules are:

  + Any completely new system state modification is allowed.

  + System state modifications with the same or higher version are allowed
    for already modified system states.

  + Cumulative livepatches must handle all system state modifications from
    already installed livepatches.

  + Non-cumulative livepatches are allowed to touch already modified
    system states.
