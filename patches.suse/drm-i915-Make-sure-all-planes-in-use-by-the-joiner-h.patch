Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: Make sure all planes in use by the joiner have their crtc included

Any active plane needs to have its crtc included in the atomic
state. For planes enabled via uapi that is all handler in the core.
But when we use a plane for joiner the uapi code things the plane
is disabled and therefore doesn't have a crtc. So we need to pull
those in by hand. We do it first thing in
intel_joiner_add_affected_crtcs() so that any newly added crtc will
subsequently pull in all of its joined crtcs as well.

The symptoms from failing to do this are:
- duct tape in the form of commit 1d5b09f8daf8 ("drm/i915: Fix NULL
  ptr deref by checking new_crtc_state")
- the plane's hw state will get overwritten by the disabled
  uapi state if it can't find the uapi counterpart plane in
  the atomic state from where it should copy the correct state
