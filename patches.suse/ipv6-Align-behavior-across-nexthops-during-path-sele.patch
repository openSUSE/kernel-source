Subject: ipv6: Align behavior across nexthops during path selection
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc2
Git-commit: 6933cd4714861eea6848f18396a119d741f25fc3
References: git-fixes

A nexthop is only chosen when the calculated multipath hash falls in the
nexthop's hash region (i.e., the hash is smaller than the nexthop's hash
threshold) and when the nexthop is assigned a non-negative score by
rt6_score_route().

Commit 4d0ab3a6885e ("ipv6: Start path selection from the first
nexthop") introduced an unintentional difference between the first
nexthop and the rest when the score is negative.

When the first nexthop matches, but has a negative score, the code will
currently evaluate subsequent nexthops until one is found with a
non-negative score. On the other hand, when a different nexthop matches,
but has a negative score, the code will fallback to the nexthop with
which the selection started ('match').

Align the behavior across all nexthops and fallback to 'match' when the
first nexthop matches, but has a negative score.

Fixes: 3d709f69a3e7 ("ipv6: Use hash-threshold instead of modulo-N")
Fixes: 4d0ab3a6885e ("ipv6: Start path selection from the first nexthop")
