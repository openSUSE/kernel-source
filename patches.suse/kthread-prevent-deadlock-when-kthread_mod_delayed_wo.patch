Subject: [PATCH] kthread: prevent deadlock when kthread_mod_delayed_work()
 races with kthread_cancel_delayed_work_sync()
Git-commit: 5fa54346caf67b4b1b10b1f390316ae466da4d53
Patch-mainline: v5.13
References: bsc#1187867

The system might hang with the following backtrace:

	vfs_write+0x2f4/0x368

It is caused by the following race between kthread_mod_delayed_work()
and kthread_cancel_delayed_work_sync():

CPU0				CPU1

Context: Thread A		Context: Thread B

kthread_mod_delayed_work()
  spin_lock()
  __kthread_cancel_work()
     spin_unlock()
     del_timer_sync()
				kthread_cancel_delayed_work_sync()
				  spin_lock()
				  __kthread_cancel_work()
				    spin_unlock()
				    del_timer_sync()
				    spin_lock()

				  work->canceling++
				  spin_unlock
     spin_lock()
   queue_delayed_work()
     // dwork is put into the worker->delayed_work_list

   spin_unlock()

				  kthread_flush_work()
     // flush_work is put at the tail of the dwork

				    wait_for_completion()

Context: IRQ

  kthread_delayed_work_timer_fn()
    spin_lock()
    list_del_init(&work->node);
    spin_unlock()

Bang: flush_work is not longer linked and will never get proceed.

The problem is that kthread_mod_delayed_work() checks work->canceling
flag before canceling the timer.

A simple solution is to (re)check work->canceling after
__kthread_cancel_work().  But then it is not clear what should be
returned when __kthread_cancel_work() removed the work from the queue
(list) and it can't queue it again with the new @delay.

The return value might be used for reference counting.  The caller has
to know whether a new work has been queued or an existing one was
replaced.

The proper solution is that kthread_mod_delayed_work() will remove the
work from the queue (list) _only_ when work->canceling is not set.  The
flag must be checked after the timer is stopped and the remaining
operations can be done under worker->lock.

Note that kthread_mod_delayed_work() could remove the timer and then
bail out.  It is fine.  The other canceling caller needs to cancel the
timer as well.  The important thing is that the queue (list)
manipulation is done atomically under worker->lock.
