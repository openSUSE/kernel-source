Subject: perf list: Add IBM z17 event descriptions
Git-commit: 508b228942b291cb69f11027c07ca17ab2ac03bc
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc1
References: jsc#PED-13611

Update IBM z17 counter description using document SA23-2260-08:
"The Load-Program-Parameter and the CPU-Measurement Facilities"
released in May 2025 to include counter definitions for IBM z17
counter sets:
* Basic counter set
* Problem/user counter set
* Crypto counter set.

Use document SA23-2261-09:
"The CPU-Measurement Facility Extended Counters Definition
 for z10, z196/z114, zEC12/zBC12, z13/z13s, z14, z15, z16 and z17"
released on April 2025 to include counter definitions for IBM z17
* Extended counter set
* MT-Diagnostic counter set.

Use document SA22-7832-14:
"z/Architecture Principles of Operation."
released in April 2025 to include counter definitions for IBM z17
* PAI-Crypto counter set
* PAI-Extention counter set.

Use document
"CPU MF Formulas and Updates April 2025"
released in April 2025 to include metric calculations.
