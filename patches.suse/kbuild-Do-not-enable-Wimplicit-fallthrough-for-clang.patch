Subject: kbuild: Do not enable -Wimplicit-fallthrough for clang for now
Git-commit: e2079e93f562c7f7a030eb7642017ee5eabaaa10
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.5

This functionally reverts commit bfd77145f35c ("Makefile: Convert
-Wimplicit-fallthrough=3 to just -Wimplicit-fallthrough for clang").

clang enabled support for -Wimplicit-fallthrough in C in r369414 [1],
which causes a lot of warnings when building the kernel for two reasons:

1. Clang does not support the /* fall through */ comments. There seems
   to be a general consensus in the LLVM community that this is not
   something they want to support. Joe Perches wrote a script to convert
   all of the comments to a "fallthrough" keyword that will be added to
   compiler_attributes.h [2] [3], which catches the vast majority of the
   comments. There doesn't appear to be any consensus in the kernel
   community when to do this conversion.

2. Clang and GCC disagree about falling through to final case statements
   with no content or cases that simply break:

   https://godbolt.org/z/c8csDu

   This difference contributes at least 50 warnings in an allyesconfig
   build for x86, not considering other architectures. This difference
   will need to be discussed to see which compiler is right [4] [5].

[5]: https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/linux/issues/636

Given these two problems need discussion and coordination, do not enable
-Wimplicit-fallthrough with clang right now. Add a comment to explain
what is going on as well. This commit should be reverted once these two
issues are fully flushed out and resolved.
