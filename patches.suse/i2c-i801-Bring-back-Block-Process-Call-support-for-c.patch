Subject: [PATCH] i2c: i801: Bring back Block Process Call support for certain platforms
Git-commit: fd4b204a0971854c35795ab60b3673a5b57dfebc
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-7946

Commit b84398d6d7f9 ("i2c: i801: Use iTCO version 6 in Cannon Lake PCH
and beyond") looks like to drop by accident Block Write-Block Read Process
Call support for Intel Sunrisepoint, Lewisburg, Denverton and Kaby Lake.

That support was added for above and newer platforms by the commit
315cd67c9453 ("i2c: i801: Add Block Write-Block Read Process Call
support") so bring it back for above platforms.

Fixes: b84398d6d7f9 ("i2c: i801: Use iTCO version 6 in Cannon Lake PCH and beyond")
