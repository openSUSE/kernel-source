Subject: [PATCH] cifs: add WARN_ON for when chan_count goes below minimum
Git-commit: 2e0fa298d149e07005504350358066f380f72b52
References: bsc#1193629
Patch-mainline: v5.16

chan_count keeps track of the total number of channels.
Since at least the primary channel will always be connected,
this value can never go below 1. Warn if that happens.
