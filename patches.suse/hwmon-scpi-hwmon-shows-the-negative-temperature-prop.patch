Subject: [PATCH] hwmon: (scpi-hwmon) shows the negative temperature properly
Git-commit: 78d13552346289bad4a9bf8eabb5eec5e5a321a5
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc6
References: git-fixes

The scpi hwmon shows the sub-zero temperature in an unsigned integer,
which would confuse the users when the machine works in low temperature
environment. This shows the sub-zero temperature in an signed value and
users can get it properly from sensors.
