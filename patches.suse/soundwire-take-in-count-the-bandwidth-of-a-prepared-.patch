Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: take in count the bandwidth of a prepared stream
Git-commit: 08ae0d61c3d79bb5d52ae30ad4fc12442e966a23
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc1
References: jsc#PED-14430 jsc#PED-14297 jsc#PED-14024

When a stream's state is marked as prepared, it is ready for
playback/capture. Therefore, we need to include the stream's bandwidth
when we calculate the required bandwidth of a bus.
