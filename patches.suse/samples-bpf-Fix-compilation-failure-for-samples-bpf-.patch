Subject: samples/bpf: Fix compilation failure for samples/bpf on LoongArch
 Fedora
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc4

References: git-fixes

When building the latest samples/bpf on LoongArch Fedora

     make M=samples/bpf

There are compilation errors as follows:

In file included from ./linux/samples/bpf/sockex2_kern.c:2:
In file included from ./include/uapi/linux/in.h:25:
In file included from ./include/linux/socket.h:8:

./arch/loongarch/include/asm/loongarch.h:13:10: fatal error: 'larchintrin.h' file not found
         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1 error generated.

larchintrin.h is included in /usr/lib64/clang/14.0.6/include,
and the header file location is specified at compile time.
