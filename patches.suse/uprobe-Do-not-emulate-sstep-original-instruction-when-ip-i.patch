Subject: uprobe: Do not emulate/sstep original instruction when ip is changed
Git-commit: 4363264111e1297fa37aa39b0598faa19298ecca
Patch-mainline: v6.18-rc1
References: git-fixes

If uprobe handler changes instruction pointer we still execute single
step) or emulate the original instruction and increment the (new) ip
with its length.

This makes the new instruction pointer bogus and application will
likely crash on illegal instruction execution.

If user decided to take execution elsewhere, it makes little sense
to execute the original instruction, so let's skip it.
