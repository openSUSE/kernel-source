Subject: [PATCH] xfs: fix imprecise logic in xchk_btree_check_block_owner
Git-commit: c0afba9a8363f17d4efed22a8764df33389aebe8
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc7
References: git-fixes

A reviewer was confused by the init_sa logic in this function.  Upon
checking the logic, I discovered that the code is imprecise.  What we
want to do here is check that there is an ownership record in the rmap
btree for the AG that contains a btree block.

For an inode-rooted btree (e.g. the bmbt) the per-AG btree cursors have
not been initialized because inode btrees can span multiple AGs.
Therefore, we must initialize the per-AG btree cursors in sc->sa before
proceeding.  That is what init_sa controls, and hence the logic should
be gated on XFS_BTREE_ROOT_IN_INODE, not XFS_BTREE_LONG_PTRS.

In practice, ROOT_IN_INODE and LONG_PTRS are coincident so this hasn't
mattered.  However, we're about to refactor both of those flags into
separate btree_ops fields so we want this the logic to make sense
afterwards.
