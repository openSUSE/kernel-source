Subject: s390: Kernel message catalog
Patch-mainline: never, S/390 specific
References: bnc#1053718, LTC#157660

Summary:     s390: Kernel message catalog
Description: Add support for automatic message tags to the printk macro
             families dev_xyz and pr_xyz. The message tag consists of a
             component name and a 24 bit hash of the message text. For
             each message that is documented in the included kernel message
             catalog a man page can be created with a script (which is
             included in the patch). The generated man pages contain
             explanatory text that is intended to help understand the
             messages.

             Note that only s390 specific messages are prepared
             appropriately and included in the generated message catalog.

             This patch is optional as it is very unlikely to be accepted
             in upstream kernel, but is recommended for all distributions
             which are built based on the 'Development stream'
