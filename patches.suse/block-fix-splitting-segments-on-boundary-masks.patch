Subject: [PATCH] block: fix splitting segments on boundary masks
Git-commit: 429120f3df2dba2bf3a4a19f4212a53ecefc7102
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc5
References: bsc#1163893

We ran into a problem with a mpt3sas based controller, where we would
see random (and hard to reproduce) file corruption). The issue seemed
specific to this controller, but wasn't specific to the file system.
After a lot of debugging, we find out that it's caused by segments
spanning a 4G memory boundary. This shouldn't happen, as the default
setting for segment boundary masks is 4G.

Turns out there are two issues in get_max_segment_size():

1) The default segment boundary mask is bypassed

2) The segment start address isn't taken into account when checking
   segment boundary limit

Fix these two issues by removing the bypass of the segment boundary
check even if the mask is set to the default value, and taking into
account the actual start address of the request when checking if a
segment needs splitting.

Dropped const on the page pointer, ppc page_to_phys() doesn't mark the
page as const...
