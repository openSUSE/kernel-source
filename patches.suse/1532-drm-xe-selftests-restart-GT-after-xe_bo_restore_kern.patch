Subject: drm/xe/selftests: restart GT after xe_bo_restore_kernel()
Git-commit: 5a142f9c675ab524a5f18457859ed2002507ea74
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: drm-backport-placeholder

Test seems to be failing badly after calling xe_bo_restore_kernel().
Taking a snapshot of the CTB and copying back a potentially old version
seems risky, depending on what might have been inflight. Also it seems
snapshotting the ADS object and copying back results in serious
breakage. Normally when calling xe_bo_restore_kernel() we always fully
restart the GT, which re-intializes such things.  We could potentially
skip saving and restoring such objects in xe_bo_evict_all() however
seems quite fragile not to also restart the GT. Try to do that here by
triggering a GT reset.
