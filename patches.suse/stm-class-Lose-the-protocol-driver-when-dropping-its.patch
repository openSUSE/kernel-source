Subject: [PATCH] stm class: Lose the protocol driver when dropping its reference
Git-commit: 0a8f72fafb3f72a08df4ee491fcbeaafd6de85fd
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: git-fixes

Commit c7fd62bc69d02 ("stm class: Introduce framing protocol drivers")
forgot to tear down the link between an stm device and its protocol
driver when policy is removed. This leads to an invalid pointer reference
if one tries to write to an stm device after the policy has been removed
and the protocol driver module unloaded, leading to the below splat:

Fix this by tearing down the link from an stm device to its protocol
driver when the policy involving that driver is removed.
