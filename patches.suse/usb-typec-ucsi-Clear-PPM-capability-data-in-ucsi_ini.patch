Subject: [PATCH] usb: typec: ucsi: Clear PPM capability data in ucsi_init() error path
Git-commit: f247f0a82a4f8c3bfed178d8fd9e069d1424ee4e
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc6
References: git-fixes

If ucsi_init() fails for some reason (e.g. ucsi_register_port()
fails or general communication failure to the PPM), particularly at
any point after the GET_CAPABILITY command had been issued, this
results in unwinding the initialization and returning an error.
However the ucsi structure's ucsi_capability member retains its
current value, including likely a non-zero num_connectors.
And because ucsi_init() itself is done in a workqueue a UCSI
interface driver will be unaware that it failed and may think the
ucsi_register() call was completely successful.  Later, if
ucsi_unregister() is called, due to this stale ucsi->cap value it
would try to access the items in the ucsi->connector array which
might not be in a proper state or not even allocated at all and
results in NULL or invalid pointer dereference.

Fix this by clearing the ucsi->cap value to 0 during the error
path of ucsi_init() in order to prevent a later ucsi_unregister()
from entering the connector cleanup loop.
