Subject: [PATCH] NFS4: Fix state renewals missing after boot
Git-commit: 9bb3baa9d1604cd20f49ae7dac9306b4037a0e7a
Patch-mainline: v6.18-rc2
References: git-fixes

Since the last renewal time was initialized to 0 and jiffies start
counting at -5 minutes, any clients connected in the first 5 minutes
after a reboot would have their renewal timer set to a very long
interval. If the connection was idle, this would result in the client
state timing out on the server and the next call to the server would
return NFS4ERR_BADSESSION.

Fix this by initializing the last renewal time to the current jiffies
instead of 0.
