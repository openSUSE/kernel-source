Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915/guc: Handle race condition where wakeref count drops below 0
Git-commit: 0323a5127e7c534cfc88efe0f850a0cb777e938b
Patch-mainline: v6.16-rc1
Alt-commit: f36a75aba1c3176d177964bca76f86a075d2943a
References: git-fixes

There is a rare race condition when preparing for a reset where
guc_lrc_desc_unpin() could be in the process of deregistering a context
while a different thread is scrubbing outstanding contexts and it alters
the context state and does a wakeref put. Then, if there is a failure
with deregister_context(), a second wakeref put could occur. As a result
the wakeref count could drop below 0 and fail an INTEL_WAKEREF_BUG_ON()
check.

Therefore if there is a failure with deregister_context(), undo the
context state changes and do a wakeref put only if the context was set
to be destroyed earlier.

V2: Expand comment to better explain change. (Daniele)
V3: Removed addition to the original comment. (Daniele)
