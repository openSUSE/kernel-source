Subject: [PATCH] dax: fix detection of dax support for non-persistent memory
 block devices
Git-commit: 6180bb446ab624b9ab8bf201ed251ca87f07b413
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc5
References: bsc#1175995, jsc#SLE-15608

When calling __generic_fsdax_supported(), a dax-unsupported device may
not have dax_dev as NULL, e.g. the dax related code block is not enabled
by Kconfig.

Therefore in __generic_fsdax_supported(), to check whether a device
supports DAX or not, the following order of operations should be
Performed: 
- If dax_dev pointer is NULL, it means the device driver explicitly
  announce it doesn't support DAX. Then it is OK to directly return
  false from __generic_fsdax_supported().
- If dax_dev pointer is NOT NULL, it might be because the driver doesn't
  support DAX and not explicitly initialize related data structure. Then
  bdev_dax_supported() should be called for further check.

If device driver desn't explicitly set its dax_dev pointer to NULL,
this is not a bug. Calling bdev_dax_supported() makes sure they can be
recognized as dax-unsupported eventually.
