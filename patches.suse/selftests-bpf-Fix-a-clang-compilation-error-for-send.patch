Subject: selftests/bpf: Fix a clang compilation error for send_signal.c
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
Git-commit: d3b351f65bf42ccda1f686de3ccb21ea1a0c4f5a
References: jsc#PED-1368

Building selftests/bpf with latest clang compiler (clang15 built
from source), I hit the following compilation error:

  /.../prog_tests/send_signal.c:43:16: error: variable 'j' set but not used [-Werror,-Wunused-but-set-variable]
                  volatile int j = 0;
                               ^
  1 error generated.

The problem also exists with clang13 and clang14. clang12 is okay.

In send_signal.c, we have the following code ...

  volatile int j = 0;
  [...]
  for (int i = 0; i < 100000000 && !sigusr1_received; i++)
    j /= i + 1;

... to burn CPU cycles so bpf_send_signal() helper can be tested
in NMI mode.

Slightly changing 'j /= i + 1' to 'j /= i + j + 1' or 'j++' can
fix the problem. Further investigation indicated this should be
a clang bug ([1]). The upstream fix will be proposed later. But it
is a good idea to workaround the issue to unblock people who build
kernel/selftests with clang.
