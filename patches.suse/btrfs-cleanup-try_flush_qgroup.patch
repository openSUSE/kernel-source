Subject: btrfs: Cleanup try_flush_qgroup
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc1
Git-commit: ae396a3b7ad00c0730ef0d08916525acd3853af5
References: bsc#1182047

It's no longer expected to call this function with an open transaction
so all the hacks concerning this can be removed. In fact it'll
constitute a bug to call this function with a transaction already held
so WARN in this case.
