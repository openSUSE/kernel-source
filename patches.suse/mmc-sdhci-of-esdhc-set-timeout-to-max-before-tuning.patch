Subject: [PATCH] mmc: sdhci-of-esdhc: set timeout to max before tuning
Git-commit: 0add6e9b88d0632a25323aaf4987dbacb0e4ae64
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc2

On rare occations there is the following error:

  mmc0: Tuning timeout, falling back to fixed sampling clock

There are SD cards which takes a significant longer time to reply to the
first CMD19 command. The eSDHC takes the data timeout value into account
during the tuning period. The SDHCI core doesn't explicitly set this
timeout for the tuning procedure. Thus on the slow cards, there might be
a spurious "Buffer Read Ready" interrupt, which in turn triggers a wrong
sequence of events. In the end this will lead to an unsuccessful tuning
procedure and to the above error.

To workaround this, set the timeout to the maximum value (which is the
best we can do) and the SDHCI core will take care of the proper timeout
handling.
