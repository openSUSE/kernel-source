Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/bpf: Fix tail call implementation

References: bsc#1157698 bnc#1151927 5.3.15
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc7
Git-commit: 7de086909365cd60a5619a45af3f4152516fd75c

We have seen many crashes on powerpc hosts while loading bpf programs.

The problem here is that bpf_int_jit_compile() does a first pass
to compute the program length.

Then it allocates memory to store the generated program and
calls bpf_jit_build_body() a second time (and a third time
later)

What I have observed is that the second bpf_jit_build_body()
could end up using few more words than expected.

If bpf_jit_binary_alloc() put the space for the program
at the end of the allocated page, we then write on
a non mapped memory.

It appears that bpf_jit_emit_tail_call() calls
bpf_jit_emit_common_epilogue() while ctx->seen might not
be stable.

Only after the second pass we can be sure ctx->seen wont be changed.

Trying to avoid a second pass seems quite complex and probably
not worth it.
