Subject: [PATCH] fs: no need to check source
Git-commit: 66d8fc0539b0d49941f313c9509a8384e4245ac1
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc1
References: bsc#1221044 CVE-2023-52591

The @source inode must be valid. It is even checked via IS_SWAPFILE()
above making it pretty clear. So no need to check it when we unlock.

What doesn't need to exist is the @target inode. The lock_two_inodes()
helper currently swaps the @inode1 and @inode2 arguments if @inode1 is
NULL to have consistent lock class usage. However, we know that at least
for vfs_rename() that @inode1 is @source and thus is never NULL as per
above. We also know that @source is a different inode than @target as
that is checked right at the beginning of vfs_rename(). So we know that
@source is valid and locked and that @target is locked. So drop the
check whether @source is non-NULL.
