Subject: [PATCH] md/raid1: set max_sectors during early return from
 choose_slow_rdev()
Git-commit: 36a5c03f232719eb4e2d925f4d584e09cfaf372c
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
References: git-fixes

Linux 6.9+ is unable to start a degraded RAID1 array with one drive,
when that drive has a write-mostly flag set. During such an attempt,
the following assertion in bio_split() is hit:

	BUG_ON(sectors <= 0);

Call Trace:
	? bio_split+0x96/0xb0
	? exc_invalid_op+0x53/0x70
	? bio_split+0x96/0xb0

	submit_bio_noacct_nocheck+0x18e/0x3c0
	submit_bio_noacct+0x244/0x670

After investigation, it turned out that choose_slow_rdev() does not set
the value of max_sectors in some cases and because of it,
raid1_read_request calls bio_split with sectors == 0.

Fix it by filling in this variable.

This bug was introduced in
commit dfa8ecd167c1 ("md/raid1: factor out choose_slow_rdev() from read_balance()")
but apparently hidden until
commit 0091c5a269ec ("md/raid1: factor out helpers to choose the best rdev from read_balance()")
shortly thereafter.

Tested on both Linux 6.10 and 6.9.8.

Inside a VM, mdadm testsuite for RAID1 on 6.10 did not find any problems:
	./test --dev=loop --no-error --raidtype=raid1
(on 6.9.8 there was one failure, caused by external bitmap support not
compiled in).

Notes: 
- I was reliably getting deadlocks when adding / removing devices
  on such an array - while the array was loaded with fsstress with 20
  concurrent processes. When the array was idle or loaded with fsstress
  with 8 processes, no such deadlocks happened in my tests.
  This occurred also on unpatched Linux 6.8.0 though, but not on
  6.1.97-rc1, so this is likely an independent regression (to be
  investigated).
- I was also getting deadlocks when adding / removing the bitmap on the
  array in similar conditions - this happened on Linux 6.1.97-rc1
  also though. fsstress with 8 concurrent processes did cause it only
  once during many tests.
- in my testing, there was once a problem with hot adding an
  internal bitmap to the array:
	mdadm: Cannot add bitmap while array is resyncing or reshaping etc.
	mdadm: failed to set internal bitmap.
  even though no such reshaping was happening according to /proc/mdstat.
  This seems unrelated, though.
