Subject: libbpf: Fix section counting logic
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
Git-commit: 0d6988e16a12ebd41d3e268992211b0ceba44ed7
References: jsc#PED-1368

e_shnum does include section #0 and as such is exactly the number of ELF
sections that we need to allocate memory for to use section indices as
array indices. Fix the off-by-one error.

This is purely accounting fix, previously we were overallocating one
too many array items. But no correctness errors otherwise.

Fixes: 25bbbd7a444b ("libbpf: Remove assumptions about uniqueness of .rodata/.data/.bss maps")
