Subject: drm/xe/mocs: Bring comment about mocs back to reality
Git-commit: 4399e95102edfceb7a7dd7eb72cd27b776e7d38b
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: drm-backport-placeholder

The mocs documentation was copied from i915 and doesn't match the
reality in xe. Reword it so it matches what the code is doing.
