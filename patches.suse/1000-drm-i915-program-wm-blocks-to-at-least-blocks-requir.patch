Subject: drm/i915: program wm blocks to at least blocks required per line
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Git-commit: b962a068347533e72ddb60ace6d649a5b974485b
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

In configurations with single DRAM channel, for usecases like
4K 60 Hz, FIFO underruns are observed quite frequently. Looks
like the wm0 watermark values need to bumped up because the wm0
memory latency calculations are probably not taking the DRAM
channel's impact into account.

As per the Bspec 49325, if the ddb allocation can hold at least
one plane_blocks_per_line we should have selected method2.
Assuming that modern HW versions have enough dbuf to hold
at least one line, set the wm blocks to equivalent to blocks
per line.
