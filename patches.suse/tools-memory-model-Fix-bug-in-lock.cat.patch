Subject: [PATCH] tools/memory-model: Fix bug in lock.cat
Git-commit: 4c830eef806679dc243e191f962c488dd9d00708
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
References: git-fixes

Andrea reported that the following innocuous litmus test:

C T

{}

P0(spinlock_t *x)
{
	int r0;

	spin_lock(x);
	spin_unlock(x);
	r0 = spin_is_locked(x);
}

gives rise to a nonsensical empty result with no executions:

$ herd7 -conf linux-kernel.cfg T.litmus
Test T Required
States 0
Ok
Witnesses
Positive: 0 Negative: 0
Condition forall (true)
Observation T Never 0 0
Time T 0.00
Hash=6fa204e139ddddf2cb6fa963bad117c0

The problem is caused by a bug in the lock.cat part of the LKMM.  Its
computation of the rf relation for RU (read-unlocked) events is
faulty; it implicitly assumes that every RU event must read from
either a UL (unlock) event in another thread or from the lock's
initial state.  Neither is true in the litmus test above, so the
computation yields no possible executions.

The lock.cat code tries to make up for this deficiency by allowing RU
events outside of critical sections to read from the last po-previous
UL event.  But it does this incorrectly, trying to keep these rfi links
separate from the rfe links that might also be needed, and passing only
the latter to herd7's cross() macro.

The problem is fixed by merging the two sets of possible rf links for
RU events and using them all in the call to cross().
