Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: soc-component: Add legacy_dai_naming flag
Git-commit: 1c348f748b4dd7711c5564a8fce0842529498dff
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: jsc#PED-850

Historically, the legacy DAI naming scheme was applied to platform
drivers and the newer scheme to CODEC drivers. During componentisation
the core lost the knowledge of if a driver was a CODEC or platform, they
were all now components. To continue to support the legacy naming on
older platform drivers a flag was added to the snd_soc_component_driver
structure, non_legacy_dai_naming, to indicate to use the new scheme and
this was applied to all CODECs as part of the migration.

However, a slight issue appears to be developing with respect to this
flag being opt in for the non-legacy scheme, which presumably we want to
be the primary scheme used. Many codec drivers appear to forget to
include this flag:

  grep -l -r "snd_soc_component_driver" sound/soc/codecs/*.c |
  xargs grep -L "non_legacy_dai_naming" | wc
     48      48    556

It would seem more sensible to change the flag to legacy_dai_naming
making the new scheme opt out. As a first step this patch adds a new
flag for this so that the users can be updated.
