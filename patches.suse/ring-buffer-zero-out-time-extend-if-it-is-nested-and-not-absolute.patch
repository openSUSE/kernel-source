Subject: ring-buffer: Zero out time extend if it is nested and not absolute
Git-commit: 097350d1c6e1f5808cae142006f18a0bbc57018d
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc3
References: git-fixes

Currently the ring buffer makes events that happen in interrupts that preempt
another event have a delta of zero. (Hopefully we can change this soon). But
this is to deal with the races of updating a global counter with lockless
and nesting functions updating deltas.

With the addition of absolute time stamps, the time extend didn't follow
this rule. A time extend can happen if two events happen longer than 2^27
nanoseconds appart, as the delta time field in each event is only 27 bits.
If that happens, then a time extend is injected with 2^59 bits of
nanoseconds to use (18 years). But if the 2^27 nanoseconds happen between
two events, and as it is writing the event, an interrupt triggers, it will
see the 2^27 difference as well and inject a time extend of its own. But a
recent change made the time extend logic not take into account the nesting,
and this can cause two time extend deltas to happen moving the time stamp
much further ahead than the current time. This gets all reset when the ring
buffer moves to the next page, but that can cause time to appear to go
backwards.

This was observed in a trace-cmd recording, and since the data is saved in a
file, with trace-cmd report --debug, it was possible to see that this indeed
did happen!
