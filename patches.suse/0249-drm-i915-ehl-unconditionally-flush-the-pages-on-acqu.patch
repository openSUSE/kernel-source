Subject: drm/i915/ehl: unconditionally flush the pages on acquire
Git-commit: 13d29c823738c0bcc72a631b8e6c3c5cb89090d6
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

EHL and JSL add the 'Bypass LLC' MOCS entry, which should make it
possible for userspace to bypass the GTT caching bits set by the kernel,
as per the given object cache_level. This is troublesome since the heavy
flush we apply when first acquiring the pages is skipped if the kernel
thinks the object is coherent with the GPU. As a result it might be
possible to bypass the cache and read the contents of the page directly,
which could be stale data. If it's just a case of userspace shooting
themselves in the foot then so be it, but since i915 takes the stance of
always zeroing memory before handing it to userspace, we need to prevent
this.

v2: this time actually set cache_dirty in put_pages()
v3: move to get_pages() which looks simpler
