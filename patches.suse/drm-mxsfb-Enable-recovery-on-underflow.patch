Subject: drm: mxsfb: Enable recovery on underflow
Git-commit: 0c9856e4edcdcac22d65618e8ceff9eb41447880
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

There is some sort of corner case behavior of the controller,
which could rarely be triggered at least on i.MX6SX connected
to 800x480 DPI panel and i.MX8MM connected to DPI->DSI->LVDS
bridged 1920x1080 panel (and likely on other setups too), where
the image on the panel shifts to the right and wraps around.
This happens either when the controller is enabled on boot or
even later during run time. The condition does not correct
itself automatically, i.e. the display image remains shifted.

It seems this problem is known and is due to sporadic underflows
of the LCDIF FIFO. While the LCDIF IP does have underflow/overflow
IRQs, neither of the IRQs trigger and neither IRQ status bit is
asserted when this condition occurs.

All known revisions of the LCDIF IP have CTRL1 RECOVER_ON_UNDERFLOW
bit, which is described in the reference manual since i.MX23 as
"
  Set this bit to enable the LCDIF block to recover in the next
  field/frame if there was an underflow in the current field/frame.
"
Enable this bit to mitigate the sporadic underflows.
