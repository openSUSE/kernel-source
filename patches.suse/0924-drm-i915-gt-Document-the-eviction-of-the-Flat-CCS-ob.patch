Capture the eviction details for Flat-CCS capable, lmem objects.

v2:
  Fix the Flat-ccs capbility of lmem obj with smem residency

- * When the object is referred, lmem content will be swaped in along with
- * restoration of the CCS data (using XY_CTRL_SURF_COPY_BLT) at corresponding
- * location.
+ * When we exhaust the lmem, Flat-CCS capable objects' lmem backing memory can
+ * be temporarily evicted to smem, along with the auxiliary CCS state, where
+ * it can be potentially swapped-out at a later point, if required.
+ * If userspace later touches the evicted pages, then we always move
+ * the backing memory back to lmem, which includes restoring the saved CCS state,
+ * and potentially performing any required swap-in.

+ * For the migration of the lmem objects with smem in placement list, such as
+ * {lmem, smem}, objects are treated as non Flat-CCS capable objects.
