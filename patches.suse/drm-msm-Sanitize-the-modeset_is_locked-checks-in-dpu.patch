Subject: [PATCH] drm/msm: Sanitize the modeset_is_locked checks in dpu
Git-commit: ab198a7aab65d6fcdbde082ff59a790dbf7e08f4
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: git-fixes

As Daniel mentions in his email [1], non-blocking commits don't hold the
modeset locks, so we can safely access state as long as these functions
are in the commit path. So remove the WARN_ON in dpu_kms_encoder_enable.

In dpu_crtc_get_intf_mode, things are a bit more complicated. So keep
the WARN_ON, but add a comment explaining the situation and hope someone
comes along and fixes the issue.

Link to v1: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/msgid/20191010151351.126735-1-sean@poorly.run

Changes in v2:
- Restored the WARN_ON in get_intf_mode and added a clarifying comment (Daniel)
