Subject: [PATCH] extcon: arizona: Fix various races on driver unbind
Git-commit: e5b499f6fb17bc95a813e85d0796522280203806
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc1
References: git-fixes

We must free/disable all interrupts and cancel all pending works
before doing further cleanup.

Before this commit arizona_extcon_remove() was doing several
register writes to shut things down before disabling the IRQs
and it was cancelling only 1 of the 3 different works used.

Move all the register-writes shutting things down to after
the disabling of the IRQs and add the 2 missing
cancel_delayed_work_sync() calls.

This fixes various possible races on driver unbind. One of which
would always trigger on devices using the mic-clamp feature for
jack detection. The ARIZONA_MICD_CLAMP_MODE_MASK update was
done before disabling the IRQs, causing:
1. arizona_jackdet() to run
2. detect a jack being inserted (clamp disabled means jack inserted)
3. call arizona_start_mic() which:
3.1 Enables the MICVDD regulator
3.2 takes a pm_runtime_reference

And this was all happening after the ARIZONA_MICD_ENA bit clearing,
which would undo 3.1 and 3.2 because the ARIZONA_MICD_CLAMP_MODE_MASK
update was being done after the ARIZONA_MICD_ENA bit clearing.

So this means that arizona_extcon_remove() would exit with
1. MICVDD enabled and 2. The pm_runtime_reference being unbalanced.

MICVDD still being enabled caused the following oops when the
regulator is released by the devm framework:

[ 2850.745757] ------------[ cut here ]------------

Note this oops is just one of various theoretically possible races caused
by the wrong ordering inside arizona_extcon_remove(), this fixes the
ordering fixing all possible races, including the reported oops.
