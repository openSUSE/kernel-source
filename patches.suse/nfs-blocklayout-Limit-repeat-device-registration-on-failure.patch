Subject: [PATCH] nfs/blocklayout: Limit repeat device registration on failure
Git-commit: 614733f9441ed53bb442d4734112ec1e24bd6da7
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
References: git-fixes

Every pNFS SCSI IO wants to do LAYOUTGET, then within the layout find the
device which can drive GETDEVINFO, then finally may need to prep the device
with a reservation.  This slow work makes a mess of IO latencies if one of
the later steps is going to fail for awhile.

If we're unable to register a SCSI device, ensure we mark the device as
unavailable so that it will timeout and be re-added via GETDEVINFO.  This
avoids repeated doomed attempts to register a device in the IO path.

Add some clarifying comments as well.
