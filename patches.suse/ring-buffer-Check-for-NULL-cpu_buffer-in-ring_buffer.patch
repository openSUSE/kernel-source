Subject: [PATCH] ring-buffer: Check for NULL cpu_buffer in ring_buffer_wake_waiters()
Message-ID: <20221101191009.1e7378c8@rorschach.local.home>
Patch-mainline: Submitted, trace ML
References: bsc#1204705

On some machines the number of listed CPUs may be bigger than the actual
CPUs that exist. The tracing subsystem allocates a per_cpu directory with
access to the per CPU ring buffer via a cpuX file. But to save space, the
ring buffer will only allocate buffers for online CPUs, even though the
CPU array will be as big as the nr_cpu_ids.

With the addition of waking waiters on the ring buffer when closing the
file, the ring_buffer_wake_waiters() now needs to make sure that the
buffer is allocated (with the irq_work allocated with it) before trying to
wake waiters, as it will cause a NULL pointer dereference.

While debugging this, I added a NULL check for the buffer itself (which is
OK to do), and also NULL pointer checks against buffer->buffers (which is
not fine, and will WARN) as well as making sure the CPU number passed in
is within the nr_cpu_ids (which is also not fine if it isn't).
