Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: intel: refine runtime pm for SDW_INTEL_CLK_STOP_BUS_RESET
References: jsc#SLE-16518
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/vkoul/soundwire.git
Git-commit: 08abad9f45f105e947d91822bdbc47650fbd7773

When all the links are suspended, the HDaudio controller may suspend
and the power rails to the SoundWire IP may be disabled, requiring a
complete re-initialization/enumeration on resume. However, if one or
more Masters remained active, the HDaudio controller will remain active
and the power rails will remain enabled. As a result, during the link
resume step we can check if the context was preserved by verifying if
the clock was stopped, and avoid doing a complete bus reset and
re-enumeration.
