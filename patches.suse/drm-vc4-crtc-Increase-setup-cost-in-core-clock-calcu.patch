Subject: [PATCH] drm/vc4: crtc: Increase setup cost in core clock calculation to handle extreme reduced blanking
Git-commit: 247a631f9c0ffb37ed0786a94cb4c5f2b6fc7ab1
Patch-mainline: v6.2
References: git-fixes

The formula that determines the core clock requirement based on pixel
clock and blanking has been determined experimentally to minimise the
clock while supporting all modes we've seen.

A new reduced blanking mode (4kp60 at 533MHz rather than the standard
594MHz) has been seen that doesn't produce a high enough clock and
results in "flip_done timed out" error.

Increase the setup cost in the formula to make this work. The result is
a reduced blanking mode increases by up to 7MHz while leaving the
standard timing
mode untouched
