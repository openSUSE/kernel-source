Subject: perf ui browser hists: Set actions->thread before calling
 do_zoom_thread()
Git-commit: 1741189d843a1d5ef38538bc52a3760e2e46cb2e
Patch-mainline: v6.16-rc1
References: git-fixes

In 7cecb7fe8388d5c3 ("perf hists: Move sort__has_comm into struct
perf_hpp_list") it assumes that act->thread is set prior to calling
do_zoom_thread().

This doesn't happen when we use ESC or the Left arrow key to Zoom out of
a specific thread, making this operation not to work and we get stuck
into the thread zoom.

In 6422184b087ff435 ("perf hists browser: Simplify zooming code using
pstack_peek()") it says no need to set actions->thread, and at that
point that was true, but in 7cecb7fe8388d5c3 a actions->thread == NULL
check was added before the zoom out of thread could kick in.

We can zoom out using the alternative 't' thread zoom toggle hotkey to
finally set actions->thread before calling do_zoom_thread() and zoom
out, but lets also fix the ESC/Zoom out of thread case.
