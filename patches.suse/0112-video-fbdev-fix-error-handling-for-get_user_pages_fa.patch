Subject: video: fbdev: fix error handling for get_user_pages_fast()
Git-commit: e2e1c7bda4445363027a4ceed1cc3a8ccc2472a9
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-12680, jsc#SLE-12880, jsc#SLE-12882, jsc#SLE-12883, jsc#SLE-13496, jsc#SLE-15322

Dealing with the return value of get_user_pages*() variants has a few
classic pitfalls, and this driver found one of them: the return value
might be zero, positive, or -errno. And if positive, it might be fewer
pages than were requested. And if fewer pages than requested, then
the caller should return (via put_page()) the pages that *were*
pinned.

This driver was doing that *except* that it had a problem with the
-errno case, which was being stored in an unsigned int, and which
would case an interesting mess if it ever happened: nr_pages would be
interpreted as a spectacularly huge unsigned value, rather than a
small negative value. Also, it was unnecessarily overriding a
potentially informative -errno, with -EINVAL, in some cases.

Instead: clamp the nr_pages to zero or positive, so that the error
handling works. And return the -errno value from get_user_pages*(),
unchanged, if we get one. And explain this with comments, seeing as
how it is error-prone.
