Subject: [PATCH] hfs: make splice write available again
Git-commit: 4c831f30475a222046ded25560c3810117a6cff6
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc1
References: git-fixes

Since 5.10, splice() or sendfile() return EINVAL. This was
caused by commit 36e2c7421f02 ("fs: don't allow splice read/write
without explicit ops").

This patch initializes the splice_write field in file_operations, like
most file systems do, to restore the functionality.

Fixes: 36e2c7421f02 ("fs: don't allow splice read/write without explicit ops")
