Subject: [PATCH] Reinstate some of "swiotlb: rework "fix info leak with DMA_FROM_DEVICE""

Git-commit: 901c7280ca0d5e2b4a8929fbe0bfb007ac2a6544
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: CVE-2022-0854 bsc#1196823 CVE-2022-48853 bsc#1228015

Halil Pasic points out [1] that the full revert of that commit (revert
in bddac7c1e02b), and that a partial revert that only reverts the
problematic case, but still keeps some of the cleanups is probably
better.  ￼

And that partial revert [2] had already been verified by Oleksandr
Natalenko to also fix the issue, I had just missed that in the long
discussion.

So let's reinstate the cleanups from commit aa6f8dcbab47 ("swiotlb:
rework "fix info leak with DMA_FROM_DEVICE""), and effectively only
revert the part that caused problems.
