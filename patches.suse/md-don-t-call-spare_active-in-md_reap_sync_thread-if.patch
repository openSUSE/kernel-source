Subject: md: don't call spare_active in md_reap_sync_thread if all member
 devices can't work
Git-commit: 0d8ed0e9bf9643f27f4816dca61081784dedb38d
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.4

When add one disk to array, the md_reap_sync_thread is responsible
to activate the spare and set In_sync flag for the new member in
spare_active().

But if raid1 has one member disk A, and disk B is added to the array.
Then we offline A before all the datas are synchronized from A to B,
obviously B doesn't have the latest data as A, but B is still marked
with In_sync flag.

So let's not call spare_active under the condition, otherwise B is
still showed with 'U' state which is not correct.
