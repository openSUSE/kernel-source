Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: send, orphanize first all conflicting inodes when
 processing references
References: bsc#1178579

When doing an incremental send it is possible that when processing the new
references for an inode we end up issuing rename or link operations that
have an invalid path, which contains the orphanized name of a directory
before we actually orphanized it, causing the receiver to fail.

The following reproducer triggers such scenario:

  $ cat reproducer.sh
  #!/bin/bash

  mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdi >/dev/null
  mount /dev/sdi /mnt/sdi

  touch /mnt/sdi/a
  touch /mnt/sdi/b
  mkdir /mnt/sdi/testdir
  # We want "a" to have a lower inode number then "testdir" (257 vs 259).
  mv /mnt/sdi/a /mnt/sdi/testdir/a

  # Filesystem looks like:
  #
  # .                           (ino 256)
  # |----- testdir/             (ino 259)
  # |          |----- a         (ino 257)
  # |
  # |----- b                    (ino 258)

  btrfs subvolume snapshot -r /mnt/sdi /mnt/sdi/snap1
  btrfs send -f /tmp/snap1.send /mnt/sdi/snap1

  # Now rename 259 to "testdir_2", then change the name of 257 to
  # "testdir" and make it a direct descendant of the root inode (256).
  # Also create a new link for inode 257 with the old name of inode 258.
  # By swapping the names and location of several inodes and create a
  # nasty dependency chain of rename and link operations.
  mv /mnt/sdi/testdir/a /mnt/sdi/a2
  touch /mnt/sdi/testdir/a
  mv /mnt/sdi/b /mnt/sdi/b2
  ln /mnt/sdi/a2 /mnt/sdi/b
  mv /mnt/sdi/testdir /mnt/sdi/testdir_2
  mv /mnt/sdi/a2 /mnt/sdi/testdir

  # Filesystem now looks like:
  #
  # .                            (ino 256)
  # |----- testdir_2/            (ino 259)
  # |          |----- a          (ino 260)
  # |
  # |----- testdir               (ino 257)
  # |----- b                     (ino 257)
  # |----- b2                    (ino 258)

  btrfs subvolume snapshot -r /mnt/sdi /mnt/sdi/snap2
  btrfs send -f /tmp/snap2.send -p /mnt/sdi/snap1 /mnt/sdi/snap2

  mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdj >/dev/null
  mount /dev/sdj /mnt/sdj

  btrfs receive -f /tmp/snap1.send /mnt/sdj
  btrfs receive -f /tmp/snap2.send /mnt/sdj

  umount /mnt/sdi
  umount /mnt/sdj

When running the reproducer, the receive of the incremental send stream
fails:

  $ ./reproducer.sh
  Create a readonly snapshot of '/mnt/sdi' in '/mnt/sdi/snap1'
  At subvol /mnt/sdi/snap1
  Create a readonly snapshot of '/mnt/sdi' in '/mnt/sdi/snap2'
  At subvol /mnt/sdi/snap2
  At subvol snap1
  At snapshot snap2
  ERROR: link b -> o259-6-0/a failed: No such file or directory

The problem happens because of the following:

1) Before we start iterating the list of new references for inode 257,
   we generate its current path and store it at @valid_path, done at
   the very beginning of process_recorded_refs(). The generated path
   is "o259-6-0/a", containing the orphanized name for inode 259;

2) Then we iterate over the list of new references, which has the
   references "b" and "testdir" in that specific order;

3) We process reference "b" first, because it is in the list before
   reference "testdir". We then issue a link operation to create
   the new reference "b" using a target path corresponding to the
   content at @valid_path, which corresponds to "o259-6-0/a".
   However we haven't yet orphanized inode 259, its name is still
   "testdir", and not "o259-6-0". The orphanization of 259 did not
   happen yet because we will process the reference named "testdir"
   for inode 257 only in the next iteration of the loop that goes
   over the list of new references.

Fix the issue by having a preliminar iteration over all the new references
at process_recorded_refs(). This iteration is responsible only for doing
the orphanization of other inodes that have and old reference that
conflicts with one of the new references of the inode we are currently
processing. The emission of rename and link operations happen now in the
next iteration of the new references.

A test case for fstests will follow soon.
