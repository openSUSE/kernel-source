Subject: drm/scheduler: make unexported items static
Git-commit: 2636a5172da2eadee8190fad8d82d25d9a276525
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: bsc#1152489

The drm_sched_fence_ops_{scheduled,finished} are not exported
from the file so make them static to avoid the following
warnings from sparse:

drivers/gpu/drm/scheduler/sched_fence.c:131:28: warning: symbol 'drm_sched_fence_ops_scheduled' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/gpu/drm/scheduler/sched_fence.c:137:28: warning: symbol 'drm_sched_fence_ops_finished' was not declared. Should it be static?
