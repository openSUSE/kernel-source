Subject: [PATCH] media: imon: make send_packet() more robust
Git-commit: eecd203ada43a4693ce6fdd3a58ae10c7819252c
Patch-mainline: v6.18-rc1
References: stable-fixes CVE-2025-68194 bsc#1255325

syzbot is reporting that imon has three problems which result in
hung tasks due to forever holding device lock [1].

First problem is that when usb_rx_callback_intf0() once got -EPROTO error
after ictx->dev_present_intf0 became true, usb_rx_callback_intf0()
resubmits urb after printk(), and resubmitted urb causes
usb_rx_callback_intf0() to again get -EPROTO error. This results in
printk() flooding (RCU stalls).

Alan Stern commented [2] that

  In theory it's okay to resubmit _if_ the driver has a robust
  error-recovery scheme (such as giving up after some fixed limit on the
  number of errors or after some fixed time has elapsed, perhaps with a
  time delay to prevent a flood of errors).  Most drivers don't bother to
  do this; they simply give up right away.  This makes them more
  vulnerable to short-term noise interference during USB transfers, but in
  reality such interference is quite rare.  There's nothing really wrong
  with giving up right away.

but imon has a poor error-recovery scheme which just retries forever;
this behavior should be fixed.

Since I'm not sure whether it is safe for imon users to give up upon any
error code, this patch takes care of only union of error codes chosen from
modules in drivers/media/rc/ directory which handle -EPROTO error (i.e.
ir_toy, mceusb and igorplugusb).

Second problem is that when usb_rx_callback_intf0() once got -EPROTO error
before ictx->dev_present_intf0 becomes true, usb_rx_callback_intf0() always
resubmits urb due to commit 8791d63af0cf ("[media] imon: don't wedge
hardware after early callbacks"). Move the ictx->dev_present_intf0 test
introduced by commit 6f6b90c9231a ("[media] imon: don't parse scancodes
until intf configured") to immediately before imon_incoming_packet(), or
the first problem explained above happens without printk() flooding (i.e.
hung task).

Third problem is that when usb_rx_callback_intf0() is not called for some
reason (e.g. flaky hardware; the reproducer for this problem sometimes
prevents usb_rx_callback_intf0() from being called),
wait_for_completion_interruptible() in send_packet() never returns (i.e.
hung task). As a workaround for such situation, change send_packet() to
wait for completion with timeout of 10 seconds.
