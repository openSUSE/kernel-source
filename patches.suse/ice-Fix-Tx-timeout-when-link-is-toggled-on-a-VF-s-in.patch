Subject: ice: Fix Tx timeout when link is toggled on a VF's interface
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
Git-commit: 4dc926d3a59e73b8c4adf51b261f1a1bbd48a989
References: jsc#SLE-12878

Currently if the iavf is loaded and a VF link transitions from up to
down to up again a Tx timeout will be triggered. This happens because
Tx/Rx queue interrupts are only enabled when receiving the
VIRTCHNL_OP_CONFIG_MAP_IRQ message, which happens on reset or initial
iavf driver load, but not when bringing link up. This is problematic
because they are disabled on the VIRTCHNL_OP_DISABLE_QUEUES message,
which is part of bringing a VF's link down. However, they are not
enabled on the VIRTCHNL_OP_ENABLE_QUEUES message, which is part of
bringing a VF's link up.

Fix this by re-enabling the VF's Rx and Tx queue interrupts when they
were previously configured. This is done by first checking to make
sure the previous value in QINT_[R|T]QCTL.MSIX_INDX is not 0, which
is used to represent the OICR in the VF's interrupt space. If the
MSIX_INDX is non-zero then enable the interrupt by setting the
QINT_[R|T]CTL.CAUSE_ENA bit to 1.
