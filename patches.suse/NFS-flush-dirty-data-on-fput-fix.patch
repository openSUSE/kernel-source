Subject: don't call utsname() after ->nsproxy is NULL.
References: bsc#1201196
Patch-mainline: Never, not needed

Our patch 0001-NFS-flush-out-dirty-data-on-file-fput.patch calls fsync()
from nfs_file_release().  This can be called late in do_exit()
when the final delayed fput() is called.
At this point ->nsproxy is already NULL, so utsname() cannot safely
be used.

The string constucted with utsname() calls is optional - it is present
in the protocol for debugging only.  It is perfectly safe not to include
it.

So if current->nsproxy is NULL, skip generation of this string.
