Subject: ecryptfs_lookup_interpose(): lower_dentry->d_parent is not stable
 either
Git-commit: 762c69685ff7ad5ad7fee0656671e20a0c9c864d
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc8
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.12

We need to get the underlying dentry of parent; sure, absent the races
it is the parent of underlying dentry, but there's nothing to prevent
losing a timeslice to preemtion in the middle of evaluation of
lower_dentry->d_parent->d_inode, having another process move lower_dentry
around and have its (ex)parent not pinned anymore and freed on memory
pressure.  Then we regain CPU and try to fetch ->d_inode from memory
that is freed by that point.

dentry->d_parent *is* stable here - it's an argument of ->lookup() and
we are guaranteed that it won't be moved anywhere until we feed it
to d_add/d_splice_alias.  So we safely go that way to get to its
underlying dentry.
