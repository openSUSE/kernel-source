Subject: [PATCH] video: hgafb: correctly handle card detect failure during probe
Git-commit: 02625c965239b71869326dd0461615f27307ecb3
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc4
References: git-fixes

The return value of hga_card_detect() is not properly handled causing
the probe to succeed even though hga_card_detect() failed. Since probe
succeeds, hgafb_open() can be called which will end up operating on an
unmapped hga_vram. This results in an out-of-bounds access as reported
by kernel test robot [1].

To fix this, correctly detect failure of hga_card_detect() by checking
for a non-zero error code.
