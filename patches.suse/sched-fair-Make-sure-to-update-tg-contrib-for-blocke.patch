Subject: [PATCH] sched/fair: Make sure to update tg contrib for blocked load
Git-commit: 02da26ad5ed6ea8680e5d01f20661439611ed776
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc6
References: git-fixes

During the update of fair blocked load (__update_blocked_fair()), we
update the contribution of the cfs in tg->load_avg if cfs_rq's pelt
has decayed.  Nevertheless, the pelt values of a cfs_rq could have
been recently updated while propagating the change of a child. In this
case, cfs_rq's pelt will not decayed because it has already been
updated and we don't update tg->load_avg.

__update_blocked_fair
  ...
  for_each_leaf_cfs_rq_safe: child cfs_rq
    update cfs_rq_load_avg() for child cfs_rq
    ...
    update_load_avg(cfs_rq_of(se), se, 0)
      ...
      update cfs_rq_load_avg() for parent cfs_rq
		-propagation of child's load makes parent cfs_rq->load_sum
		 becoming null
        -UPDATE_TG is not set so it doesn't update parent
		 cfs_rq->tg_load_avg_contrib
  ..
  for_each_leaf_cfs_rq_safe: parent cfs_rq
    update cfs_rq_load_avg() for parent cfs_rq
      - nothing to do because parent cfs_rq has already been updated
		recently so cfs_rq->tg_load_avg_contrib is not updated
    ...
    parent cfs_rq is decayed
      list_del_leaf_cfs_rq parent cfs_rq
	  - but it still contibutes to tg->load_avg

we must set UPDATE_TG flags when propagting pending load to the parent
