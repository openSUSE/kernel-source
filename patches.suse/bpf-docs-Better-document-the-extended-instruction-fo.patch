Subject: bpf, docs: Better document the extended instruction format
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
Git-commit: 5ca15b8a939ff59f3e9f957ad4af5658c016cf7e
References: jsc#PED-1368

In addition to the normal 64-bit instruction encoding, eBPF also has
a single instruction that uses a second 64-bit bits for a second
immediate value.  Instead of only documenting this format deep down
in the document mention it in the instruction encoding section.

 Instruction encoding
 ====================
 
-eBPF uses 64-bit instructions with the following encoding:
+eBPF has two instruction encodings:
+
+ * the basic instruction encoding, which uses 64 bits to encode an instruction
+ * the wide instruction encoding, which appends a second 64-bit immediate value
+   (imm64) after the basic instruction for a total of 128 bits.
+
+The basic instruction encoding looks as follows:
 
  =============  =======  ===============  ====================  ============

+Instructions with the ``BPF_IMM`` mode modifier use the wide instruction

+There is currently only one such instruction.

-eBPF has one 16-byte instruction: ``BPF_LD | BPF_DW | BPF_IMM`` which consists
-of two consecutive ``struct bpf_insn`` 8-byte blocks and interpreted as single
-instruction that loads 64-bit immediate value into a dst_reg.
