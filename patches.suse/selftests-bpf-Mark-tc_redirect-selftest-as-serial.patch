Subject: selftests/bpf: Mark tc_redirect selftest as serial
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
Git-commit: 2c0f51ac320649402a80a6228744eb54f42a5c21
References: jsc#PED-1368

It seems to cause a lot of harm to kprobe/tracepoint selftests. Yucong
mentioned before that it does manipulate sysfs, which might be the
reason. So let's mark it as serial, though ideally it would be less
intrusive on the system at test.
