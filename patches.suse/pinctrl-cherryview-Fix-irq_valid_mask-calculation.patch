Subject: [PATCH] pinctrl: cherryview: Fix irq_valid_mask calculation
Git-commit: 63bdef6cd6941917c823b9cc9aa0219d19fcb716
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc7
References: git-fixes bnc#1151927 5.3.11

Commit 03c4749dd6c7 ("gpio / ACPI: Drop unnecessary ACPI GPIO to Linux
GPIO translation") has made the cherryview gpio numbers sparse, to get
a 1:1 mapping between ACPI pin numbers and gpio numbers in Linux.

This has greatly simplified things, but the code setting the
irq_valid_mask was not updated for this, so the valid mask is still in
the old "compressed" numbering with the gaps in the pin numbers skipped,
which is wrong as irq_valid_mask needs to be expressed in gpio numbers.

This results in the following error on devices using pin 24 (0x0018) on
the north GPIO controller as an ACPI event source:

[    0.422452] cherryview-pinctrl INT33FF:01: Failed to translate GPIO to IRQ

This has been reported (by email) to be happening on a Caterpillar CAT T20
tablet and I've reproduced this myself on a Medion Akoya e2215t 2-in-1.

This commit uses the pin number instead of the compressed index into
community->pins to clear the correct bits in irq_valid_mask for GPIOs
using GPEs for interrupts, fixing these errors and in case of the
Medion Akoya e2215t also fixing the LID switch not working.
