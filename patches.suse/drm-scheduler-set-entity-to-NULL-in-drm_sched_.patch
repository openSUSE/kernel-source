Subject: [PATCH] drm/scheduler: set entity to NULL in
 drm_sched_entity_pop_job()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.4.12
Git-commit: 96c7c2f4d5bd94b15fe63448c087f01607b56f4a

[ Upstream commit 96c7c2f4d5bd94b15fe63448c087f01607b56f4a ]

It already happend a few times that patches slipped through which
implemented access to an entity through a job that was already removed
from the entities queue. Since jobs and entities might have different
lifecycles, this can potentially cause UAF bugs.

In order to make it obvious that a jobs entity pointer shouldn't be
accessed after drm_sched_entity_pop_job() was called successfully, set
the jobs entity pointer to NULL once the job is removed from the entity
queue.

Moreover, debugging a potential NULL pointer dereference is way easier
than potentially corrupted memory through a UAF.
