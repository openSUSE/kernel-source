Subject: drm/scheduler: set entity to NULL in drm_sched_entity_pop_job()
Git-commit: 96c7c2f4d5bd94b15fe63448c087f01607b56f4a
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc1
References: jsc#PED-3527 jsc#PED-5475 jsc#PED-6068 jsc#PED-6070 jsc#PED-6116 jsc#PED-6120 jsc#PED-5065 jsc#PED-5477 jsc#PED-5511 jsc#PED-6041 jsc#PED-6069 jsc#PED-6071

It already happend a few times that patches slipped through which
implemented access to an entity through a job that was already removed
from the entities queue. Since jobs and entities might have different
lifecycles, this can potentially cause UAF bugs.

In order to make it obvious that a jobs entity pointer shouldn't be
accessed after drm_sched_entity_pop_job() was called successfully, set
the jobs entity pointer to NULL once the job is removed from the entity
queue.

Moreover, debugging a potential NULL pointer dereference is way easier
than potentially corrupted memory through a UAF.
