Subject: [PATCH] selftests/futex: pass _GNU_SOURCE without a value to the
 compiler
Git-commit: cb708ab9f584f159798b60853edcf0c8b67ce295
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc3
References: git-fixes

It's slightly better to set _GNU_SOURCE in the source code, but if one
must do it via the compiler invocation, then the best way to do so is
this:

    $(CC) -D_GNU_SOURCE=

...because otherwise, if this form is used:

    $(CC) -D_GNU_SOURCE

...then that leads the compiler to set a value, as if you had passed in:

    $(CC) -D_GNU_SOURCE=1

That, in turn, leads to warnings under both gcc and clang, like this:

    futex_requeue_pi.c:20: warning: "_GNU_SOURCE" redefined

Fix this by using the "-D_GNU_SOURCE=" form.
