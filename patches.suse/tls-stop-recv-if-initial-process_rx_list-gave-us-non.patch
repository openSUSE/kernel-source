Subject: [PATCH] tls: stop recv() if initial process_rx_list gave us non-DATA
Git-commit: fdfbaec5923d9359698cbb286bc0deadbb717504
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc6
References: bsc#1221858

If we have a non-DATA record on the rx_list and another record of the
same type still on the queue, we will end up merging them:
 - process_rx_list copies the non-DATA record
 - we start the loop and process the first available record since it's
   of the same type
 - we break out of the loop since the record was not DATA

Just check the record type and jump to the end in case process_rx_list
did some work.
