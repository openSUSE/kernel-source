Subject: devlink: expand the devlink-info documentation
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
Git-commit: cd556e40fdf3b09e229097021a9148ecb6e7725e
References: bsc#1176447

We are having multiple review cycles with all vendors trying
to implement devlink-info. Let's expand the documentation with
more information about what's implemented and motivation behind
this interface in an attempt to make the implementations easier.

Describe what each info section is supposed to contain, and make
some references to other HW interfaces (PCI caps).

Document how firmware management is expected to look, to make
it clear how devlink-info and devlink-flash work in concert.

Name some future work.

v2: - improve wording
v3: - improve wording

+Devlink Flash
+=============
+
+The ``devlink-flash`` API allows updating device firmware. It replaces the
+older ``ethtool-flash`` mechanism, and doesn't require taking any
+networking locks in the kernel to perform the flash update. Example use::
+
+  $ devlink dev flash pci/0000:05:00.0 file flash-boot.bin
+
+Note that the file name is a path relative to the firmware loading path
+(usually ``/lib/firmware/``). Drivers may send status updates to inform
+user space about the progress of the update operation.
+
+Firmware Loading
+================
+
+Devices which require firmware to operate usually store it in non-volatile
+memory on the board, e.g. flash. Some devices store only basic firmware on
+the board, and the driver loads the rest from disk during probing.
+``devlink-info`` allows users to query firmware information (loaded
+components and versions).
+
+In other cases the device can both store the image on the board, load from
+disk, or automatically flash a new image from disk. The ``fw_load_policy``
+devlink parameter can be used to control this behavior
+(:ref:`Documentation/networking/devlink/devlink-params.rst <devlink_params_generic>`).
+
+On-disk firmware files are usually stored in ``/lib/firmware/``.
+
+Firmware Version Management
+===========================
+
+Drivers are expected to implement ``devlink-flash`` and ``devlink-info``
+functionality, which together allow for implementing vendor-independent
+automated firmware update facilities.
+
+``devlink-info`` exposes the ``driver`` name and three version groups
+(``fixed``, ``running``, ``stored``).
+
+The ``driver`` attribute and ``fixed`` group identify the specific device
+design, e.g. for looking up applicable firmware updates. This is why
+``serial_number`` is not part of the ``fixed`` versions (even though it
+is fixed) - ``fixed`` versions should identify the design, not a single
+device.
+
+``running`` and ``stored`` firmware versions identify the firmware running
+on the device, and firmware which will be activated after reboot or device
+reset.
+
+The firmware update agent is supposed to be able to follow this simple
+algorithm to update firmware contents, regardless of the device vendor:
+
+.. code-block:: sh
+
+  # Get unique HW design identifier
+  $hw_id = devlink-dev-info['fixed']
+
+  # Find out which FW flash we want to use for this NIC
+  $want_flash_vers = some-db-backed.lookup($hw_id, 'flash')
+
+  # Update flash if necessary
+  if $want_flash_vers != devlink-dev-info['stored']:
+      $file = some-db-backed.download($hw_id, 'flash')
+      devlink-dev-flash($file)
+
+  # Find out the expected overall firmware versions
+  $want_fw_vers = some-db-backed.lookup($hw_id, 'all')
+
+  # Update on-disk file if necessary
+  if $want_fw_vers != devlink-dev-info['running']:
+      $file = some-db-backed.download($hw_id, 'disk')
+      write($file, '/lib/firmware/')
+
+  # Try device reset, if available
+  if $want_fw_vers != devlink-dev-info['running']:
+     devlink-reset()
+
+  # Reboot, if reset wasn't enough
+  if $want_fw_vers != devlink-dev-info['running']:
+     reboot()
+
+Note that each reference to ``devlink-dev-info`` in this pseudo-code
+is expected to fetch up-to-date information from the kernel.
+
+For the convenience of identifying firmware files some vendors add
+``bundle_id`` information to the firmware versions. This meta-version covers
+multiple per-component versions and can be used e.g. in firmware file names
+(all component versions could get rather long.)

-   * - Type
+   * - Name
      - Description
+   * - ``driver``
+     - Name of the currently used device driver, also available through sysfs.
+
+   * - ``serial_number``
+     - Serial number of the device.
+
+       This is usually the serial number of the ASIC, also often available
+       in PCI config space of the device in the *Device Serial Number*
+       capability.
+
+       The serial number should be unique per physical device.
+       Sometimes the serial number of the device is only 48 bits long (the
+       length of the Ethernet MAC address), and since PCI DSN is 64 bits long
+       devices pad or encode additional information into the serial number.
+       One example is adding port ID or PCI interface ID in the extra two bytes.
+       Drivers should make sure to strip or normalize any such padding
+       or interface ID, and report only the part of the serial number
+       which uniquely identifies the hardware. In other words serial number
+       reported for two ports of the same device or on two hosts of
+       a multi-host device should be identical.
+
+       .. note:: ``devlink-info`` API should be extended with a new field
+	  if devices want to report board/product serial number (often
+	  reported in PCI *Vital Product Data* capability).
+
    * - ``fixed``
-     - Represents fixed versions, which cannot change. For example,
+     - Group for hardware identifiers, and versions of components
+       which are not field-updatable.
+
+       Versions in this section identify the device design. For example,
        component identifiers or the board version reported in the PCI VPD.
+       Data in ``devlink-info`` should be broken into the smallest logical
+       components, e.g. PCI VPD may concatenate various information
+       to form the Part Number string, while in ``devlink-info`` all parts
+       should be reported as separate items.
+
+       This group must not contain any frequently changing identifiers,
+       such as serial numbers. See
+       :ref:`Documentation/networking/devlink/devlink-flash.rst <devlink_flash>`
+       to understand why.
+
    * - ``running``
-     - Represents the version of the currently running component. For
-       example the running version of firmware. These versions generally
-       only update after a reboot.
+     - Group for information about currently running software/firmware.
+       These versions often only update after a reboot, sometimes device reset.
+
    * - ``stored``
-     - Represents the version of a component as stored, such as after a
-       flash update. Stored values should update to reflect changes in the
-       flash even if a reboot has not yet occurred.
+     - Group for software/firmware versions in device flash.
+
+       Stored values must update to reflect changes in the flash even
+       if reboot has not yet occurred. If device is not capable of updating
+       ``stored`` versions when new software is flashed, it must not report
+       them.
+
+Each version can be reported at most once in each version group. Firmware
+components stored on the flash should feature in both the ``running`` and
+``stored`` sections, if device is capable of reporting ``stored`` versions
+(see :ref:`Documentation/networking/devlink/devlink-flash.rst <devlink_flash>`).
+In case software/firmware components are loaded from the disk (e.g.
+``/lib/firmware``) only the running version should be reported via
+the kernel API.

+
+   * - Name
+     - Description
+   * - ``id``, ``revision``
+     - Identifiers of designs and revision, mostly used for hardware versions.
+
+   * - ``api``
+     - Version of API between components. API items are usually of limited
+       value to the user, and can be inferred from other versions by the vendor,
+       so adding API versions is generally discouraged as noise.
+
+   * - ``bundle_id``

+       This is an attribute of a firmware package which covers multiple versions
+       for ease of managing firmware images (see

+
+       ``bundle_id`` can appear in both ``running`` and ``stored`` versions,
