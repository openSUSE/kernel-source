Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: git-fixes stable-5.14.19

Since commit edc6afc54968 ("tty: switch to ktermios and new framework")
termios speed is no longer stored only in c_cflag member but also in new
additional c_ispeed and c_ospeed members. If BOTHER flag is set in c_cflag
then termios speed is stored only in these new members.

Therefore to correctly restore termios speed it is required to store also
ispeed and ospeed members, not only cflag member.

In case only cflag member with BOTHER flag is restored then functions
tty_termios_baud_rate() and tty_termios_input_baud_rate() returns baudrate
stored in c_ospeed / c_ispeed member, which is zero as it was not restored
too. If reported baudrate is invalid (e.g. zero) then serial core functions
report fallback baudrate value 9600. So it means that in this case original
baudrate is lost and kernel changes it to value 9600.

Simple reproducer of this issue is to boot kernel with following command
line argument: "console=ttyXXX,86400" (where ttyXXX is the device name).
For speed 86400 there is no Bnnn constant and therefore kernel has to
represent this speed via BOTHER c_cflag. Which means that speed is stored
only in c_ospeed and c_ispeed members, not in c_cflag anymore.

If bootloader correctly configures serial device to speed 86400 then kernel
prints boot log to early console at speed speed 86400 without any issue.
But after kernel starts initializing real console device ttyXXX then speed
is changed to fallback value 9600 because information about speed was lost.

This patch fixes above issue by storing and restoring also ispeed and
ospeed members, which are required for BOTHER flag.
