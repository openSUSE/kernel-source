Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: fix a race between scrub and block group
 removal/allocation

When scrub is verifying the extents of a block group for a device, it is
possible that the corresponding block group gets removed and its logical
address and device extents get used for a new block group allocation.
When this happens scrub incorrectly reports that errors were detected
and, if the the new block group has a different profile then the old one,
deleted block group, we can crash due to a null pointer dereference.
Possibly other unexpected and weird consequences can happen as well.

Consider the following sequence of actions that leads to the null pointer
dereference crash when scrub is running in parallel with balance:

1) Balance sets block group X to read-only mode and starts relocating it.
   Block group X is a metadata block group, has a raid1 profile (two
   device extents, each one in a different device) and a logical address
   of 19424870400;

2) Scrub is running and finds device extent E, which belongs to block
   group X. It enters scrub_stripe() to find all extents allocated to
   block group X, the search is done using the extent tree;

3) Balance finishes relocating block group X and removes block group X;

4) Balance starts relocating another block group and when trying to
   commit the current transaction as part of the preparation step
   (prepare_to_relocate()), it blocks because scrub is running;

5) The scrub task finds the metadata extent at the logical address
   19425001472 and marks the pages of the extent to be read by a bio
   (struct scrub_bio). The extent item's flags, which have the bit
   BTRFS_EXTENT_FLAG_TREE_BLOCK set, are added to each page (struct
   scrub_page). It is these flags in the scrub pages that tells the
   bio's end io function (scrub_bio_end_io_worker) which type of extent
   it is dealing with. At this point we end up with 4 pages in a bio
   which is ready for submission (the metadata extent has a size of
   16Kb, so that gives 4 pages on x86);

6) At the next iteration of scrub_stripe(), scrub checks that there is a
   pause request from the relocation task trying to commit a transaction,
   therefore it submits the pending bio and pauses, waiting for the
   transaction commit to complete before resuming;

7) The relocation task commits the transaction. The device extent E, that
   was used by our block group X, is now available for allocation, since
   the commit root for the device tree was swapped by the transaction
   commit;

8) Another task doing a direct IO write allocates a new data block group Y
   which ends using device extent E. This new block group Y also ends up
   getting the same logical address that block group X had: 19424870400.
   This happens because block group X was the block group with the highest
   logical address and, when allocating Y, find_next_chunk() returns the
   end offset of the current last block group to be used as the logical
   address for the new block group, which is

        18351128576 + 1073741824 = 19424870400

   So our new block group Y has the same logical address and device extent
   that block group X had. However Y is a data block group, while X was
   a metadata one, and Y has a raid0 profile, while X had a raid1 profile;

9) After allocating block group Y, the direct IO submits a bio to write
   to device extent E;

10) The read bio submitted by scrub reads the 4 pages (16Kb) from device
    extent E, which now correspond to the data written by the task that
    did a direct IO write. Then at the end io function associated with
    the bio, scrub_bio_end_io_worker(), we call scrub_block_complete()
    which calls scrub_checksum(). This later function checks the flags
    of the first page, and sees that the bit BTRFS_EXTENT_FLAG_TREE_BLOCK
    is set in the flags, so it assumes it has a metadata extent and
    then calls scrub_checksum_tree_block(). That functions returns an
    error, since interpreting data as a metadata extent causes the
    checksum verification to fail.

    So this makes scrub_checksum() call scrub_handle_errored_block(),
    which determines 'failed_mirror_index' to be 1, since the device
    extent E was allocated as the second mirror of block group X.

    It allocates BTRFS_MAX_MIRRORS scrub_block structures as an array at
    'sblocks_for_recheck', and all the memory is initialized to zeroes by
    kcalloc().

    After that it calls scrub_setup_recheck_block(), which is responsible
    for filling each of those structures. However, when that function
    calls btrfs_map_sblock() against the logical address of the metadata
    extent, 19425001472, it gets a struct btrfs_bio ('bbio') that matches
    the current block group Y. However block group Y has a raid0 profile
    and not a raid1 profile like X had, so the following call returns 1:

       scrub_nr_raid_mirrors(bbio)

    And as a result scrub_setup_recheck_block() only initializes the
    first (index 0) scrub_block structure in 'sblocks_for_recheck'.

    Then scrub_recheck_block() is called by scrub_handle_errored_block()
    with the second (index 1) scrub_block structure as the argument,
    because 'failed_mirror_index' was previously set to 1.
    This scrub_block was not initialized by scrub_setup_recheck_block(),
    so it has zero pages, its 'page_count' member is 0 and its 'pagev'
    page array has all members pointing to NULL.

    Finally when scrub_recheck_block() calls scrub_recheck_block_checksum()
    we have a NULL pointer dereference when accessing the flags of the first
    page, as pavev[0] is NULL:

    static void scrub_recheck_block_checksum(struct scrub_block *sblock)
    {
        (...)
        if (sblock->pagev[0]->flags & BTRFS_EXTENT_FLAG_DATA)
            scrub_checksum_data(sblock);
        (...)
    }

    Producing a stack trace like the following:

This issue has been around for a long time, possibly since scrub exists.
The last time I ran into it was over 2 years ago. After recently fixing
fstests to pass the "--full-balance" command line option to btrfs-progs
when doing balance, several tests started to more heavily exercise balance
with fsstress, scrub and other operations in parallel, and therefore
started to hit this issue again (with btrfs/061 for example).

Fix this by having scrub increment the 'trimming' counter of the block
group, which pins the block group in such a way that it guarantees neither
its logical address nor device extents can be reused by future block group
allocations until we decrement the 'trimming' counter. Also make sure that
on each iteration of scrub_stripe() we stop scrubbing the block group if
it was removed already.

A later patch in the series will rename the block group's 'trimming'
counter and its helpers to a more generic name, since now it is not used
exclusively for pinning while trimming anymore.
