Subject: PCI/pwrctrl: Cancel outstanding rescan work when unregistering

Git-commit: 8b926f237743f020518162c62b93cb7107a2b5eb
Patch-mainline: 6.16-rc1

It's possible to trigger use-after-free here by:

  (a) forcing rescan_work_func() to take a long time and
  (b) utilizing a pwrctrl driver that may be unloaded for some reason

Cancel outstanding work to ensure it is finished before we allow our data
structures to be cleaned up.
