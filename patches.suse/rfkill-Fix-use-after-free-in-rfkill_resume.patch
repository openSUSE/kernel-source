Subject: [PATCH] rfkill: Fix use-after-free in rfkill_resume()
Git-commit: 94e2bd0b259ed39a755fdded47e6734acf1ce464
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc5
References: git-fixes

If a device is getting removed or reprobed during resume, use-after-free
might happen. For example, h5_btrtl_resume() schedules a work queue for
device reprobing, which of course requires removal first.

If the removal happens in parallel with the device_resume() and wins the
race to acquire device_lock(), removal may remove the device from the PM
lists and all, but device_resume() is already running and will continue
when the lock can be acquired, thus calling rfkill_resume().

During this, if rfkill_set_block() is then called after the corresponding
*_unregister() and kfree() are called, there will be an use-after-free
in hci_rfkill_set_block():

Bug: KASAN: use-after-free in hci_rfkill_set_block+0x58/0xc0 [bluetooth]

  device_resume+0x210/0x22c

Fix this by checking rfkill->registered in rfkill_resume(). device_del()
in rfkill_unregister() requires device_lock() and the whole rfkill_resume()
is also protected by the same lock via device_resume(), we can make sure
either the rfkill->registered is false before rfkill_resume() starts or the
rfkill device won't be unregistered before rfkill_resume() returns.

As async_resume() holds a reference to the device, at this level there can
be no use-after-free; only in the user that doesn't expect this scenario.
