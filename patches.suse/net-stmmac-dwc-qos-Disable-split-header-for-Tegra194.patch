Subject: net: stmmac: dwc-qos: Disable split header for Tegra194
Git-commit: 029c1c2059e9c4b38f97a06204cdecd10cfbeb8a
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc7
References: bsc#1194904 CVE-2022-49642 bsc#1238437

There is a long-standing issue with the Synopsys DWC Ethernet driver
for Tegra194 where random system crashes have been observed [0]. The
problem occurs when the split header feature is enabled in the stmmac
driver. In the bad case, a larger than expected buffer length is
received and causes the calculation of the total buffer length to
overflow. This results in a very large buffer length that causes the
kernel to crash. Why this larger buffer length is received is not clear,
however, the feedback from the NVIDIA design team is that the split
header feature is not supported for Tegra194. Therefore, disable split
header support for Tegra194 to prevent these random crashes from
occurring.
