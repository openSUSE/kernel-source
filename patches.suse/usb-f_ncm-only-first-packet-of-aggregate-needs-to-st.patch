Subject: usb: f_ncm: only first packet of aggregate needs to start timer

Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc6
References: git-fixes

The reasoning for this change is that if we already had
a packet pending, then we also already had a pending timer,
and as such there is no need to reschedule it.

This also prevents packets getting delayed 60 ms worst case
under a tiny packet every 290us transmit load, by keeping the
timeout always relative to the first queued up packet.
(300us delay * 16KB max aggregation / 80 byte packet =~ 60 ms)

As such the first packet is now at most delayed by 300us.

Under low transmit load, this will simply result in us sending
a shorter aggregate, as originally intended.

This patch has the benefit of greatly reducing (by ~10 factor
with 1500 byte frames aggregated into 16 kiB) the number of
(potentially pretty costly) updates to the hrtimer.
