Subject: [PATCH] ext4: fix race between ext4_sync_parent() and rename()
Git-commit: 08adf452e628b0e2ce9a01048cfbec52353703d7
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
References: bsc#1173838

'igrab(d_inode(dentry->d_parent))' without holding dentry->d_lock is
broken because without d_lock, d_parent can be concurrently changed due
to a rename().  Then if the old directory is immediately deleted, old
d_parent->inode can be NULL.  That causes a NULL dereference in igrab().

To fix this, use dget_parent() to safely grab a reference to the parent
dentry, which pins the inode.  This also eliminates the need to use
d_find_any_alias() other than for the initial inode, as we no longer
throw away the dentry at each step.

This is an extremely hard race to hit, but it is possible.  Adding a
udelay() in between the reads of ->d_parent and its ->d_inode makes it
reproducible on a no-journal filesystem using the following program:

    #include <fcntl.h>
    #include <unistd.h>

    int main()
    {
        if (fork()) {
            for (;;) {
                mkdir("dir1", 0700);
                int fd = open("dir1/file", O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_SYNC);
                write(fd, "X", 1);
                close(fd);
            }
        } else {
            mkdir("dir2", 0700);
            for (;;) {
                rename("dir1/file", "dir2/file");
                rmdir("dir1");
            }
        }
    }
