Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: pcm: fix incorrect hw_base increase
Git-commit: e7513c5786f8b33f0c107b3759e433bc6cbb2efa
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc7
References: git-fixes

There is a corner case that ALSA keeps increasing the hw_ptr but DMA
already stop working/updating the position for a long time.

In following log we can see the position returned from DMA driver does
not move at all but the hw_ptr got increased at some point of time so
snd_pcm_avail() will return a large number which seems to be a buffer
underrun event from user space program point of view. The program
thinks there is space in the buffer and fill more data.

[  418.510086] sound pcmC0D5p: pos 96 hw_ptr 96 appl_ptr 4096 avail 12368
[  418.510149] sound pcmC0D5p: pos 96 hw_ptr 96 appl_ptr 6910 avail 9554
...
[  418.681052] sound pcmC0D5p: pos 96 hw_ptr 96 appl_ptr 15102 avail 1362
[  418.681130] sound pcmC0D5p: pos 96 hw_ptr 96 appl_ptr 16464 avail 0
[  418.726515] sound pcmC0D5p: pos 96 hw_ptr 16464 appl_ptr 16464 avail 16368

This is because the hw_base will be increased by runtime->buffer_size
frames unconditionally if the hw_ptr is not updated for over half of
buffer time. As the hw_base increases, so does the hw_ptr increased
by the same number.

The avail value returned from snd_pcm_avail() could exceed the limit
(buffer_size) easily becase the hw_ptr itself got increased by same
buffer_size samples when the corner case happens. In following log,
the buffer_size is 16368 samples but the avail is 21810 samples so
CRAS server complains about it.

[  418.851755] sound pcmC0D5p: pos 96 hw_ptr 16464 appl_ptr 27390 avail 5442
[  418.926491] sound pcmC0D5p: pos 96 hw_ptr 32832 appl_ptr 27390 avail 21810

Cras_server[1907]: pcm_avail returned frames larger than buf_size:
Sof-glkda7219max: :0,5: 21810 > 16368

By updating runtime->hw_ptr_jiffies each time the HWSYNC is called,
the hw_base will keep the same when buffer stall happens at long as
the interval between each HWSYNC call is shorter than half of buffer
time.

Following is a log captured by a patched kernel. The hw_base/hw_ptr
value is fixed in this corner case and user space program should be
aware of the buffer stall and handle it.
