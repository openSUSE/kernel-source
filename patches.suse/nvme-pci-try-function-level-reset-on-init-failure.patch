Subject: nvme-pci: try function level reset on init failure
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc1
Git-commit: 5b2c214a95942f7997d1916a4c44017becbc3cac
References: git-fixes

NVMe devices from multiple vendors appear to get stuck in a reset state
that we can't get out of with an NVMe level Controller Reset. The kernel
would report these with messages that look like:

  Device not ready; aborting reset, CSTS=0x1

These have historically required a power cycle to make them usable
again, but in many cases, a PCIe FLR is sufficient to restart operation
without a power cycle. Try it if the initial controller reset fails
during any nvme reset attempt.
