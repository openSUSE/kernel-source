Subject: drm/i915/gt: Wait longer for tasks in migrate selftest
Git-commit: fb4e4c5e38583a2c6526ce9fb81ddc1f0831087c
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: jsc#PED-3527 jsc#PED-5475 jsc#PED-6068 jsc#PED-6070 jsc#PED-6116 jsc#PED-6120 jsc#PED-5065 jsc#PED-5477 jsc#PED-5511 jsc#PED-6041 jsc#PED-6069 jsc#PED-6071

The thread_global_copy subtest of the live migrate selftest creates a
large number of threads and waits 10ms for them all to start.  This is
not enough time to wait for the threaded tasks to start, as some may
need to wait for additional ring space to be granted.  Threads that do
so are at risk of getting stopped (signaled) in the middle of waiting
for additional space, which can result in ERESTARTSYS getting reported
erroneously by i915_request_wait.

Instead of waiting a flat 10ms for the threads to start, wait 10ms per
thread.  This grants enough of a buffer for each thread to wait for
additional ring space when needed.
