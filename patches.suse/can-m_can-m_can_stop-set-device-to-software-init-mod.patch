Subject: [PATCH] can: m_can: m_can_stop(): set device to software init mode before closing
Git-commit: a584e9bc1b7e88f24f8504886eafbe6c73d8a97c
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc5
References: git-fixes

[ backport note: changed the argument for m_can_config_endisable() -- tiwai ]

There might be some requests pending in the buffer when the interface close
sequence occurs. In some devices, these pending requests might lead to the
module not shutting down properly when m_can_clk_stop() is called.

Therefore, move the device to init state before potentially powering it down.
