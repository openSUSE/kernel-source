Subject: drm/dp: Clarify that wait_hpd_asserted() is not optional for panels
Git-commit: 6376eb8b911534735fec104c1a0d780e4cf3116a
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc1
References: jsc#PED-9898 jsc#PED-10191 jsc#PED-10197 jsc#PED-10226 jsc#PED-10237 jsc#PED-10340 jsc#PED-10852 jsc#PED-11022

In response to my patch removing the "wait for HPD" logic at the
beginning of the MSM DP transfer() callback [1], we had some debate
about what the "This is an optional function" meant in the
documentation of the wait_hpd_asserted() callback. Let's clarify.

As talked about in the MSM DP patch [1], before wait_hpd_asserted()
was introduced there was no great way for panel drivers to wait for
HPD in the case that the "built-in" HPD signal was used. Panel drivers
could only wait for HPD if a GPIO was used. At the time, we ended up
just saying that if we were using the "built-in" HPD signal that DP
AUX controllers needed to wait for HPD themselves at the beginning of
their transfer() callback. The fact that the wait for HPD at the
beginning of transfer() was awkward/problematic was the whole reason
wait_hpd_asserted() was added.

Let's make it obvious that if a DP AUX controller implements
wait_hpd_asserted() that they don't need a loop waiting for HPD at the
start of their transfer() function. We'll still allow DP controllers
to work the old way but mark it as deprecated.
