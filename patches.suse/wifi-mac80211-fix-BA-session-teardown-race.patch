Subject: [PATCH] wifi: mac80211: fix BA session teardown race
Git-commit: 05f136220d17839eb7c155f015ace9152f603225
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: bsc#1227149

As previously reported by Alexander, whose commit 69403bad97aa
("wifi: mac80211: sdata can be NULL during AMPDU start") I'm
reverting as part of this commit, there's a race between station
destruction and aggregation setup, where the aggregation setup
can happen while the station is being removed and queue the work
after ieee80211_sta_tear_down_BA_sessions() has already run in
__sta_info_destroy_part1(), and thus the worker will run with a
now freed station. In his case, this manifested in a NULL sdata
pointer, but really there's no guarantee whatsoever.

The real issue seems to be that it's possible at all to have a
situation where this occurs - we want to stop the BA sessions
when doing _part1, but we cannot be sure, and WLAN_STA_BLOCK_BA
isn't necessarily effective since we don't know that the setup
isn't concurrently running and already got past the check.

Simply call ieee80211_sta_tear_down_BA_sessions() again in the
second part of station destruction, since at that point really
nothing else can hold a reference to the station any more.

Also revert the sdata checks since those are just misleading at
this point.
