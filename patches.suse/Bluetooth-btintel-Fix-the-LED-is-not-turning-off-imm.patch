Subject: [PATCH] Bluetooth: btintel: Fix the LED is not turning off immediately
Git-commit: ffcba827c0a1d81933d4fdc35b925d150cee7dec
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-19360

Some platforms have an issue with BT LED when the interface is
down or BT radio is turned off, which takes 5 seconds to BT LED
goes off. This command turns off the BT LED immediately.

This patch sends the Intel vendor command to turn off the LED.
