Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/pseries: Fix hcall tracing recursion in pv queued
 spinlocks

References: bsc#1185110 ltc#192091
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc2
Git-commit: 2c8c89b95831f46a2fb31a8d0fef4601694023ce

The paravit queued spinlock slow path adds itself to the queue then
calls pv_wait to wait for the lock to become free. This is implemented
by calling H_CONFER to donate cycles.

When hcall tracing is enabled, this H_CONFER call can lead to a spin
lock being taken in the tracing code, which will result in the lock to
be taken again, which will also go to the slow path because it queues
behind itself and so won't ever make progress.

An example trace of a deadlock:

  __pv_queued_spin_lock_slowpath
  trace_clock_global
  ring_buffer_lock_reserve
  trace_event_buffer_lock_reserve
  trace_event_buffer_reserve
  trace_event_raw_event_hcall_exit
  __trace_hcall_exit
  plpar_hcall_norets_trace
  __pv_queued_spin_lock_slowpath
  trace_clock_global
  ring_buffer_lock_reserve
  trace_event_buffer_lock_reserve
  trace_event_buffer_reserve
  trace_event_raw_event_rcu_dyntick
  rcu_irq_exit
  irq_exit
  __do_irq
  call_do_irq
  do_IRQ
  hardware_interrupt_common_virt

Fix this by introducing plpar_hcall_norets_notrace(), and using that to
make SPLPAR virtual processor dispatching hcalls by the paravirt
spinlock code.
