Subject: drm: handle kernel fences in drm_gem_plane_helper_prepare_fb v2
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: 1ea28bc5542d607ff7c806e409a72862c5af8f5e
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

drm_gem_plane_helper_prepare_fb() was using
drm_atomic_set_fence_for_plane() which ignores all implicit fences when an
explicit fence is already set. That's rather unfortunate when the fb still
has a kernel fence we need to wait for to avoid presenting garbage on the
screen.

So instead update the fence in the plane state directly. While at it also
take care of all potential GEM objects and not just the first one.

Also remove the now unused drm_atomic_set_fence_for_plane() function, new
drivers should probably use the atomic helpers directly.

v2: improve kerneldoc, use local variable and num_planes, WARN_ON_ONCE
    on missing planes.
