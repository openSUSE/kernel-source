Subject: drm: two planes with the same zpos have undefined ordering
Git-commit: 8f6ea27b2fefdff58b3a038b5f1b4ed34aed3fd3
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: bsc#1152489

Currently the property docs don't specify whether it's okay for two planes to
have the same zpos value and what user-space should expect in this case.

The unspoken, legacy rule used in the past was to make user-space figure
out the zpos from object IDs. However some drivers break this rule,
that's why the ordering is documented as unspecified in case the zpos
property is missing. User-space should rely on the zpos property only.

There are some cases in which user-space might read identical zpos
values for different planes.

For instance, in case the property is mutable, user-space might set two
planes' zpos to the same value. This is necessary to support user-space
using the legacy DRM API where atomic commits are not possible:
user-space needs to update the planes' zpos one by one.

Because of this, user-space should handle multiple planes with the same
zpos.

While at it, remove the assumption that zpos is only for overlay planes.

Additionally, update the drm_plane_state.zpos docs to clarify that zpos
disambiguation via plane object IDs is a recommendation for drivers, not
something user-space can rely on. In other words, when user-space sets
the same zpos on two planes, drivers should rely on the plane object ID.

v2: clarify drm_plane_state.zpos docs (Daniel)

v3: zpos is for all planes (Marius, Daniel)

v4: completely reword the drm_plane_state.zpos docs to make it clear the
recommendation to use plane IDs is for drivers in case user-space uses
duplicate zpos values (Pekka)

v5: reword commit message (Pekka, James)

v6: remove mention of Arm GPUs having planes which can't overlap,
because this isn't uAPI yet (Daniel)
