Subject: [PATCH] clk: Fix clk_core_get NULL dereference
Git-commit: e97fe4901e0f59a0bfd524578fe3768f8ca42428
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: git-fixes

It is possible for clk_core_get to dereference a NULL in the following
Sequence: 

clk_core_get()
    of_clk_get_hw_from_clkspec()
        __of_clk_get_hw_from_provider()
            __clk_get_hw()

__clk_get_hw() can return NULL which is dereferenced by clk_core_get() at
hw->core.

Prior to commit dde4eff47c82 ("clk: Look for parents with clkdev based
clk_lookups") the check IS_ERR_OR_NULL() was performed which would have
caught the NULL.

Reading the description of this function it talks about returning NULL but
that cannot be so at the moment.

Update the function to check for hw before dereferencing it and return NULL
if hw is NULL.
