Subject: x86/speculation/swapgs: Check FSGSBASE in enabling SWAPGS mitigation
Git-commit: 978e1342c3c4d7b20808fd5875d9ac0d57db22ee
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-14846

Before enabling FSGSBASE the kernel could safely assume that the content
of GS base was a user address. Thus any speculative access as the result
of a mispredicted branch controlling the execution of SWAPGS would be to
a user address. So systems with speculation-proof SMAP did not need to
add additional LFENCE instructions to mitigate.

With FSGSBASE enabled a hostile user can set GS base to a kernel address.
So they can make the kernel speculatively access data they wish to leak
via a side channel. This means that SMAP provides no protection.

Add FSGSBASE as an additional condition to enable the fence-based SWAPGS
mitigation.
