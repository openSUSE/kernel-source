Subject: [PATCH] Bluetooth: hci_event: Fix handling of HCI_EV_LE_DIRECT_ADV_REPORT
Git-commit: 3a7fdfb7d876910cfe734488f553dbbc938f8f16
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc1
References: bsc#1240857

Some controllers seems to generate HCI_EV_LE_DIRECT_ADV_REPORT even when
scan_filter is not set to 0x02 or 0x03, which indicates that local
privacy is enabled, causing them to be ignored thus breaking
auto-connect logic:

< HCI Command: LE Set Scan Parameters (0x08|0x000b) plen 7
        Type: Passive (0x00)
        Interval: 60.000 msec (0x0060)
        Window: 30.000 msec (0x0030)
        Own address type: Public (0x00)
        Filter policy: Ignore not in accept list (0x01)
...
> HCI Event: LE Meta Event (0x3e) plen 18
      LE Direct Advertising Report (0x0b)
        Num reports: 1
        Event type: Connectable directed - ADV_DIRECT_IND (0x01)
        Address type: Random (0x01)
        Address: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX (Static)
        Direct address type: Random (0x01)
        Direct address: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX (Non-Resolvable)
        RSSI: -54 dBm (0xca)

So this attempts to mitigate the above problem by skipping checking of
direct_addr if local privacy is not enabled.
