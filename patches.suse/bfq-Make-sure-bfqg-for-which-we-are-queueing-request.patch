Subject: [PATCH 9/9] bfq: Make sure bfqg for which we are queueing requests is
 online
References: bsc#1197926 CVE-2022-49411 bsc#1238307
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
Git-commit: 075a53b78b815301f8d3dd1ee2cd99554e34f0dd

Bios queued into BFQ IO scheduler can be associated with a cgroup that
was already offlined. This may then cause insertion of this bfq_group
into a service tree. But this bfq_group will get freed as soon as last
bio associated with it is completed leading to use after free issues for
service tree users. Fix the problem by making sure we always operate on
online bfq_group. If the bfq_group associated with the bio is not
online, we pick the first online parent.
