Subject: x86/fpu: Preserve supervisor states in
 sanitize_restored_user_xstate()
Git-commit: 9301982c424a003c0095bf157154a85bf5322bd0
Patch-mainline: v5.13
References: bsc#1178134

sanitize_restored_user_xstate() preserves the supervisor states only
when the fx_only argument is zero, which allows unprivileged user space
to put supervisor states back into init state.

Preserve them unconditionally.

 [ bp: Fix a typo or two in the text. ]
