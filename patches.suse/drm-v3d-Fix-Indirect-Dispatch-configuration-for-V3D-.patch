`args->cfg[4]` is configured in Indirect Dispatch using the number of
batches. Currently, for all V3D tech versions, `args->cfg[4]` equals the
number of batches subtracted by 1. But, for V3D 7.1.6 and later, we must not
subtract 1 from the number of batches.

Implement the fix by checking the V3D tech version and revision.

Fixes several `dEQP-VK.synchronization*` CTS tests related to Indirect Dispatch.
