Subject: samples/bpf, xdpsock: Fix race when running for fix duration of time

References: jsc#PED-1368

When running xdpsock for a fix duration of time before terminating
using --duration=<n>, there is a race condition that may cause xdpsock
to terminate immediately.

When running for a fixed duration of time the check to determine when to
terminate execution is in is_benchmark_done() and is being executed in
the context of the poller thread,

    if (opt_duration > 0) {
            unsigned long dt = (get_nsecs() - start_time);

            if (dt >= opt_duration)
                    benchmark_done = true;
    }

However start_time is only set after the poller thread have been
created. This leaves a small window when the poller thread is starting
and calls is_benchmark_done() for the first time that start_time is not
yet set. In that case start_time have its initial value of 0 and the
duration check fails as it do not correlate correctly for the
applications start time and immediately sets benchmark_done which in
turn terminates the xdpsock application.

Fix this by setting start_time before creating the poller thread.
