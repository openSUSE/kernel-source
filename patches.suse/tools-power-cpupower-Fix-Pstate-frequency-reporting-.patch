Subject: [PATCH] tools/power/cpupower: Fix Pstate frequency reporting on AMD Family 1Ah CPUs
Git-commit: 43cad521c6d228ea0c51e248f8e5b3a6295a2849
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc3
References: stable-fixes

Update cpupower's P-State frequency calculation and reporting with AMD
Family 1Ah+ processors, when using the acpi-cpufreq driver. This is due
to a change in the PStateDef MSR layout in AMD Family 1Ah+.

Tested on 4th and 5th Gen AMD EPYC system
