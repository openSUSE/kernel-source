Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: Intel: sof_sdw: Add space for a terminator into DAIs array
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-transfer-encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: 255cc582e6e16191a20d54bcdbca6c91d3e90c5e
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc3
References: git-fixes CVE-2024-57880 bsc#1235800

The code uses the initialised member of the asoc_sdw_dailink struct to
determine if a member of the array is in use. However in the case the
array is completely full this will lead to an access 1 past the end of
the array, expand the array by one entry to include a space for a
terminator.
