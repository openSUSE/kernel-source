Subject: [PATCH] dm: report suspended device during destroy
Git-commit: adc0daad366b62ca1bce3e2958a40b0b71a8b8b3
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc5
References: git fixes (block layer)

The function dm_suspended returns true if the target is suspended.
However, when the target is being suspended during unload, it returns
false.

An example where this is a problem: the test "!dm_suspended(wc->ti)" in
writecache_writeback is not sufficient, because dm_suspended returns
zero while writecache_suspend is in progress.  As is, without an
enhanced dm_suspended, simply switching from flush_workqueue to
drain_workqueue still emits warnings:
workqueue writecache-writeback: drain_workqueue() isn't complete after 10 tries
workqueue writecache-writeback: drain_workqueue() isn't complete after 100 tries
workqueue writecache-writeback: drain_workqueue() isn't complete after 200 tries
workqueue writecache-writeback: drain_workqueue() isn't complete after 300 tries
workqueue writecache-writeback: drain_workqueue() isn't complete after 400 tries

writecache_suspend calls flush_workqueue(wc->writeback_wq) - this function
flushes the current work. However, the workqueue may re-queue itself and
flush_workqueue doesn't wait for re-queued works to finish. Because of
this - the function writecache_writeback continues execution after the
device was suspended and then concurrently with writecache_dtr, causing
a crash in writecache_writeback.

We must use drain_workqueue - that waits until the work and all re-queued
works finish.

As a prereq for switching to drain_workqueue, this commit fixes
dm_suspended to return true after the presuspend hook and before the
postsuspend hook - just like during a normal suspend. It allows
simplifying the dm-integrity and dm-writecache targets so that they
don't have to maintain suspended flags on their own.

With this change use of drain_workqueue() can be used effectively.  This
change was tested with the lvm2 testsuite and cryptsetup testsuite and
the are no regressions.
