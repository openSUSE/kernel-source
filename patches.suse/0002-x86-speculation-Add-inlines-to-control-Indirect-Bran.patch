Subject: x86/speculation: Add inlines to control Indirect Branch Speculation
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/djbw/linux.git
Git-commit: dd9ea1967a0679ae7c44792923c046c950e762f8
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
References: bsc#1068032 CVE-2017-5753

XX: I am utterly unconvinced that having "friendly, self-explanatory"
    names for the IBRS-frobbing inlines is useful. There be dragons
    here for anyone who isn't intimately familiar with what's going
    on, and it's almost better to just call it IBRS, put a reference
    to the spec, and have a clear "you must be →this← tall to ride."

[karahmed: switch to using ALTERNATIVES instead of static_cpu_has]
[dwmw2: wrmsr args inside the ALTERNATIVE again, bikeshed naming]
