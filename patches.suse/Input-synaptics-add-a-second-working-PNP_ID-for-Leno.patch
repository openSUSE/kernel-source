Subject: [PATCH] Input: synaptics - add a second working PNP_ID for Lenovo T470s
Git-commit: 642aa86eaf8f1e6fe894f20fd7f12f0db52ee03c
Patch-mainline: v5.7
References: git-fixes

The Lenovo Thinkpad T470s I own has a different touchpad with "LEN007a"
instead of the already included PNP ID "LEN006c". However, my touchpad
seems to work well without any problems using RMI. So this patch adds the
other PNP ID.
