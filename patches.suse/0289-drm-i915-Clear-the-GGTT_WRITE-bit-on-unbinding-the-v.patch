Subject: drm/i915: Clear the GGTT_WRITE bit on unbinding the vma
Git-commit: 5424f5d79472c5c20500e8d3eee356a4c6fef3d9
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-12680, jsc#SLE-12880, jsc#SLE-12882, jsc#SLE-12883, jsc#SLE-13496, jsc#SLE-15322

While we do flush writes to the vma before unbinding (to make sure they
go through the right detiling register), we may also be concurrently
poking at the GGTT_WRITE bit from set-domain, as we mark all GGTT vma
associated with an object. We know this is for another vma, as we
are currently unbinding this one -- so if this vma will be reused, it
will be refaulted and have its dirty bit set before the next write.
