Subject: PCI: pciehp: Fix MSI interrupt race
Git-commit: 8edf5332c39340b9583cf9cba659eb7ec71f75b5
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: bsc#1159037

Without this commit, a PCIe hotplug port can stop generating interrupts on
hotplug events, so device adds and removals will not be seen:

The pciehp interrupt handler pciehp_isr() reads the Slot Status register
and then writes back to it to clear the bits that caused the interrupt.  If
a different interrupt event bit gets set between the read and the write,
pciehp_isr() returns without having cleared all of the interrupt event
bits.  If this happens when the MSI isn't masked (which by default it isn't
in handle_edge_irq(), and which it will never be when MSI per-vector
masking is not supported), we won't get any more hotplug interrupts from
that device.

That is expected behavior, according to the PCIe Base Spec r5.0, section
6.7.3.4, "Software Notification of Hot-Plug Events".

Because the Presence Detect Changed and Data Link Layer State Changed event
bits can both get set at nearly the same time when a device is added or
removed, this is more likely to happen than it might seem.  The issue was
found (and can be reproduced rather easily) by connecting and disconnecting
an NVMe storage device on at least one system model where the NVMe devices
were being connected to an AMD PCIe port (PCI device 0x1022/0x1483).

Fix the issue by modifying pciehp_isr() to loop back and re-read the Slot
Status register immediately after writing to it, until it sees that all of
the event status bits have been cleared.

[lukas: drop loop count limitation, write "events" instead of "status",
don't loop back in INTx and poll modes, tweak code comment & commit msg]
