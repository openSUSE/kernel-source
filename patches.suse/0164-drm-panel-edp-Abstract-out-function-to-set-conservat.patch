Subject: drm/panel-edp: Abstract out function to set conservative timings
Git-commit: 2cbee8ae55f50da7c6f1f2af53c452c8e3b48290
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc1
References: jsc#PED-9898 jsc#PED-10191 jsc#PED-10197 jsc#PED-10226 jsc#PED-10237 jsc#PED-10340 jsc#PED-10852 jsc#PED-11022

If we're using the generic "edp-panel" compatible string and we fail
to detect an eDP panel then we fall back to conservative timings for
powering up and powering down the panel. Abstract out the function for
setting these timings so it can be used in future patches.

No functional change expected--just code movement.
