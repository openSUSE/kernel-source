Subject: video: screen_info: Update framebuffers behind PCI bridges
Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 09:27:33 +0200
Patch-mainline: Submitted, dri-devel ML
References: bsc#1240696

Apply bridge window offsets to screen_info framebuffers during
relocation. Fixes invalid access to I/O memory.

Resources behind a PCI bridge can be located at a certain offset
in the kernel's I/O range. The framebuffer memory range stored in
screen_info refers to the offset as seen during boot (essentialy 0).
During boot up, the kernel may assign a different memory offset to
the bridge device and thereby relocating the framebuffer address of
the PCI graphics device as seen by the kernel. The information in
screen_info must be updated as well.

The helper pcibios_bus_to_resource() performs the relocation of
the screen_info resource. The result now matches the I/O-memory
resource of the PCI graphics device. As before, we store away the
information necessary to update the information in screen_info.

Commit 78aa89d1dfba ("firmware/sysfb: Update screen_info for relocated
EFI framebuffers") added the code for updating screen_info. It is
based on similar functionality that pre-existed in efifb. But efifb
did not handle bridges correctly, so the problem presumably exists
only on newer systems.
