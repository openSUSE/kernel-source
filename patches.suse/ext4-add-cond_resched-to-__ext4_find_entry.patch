Subject: [PATCH] ext4: add cond_resched() to __ext4_find_entry()
Git-commit: 9424ef56e13a1f14c57ea161eed3ecfdc7b2770e
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc3
References: bsc#1166862

We tested a soft lockup problem in linux 4.19 which could also
be found in linux 5.x.

When dir inode takes up a large number of blocks, and if the
directory is growing when we are searching, it's possible the
restart branch could be called many times, and the do while loop
could hold cpu a long time.

Here is the call trace in linux 4.19.

Add cond_resched() to avoid soft lockup and to provide a better
system responding.
