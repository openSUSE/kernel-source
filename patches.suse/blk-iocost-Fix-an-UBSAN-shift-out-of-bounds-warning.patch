Subject: [PATCH] blk-iocost: Fix an UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds warning

References: bsc#1234144

When iocg_kick_delay() is called from a CPU different than the one which set
the delay, @now may be in the past of @iocg->delay_at leading to the
following warning:

  UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in block/blk-iocost.c:1359:23
  shift exponent 18446744073709 is too large for 64-bit type 'u64' (aka 'unsigned long long')
  ...
  Call Trace:

The underflow itself doesn't really affect the behavior in any meaningful
way; however, the past timestamp may exaggerate the delay amount calculated
later in the code, which shouldn't be a material problem given the nature of
the delay mechanism.

If @now is in the past, this CPU is racing another CPU which recently set up
the delay and there's nothing this CPU can contribute w.r.t. the delay.
Let's bail early from iocg_kick_delay() in such cases.
