Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: usb-audio: Fix potential use-after-free of streams
Git-commit: ff58bbc7b9704a5869204176f804eff57307fef0
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc3
References: git-fixes

With the recent full-duplex support of implicit feedback streams, an
endpoint can be still running after closing the capture stream as long
as the playback stream with the sync-endpoint is running.  In such a
state, the URBs are still be handled and they may call retire_data_urb
callback, which tries to transfer the data from the PCM buffer.  Since
the PCM stream gets closed, this may lead to use-after-free.

This patch adds the proper clearance of the callback at stopping the
capture stream for addressing the possible UAF above.
