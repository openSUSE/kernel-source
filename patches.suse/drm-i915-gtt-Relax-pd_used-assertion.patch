Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915/gtt: Relax pd_used assertion
Git-commit: 6acbe9f630913a7ff433d7a5f30d3300fc4e0a94
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-7953

The current assertion tries to make sure that we do not over count the
number of used PDE inside a page directory -- that is with an array of
512 pde, we do not expect more than 512 elements used! However, our
assertion has to take into account that as we pin an element into the
page directory, the caller first pins the page directory so the usage
count is one higher. However, this should be one extra pin per thread,
and the upper bound is that we may have one thread for each entry.
