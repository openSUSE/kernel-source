Subject: drm/i915: Hold reference to intel_context over life of i915_request
Git-commit: 1e98d8c52ed5dfbaf273c4423c636525c2ce59e7
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

Hold a reference to the intel_context over life of an i915_request.
Without this an i915_request can exist after the context has been
destroyed (e.g. request retired, context closed, but user space holds a
reference to the request from an out fence). In the case of GuC
submission + virtual engine, the engine that the request references is
also destroyed which can trigger bad pointer dref in fence ops (e.g.
i915_fence_get_driver_name). We could likely change
i915_fence_get_driver_name to avoid touching the engine but let's just
be safe and hold the intel_context reference.

v2:
 (John Harrison)
  - Update comment explaining how GuC mode and execlists mode deal with
    virtual engines differently

-	 * engine here. Not that we would want to, as the only consumer of
-	 * the reserved engine->request_pool is the power management parking,
-	 * which must-not-fail, and that is only run on the physical engines.
-	 *
-	 * Since the request must have been executed to be have completed,
-	 * we know that it will have been processed by the HW and will
-	 * not be unsubmitted again, so rq->engine and rq->execution_mask
-	 * at this point is stable. rq->execution_mask will be a single
-	 * bit if the last and _only_ engine it could execution on was a
-	 * physical engine, if it's multiple bits then it started on and
-	 * could still be on a virtual engine. Thus if the mask is not a
-	 * power-of-two we assume that rq->engine may still be a virtual
-	 * engine and so a dangling invalid pointer that we cannot dereference
-	 *
-	 * For example, consider the flow of a bonded request through a virtual
-	 * engine. The request is created with a wide engine mask (all engines
-	 * that we might execute on). On processing the bond, the request mask
-	 * is reduced to one or more engines. If the request is subsequently
-	 * bound to a single engine, it will then be constrained to only
-	 * execute on that engine and never returned to the virtual engine
-	 * after timeslicing away, see __unwind_incomplete_requests(). Thus we
-	 * know that if the rq->execution_mask is a single bit, rq->engine
-	 * can be a physical engine with the exact corresponding mask.
+	 * Keep one request on each engine for reserved use under mempressure,
+	 * do not use with virtual engines as this really is only needed for
+	 * kernel contexts.
