Subject: [PATCH] usb: xhci: Don't change the status of stalled TDs on failed Stop EP
Git-commit: dfc88357b6b6356dadea06b2c0bc8041f5e11720
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc1
References: stable-fixes

When the device stalls an endpoint, current TD is assigned -EPIPE
status and Reset Endpoint is queued. If a Stop Endpoint is pending
at the time, it will run before Reset Endpoint and fail due to the
stall. Its handler will change TD's status to -EPROTO before Reset
Endpoint handler runs and initiates giveback.

Check if the stall has already been handled and don't try to do it
again. Since xhci_handle_halted_endpoint() performs this check too,
not overwriting td->status is the only difference.

I haven't seen this case yet, but I have seen a related one where
the xHC has already executed Reset Endpoint, EP Context state is
now Stopped and EP_HALTED is set. If the xHC took a bit longer to
execute Reset Endpoint, said case would become this one.
