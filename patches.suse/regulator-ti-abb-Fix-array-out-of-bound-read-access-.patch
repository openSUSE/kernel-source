Subject: [PATCH] regulator: ti-abb: Fix array out of bound read access on the first transition
Git-commit: 2ba546ebe0ce2af47833d8912ced9b4a579f13cb
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc5
References: git-fixes

At the start of driver initialization, we do not know what bias
setting the bootloader has configured the system for and we only know
for certain the very first time we do a transition.

However, since the initial value of the comparison index is -EINVAL,
this negative value results in an array out of bound access on the
very first transition.

Since we don't know what the setting is, we just set the bias
configuration as there is nothing to compare against. This prevents
the array out of bound access.

Note: Even though we could use a more relaxed check of "< 0" the only
valid values(ignoring cosmic ray induced bitflips) are -EINVAL, 0+.
