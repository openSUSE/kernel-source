Subject: [PATCH] acpi: nfit: vmalloc-out-of-bounds Read in acpi_nfit_ctl
Git-commit: 265e98f72bac6c41a4492d3e30a8e5fd22fe0779
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc3
References: git-fixes CVE-2024-56662 bsc#1235533

Fix an issue detected by syzbot with KASAN:

Bug: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds in cmd_to_func drivers/acpi/nfit/
core.c:416 [inline]
Bug: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds in acpi_nfit_ctl+0x20e8/0x24a0
drivers/acpi/nfit/core.c:459

The issue occurs in cmd_to_func when the call_pkg->nd_reserved2
array is accessed without verifying that call_pkg points to a buffer
that is appropriately sized as a struct nd_cmd_pkg. This can lead
to out-of-bounds access and undefined behavior if the buffer does not
have sufficient space.

To address this, a check was added in acpi_nfit_ctl() to ensure that
buf is not NULL and that buf_len is less than sizeof(*call_pkg)
before accessing it. This ensures safe access to the members of
call_pkg, including the nd_reserved2 array.
