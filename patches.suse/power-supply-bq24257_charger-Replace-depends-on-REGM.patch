Subject: [PATCH] power: supply: bq24257_charger: Replace depends on REGMAP_I2C with select
Git-commit: 87c3d579c8ed0eaea6b1567d529a8daa85a2bc6c
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
References: git-fixes

regmap is a library function that gets selected by drivers that need
it. No driver modules should depend on it. Depending on REGMAP_I2C makes
this driver only build if another driver already selected REGMAP_I2C,
as the symbol can't be selected through the menu kernel configuration.
