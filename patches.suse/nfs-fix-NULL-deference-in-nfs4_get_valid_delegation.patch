Subject: [PATCH] nfs: fix NULL deference in nfs4_get_valid_delegation
Git-commit: 29fe839976266bc7c55b927360a1daae57477723
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc6
References: git-fixes

We add the new state to the nfsi->open_states list, making it
potentially visible to other threads, before we've finished initializing
it.

That wasn't a problem when all the readers were also taking the i_lock
(as we do here), but since we switched to RCU, there's now a possibility
that a reader could see the partially initialized state.

Symptoms observed were a crash when another thread called
nfs4_get_valid_delegation() on a NULL inode, resulting in an oops like:

	BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffffffffffffb0 ...
	RIP: 0010:nfs4_get_valid_delegation+0x6/0x30 [nfsv4] ...
	Call Trace:
	 nfs4_open_prepare+0x80/0x1c0 [nfsv4]
	 __rpc_execute+0x75/0x390 [sunrpc]
	 ? finish_task_switch+0x75/0x260
