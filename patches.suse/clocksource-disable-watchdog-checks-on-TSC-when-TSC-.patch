Subject: [PATCH v2] clocksource: disable watchdog checks on TSC when TSC is
 watchdog
Patch-mainline: Never, ignored by upstream
References: bsc#1215885

Change the semantics of the tsc=watchdog option to always remove the
CLOCK_SOURCE_MUST_VERIFY bit from the TSC clocksource so as to provide an
alternative to the tsc=nowatchdog option, which is used routinely to
prevent switches to the HPET clocksource on machines with hardware issues.

Currently, the TSC does not get checked on machines with a stable TSC (4
NUMA nodes or less, CONSTANT_TSC, NONSTOP_TSC and TSC_ADJUST), and the
tsc=watchdog option allows one to have the PMTMR (acpi_pm) checked
instead. There are production machines that do not quality for having the
clocksource watchdog disabled (usually on account of having more than 4
NUMA nodes) and that also may have a malfunctioning CPU that causes a
watchdog check failure in a few days after a reboot resulting in the
current clocksource being switched to the HPET. Solving a hardware issue
or replacing the machine may take an inordinate amount of time, while the
production machine is still needed to do its job.

It is possible to pass tsc=nowatchdog to the kernel, which disables the
clocksource watchdog on the TSC, effectively leaving the operator of the
production machine blind to any clocksource malfunction. The sematics of
the recently introduced tsc=watchdog option, 0051293c5330 ("clocksource:
Enable TSC watchdog checking of HPET and PMTMR only when requested"), is
changed by this patch so that the TSC does not get checked when
tsc=watchdog is specified regardless of the TSC passing or not passing the
criteria for being judged to be stable. This way, the TSC acts as a
watchdog checking other clocksources (HPET, PMTMR) and a failed check
does not result in the current clocksource (TSC) getting marked unstable.
Passing tsc=watchdog has the advantange of the operator being informed
that the machine may be experiencing clocksource issues.

There is one side effect of the semantic change of tsc=watchdog - it fixes
the HPET not having its CLOCK_SOURCE_MUST_VERIFY bit set as intended by
efc8b329c7fd ("clocksource: Verify HPET and PMTMR when TSC unverified").
When the system is booting up, the HPET does not have its
CLOCK_SOURCE_MUST_VERIFY bit set on account of the order in which
clocksources are initialized in x86_late_time_init(). The HPET
initialization and clocksource registration always comes before the TSC
init function unsets the CLOCK_SOURCE_MUST_VERIFY bit.
