Subject: [PATCH] counter: fix privdata alignment
Git-commit: c83ccdc9586b3e9882da9e27507c046751999d59
Patch-mainline: v6.8
References: git-fixes

Aligning to the L1 cache does not guarantee the same alignment as
kmallocing an object [1]. Furthermore, in some platforms, that
alignment is not sufficient for DMA safety (in case someone wants
to have a DMA safe buffer in privdata) [2].

Sometime ago, we had the same fixes in IIO.
