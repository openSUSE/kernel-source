Subject: accel/habanalabs: use exported size from dma_buf and not from
 phys_pg_pack
Git-commit: efbca048c64bb00562c3e980dfc6ca47fff4fa0e
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: drm-backport-placeholder

The 'exported_size' member in 'struct hl_vm_phys_pg_pack' is used to
keep the exported dma-buf size, to be later used when the buffer is
mapped.
However it is possible that the same phys_pg_pack will be exported more
than once, and independently of when the mapping takes place.
Remove this member from the phys_pg_pack structure, and simply use the
size in the dma-buf object as the exported size when mapping.
