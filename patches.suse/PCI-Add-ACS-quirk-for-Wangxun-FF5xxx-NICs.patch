Subject: [PATCH] PCI: Add ACS quirk for Wangxun FF5xxx NICs
Git-commit: aa46a3736afcb7b0793766d22479b8b99fc1b322
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
References: stable-fixes

Wangxun FF5xxx NICs are similar to SFxxx, RP1000 and RP2000 NICs.  They may
be multi-function devices, but they do not advertise an ACS capability.

But the hardware does isolate FF5xxx functions as though it had an ACS
capability and PCI_ACS_RR and PCI_ACS_CR were set in the ACS Control
register, i.e., all peer-to-peer traffic is directed upstream instead of
being routed internally.

Add ACS quirk for FF5xxx NICs in pci_quirk_wangxun_nic_acs() so the
functions can be in independent IOMMU groups.
