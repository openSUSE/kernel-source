Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/setup_64: Set cache-line-size based on
 cache-block-size

References: bsc#1065729
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc3
Git-commit: 94c0b013c98583614e1ad911e8795ca36da34a85

If {i,d}-cache-block-size is set and {i,d}-cache-line-size is not, use
the block-size value for both. Per the devicetree spec cache-line-size
is only needed if it differs from the block size.

Originally the code would fallback from block size to line size. An
error message was printed if both properties were missing.

Later the code was refactored to use clearer names and logic but it
inadvertently made line size a required property, meaning on systems
without a line size property we fall back to the default from the
cputable.

On powernv (OPAL) platforms, since the introduction of device tree CPU
features (5a61ef74f269 ("powerpc/64s: Support new device tree binding
for discovering CPU features")), that has led to the wrong value being
used, as the fallback value is incorrect for Power8/Power9 CPUs.

The incorrect values flow through to the VDSO and also to the sysconf
values, SC_LEVEL1_ICACHE_LINESIZE etc.
