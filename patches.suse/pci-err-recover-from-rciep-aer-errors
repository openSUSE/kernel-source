Subject: PCI/ERR: Recover from RCiEP AER errors
Git-commit: 5790862255028c831761e13014ee87a06df828f1
Patch-mainline: v5.11-rc1
References: bsc#1174426

Add support for handling AER errors detected by Root Complex Integrated
Endpoints (RCiEPs).  These errors are signaled to software natively via a
Root Complex Event Collector (RCEC) or non-natively via ACPI APEI if the
platform retains control of AER or uses a non-standard RCEC-like device.

When recovering from RCiEP errors, the Root Error Command and Status
registers are in the AER Capability of an associated RCEC (if any), not in
a Root Port.  In the non-native case, the platform is responsible for those
registers and we can't touch them.
