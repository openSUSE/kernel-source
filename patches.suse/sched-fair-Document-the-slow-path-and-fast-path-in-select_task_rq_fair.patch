Subject: [PATCH] sched/fair: Document the slow path and fast path in
 select_task_rq_fair

References: bsc#1189999 (Scheduler functional and performance backports)
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
Git-commit: 2917406c352757642c3c1a13a4c99c96e6d22fde

All People I know including myself took a long time to figure out that
typical wakeup will always go to fast path and never go to slow path
except WF_FORK and WF_EXEC.

Vincent reminded me once in a linaro meeting and made me understand
slow path won't happen for WF_TTWU. But my other friends repeatedly
wasted a lot of time on testing this path like me before I reminded
them.

So obviously the code needs some document.
