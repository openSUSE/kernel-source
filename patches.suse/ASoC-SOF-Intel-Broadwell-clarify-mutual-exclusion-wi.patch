Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: SOF: Intel: Broadwell: clarify mutual exclusion with legacy driver
Git-commit: a6955fe0e2309feeab5ec71e4b0dcbe498f4f497
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: git-fixes

Some distros select all options blindly, which leads to confusion and
bug reports. SOF does not fully support Broadwell due to firmware
dependencies, the machine drivers can only support one option, and
UCM/topology files are still being propagated to downstream distros,
so make SOF on Broadwell an opt-in option that first require distros
to opt-out of existing defaults.

Fixes: f35bf70f61d3 ('ASoC: Intel: Make sure BDW based machine drivers build for SOF')
