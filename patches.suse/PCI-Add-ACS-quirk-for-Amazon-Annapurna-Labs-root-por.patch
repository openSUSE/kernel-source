Subject: PCI: Add ACS quirk for Amazon Annapurna Labs root ports

Git-commit: 76e67e9e0f0f2debf9df192502a759bdd0cb4dab
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: bsc#1152187,bsc#1152525

The Amazon's Annapurna Labs root ports don't advertise an ACS
capability, but they don't allow peer-to-peer transactions and do
validate bus numbers through the SMMU. Additionally, it's not possible
for one RP to pass traffic to another RP.
