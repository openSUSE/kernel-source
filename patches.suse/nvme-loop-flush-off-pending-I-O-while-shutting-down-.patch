Subject: nvme-loop: flush off pending I/O while shutting down loop controller
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc4
Git-commit: c199fac88fe7c749f88a0653e9f621b9f5a71cf1
References: git-fixes

While shutting down loop controller, we first quiesce the admin/IO queue,
delete the admin/IO tag-set and then at last destroy the admin/IO queue.
However it's quite possible that during the window between quiescing and
destroying of the admin/IO queue, some admin/IO request might sneak in
and if that happens then we could potentially encounter a hung task
because shutdown operation can't forward progress until any pending I/O
is flushed off.

This commit helps ensure that before destroying the admin/IO queue, we
unquiesce the admin/IO queue so that any outstanding requests, which are
added after the admin/IO queue is quiesced, are now flushed to its
completion.
