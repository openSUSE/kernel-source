Subject: s390/boot: Use -D__DISABLE_EXPORTS
Git-commit: 819275e18112f682d9ca9b66190fc714a2910a53
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc1
References: bsc#1245126

Files in the arch/s390/boot directory reuse logic from the rest of the
kernel by including certain C and assembly files from the kernel and lib
directories. Some of these included files contain EXPORT_SYMBOL directives.
For instance, arch/s390/boot/cmdline.c includes lib/cmdline.c, which
exports the get_option() function.

This inclusion triggers genksyms processing for the files in
arch/s390/boot, which is unnecessary and slows down the build.
Additionally, when KBUILD_SYMTYPES=1 is set, the generated symtypes data
contain exported symbols that are duplicated with the main kernel. This
duplication can confuse external kABI tools that process the symtypes data.

Address this issue by compiling the files in arch/s390/boot with
-D__DISABLE_EXPORTS.
