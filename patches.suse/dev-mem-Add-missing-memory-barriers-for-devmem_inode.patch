Subject: /dev/mem: Add missing memory barriers for devmem_inode
Git-commit: b34e7e298d7a5ed76b3aa327c240c29f1ef6dd22
Patch-mainline: 5.8-rc7
References: git-fixes

WRITE_ONCE() isn't the correct way to publish a pointer to a data
structure, since it doesn't include a write memory barrier.  Therefore
other tasks may see that the pointer has been set but not see that the
pointed-to memory has finished being initialized yet.  Instead a
primitive with "release" semantics is needed.

Use smp_store_release() for this.

The use of READ_ONCE() on the read side is still potentially correct if
there's no control dependency, i.e. if all memory being "published" is
transitively reachable via the pointer itself.  But this pairing is
somewhat confusing and error-prone.  So just upgrade the read side to
smp_load_acquire() so that it clearly pairs with smp_store_release().
