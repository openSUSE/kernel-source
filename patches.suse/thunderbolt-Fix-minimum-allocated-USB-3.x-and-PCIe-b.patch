Subject: [PATCH] thunderbolt: Fix minimum allocated USB 3.x and PCIe bandwidth
Git-commit: f0b94c1c5c7994a74e487f43c91cfc922105a423
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc7
References: git-fixes

With the current bandwidth allocation we end up reserving too much for the USB
3.x and PCIe tunnels that leads to reduced capabilities for the second
DisplayPort tunnel.

Fix this by decreasing the USB 3.x allocation to 900 Mb/s which then allows
both tunnels to get the maximum HBR2 bandwidth.  This way, the reserved
bandwidth for USB 3.x and PCIe, would be 1350 Mb/s (taking weights of USB 3.x
and PCIe into account). So bandwidth allocations on a link are:
USB 3.x + PCIe tunnels => 1350 Mb/s
DisplayPort tunnel #1  => 17280 Mb/s
DisplayPort tunnel #2  => 17280 Mb/s

Total consumed bandwidth is 35910 Mb/s. So that all the above can be tunneled
on a Gen 3 link (which allows maximum of 36000 Mb/s).
