Subject: [PATCH] mmc: cqhci: Provide helper for resetting both SDHCI and CQHCI
Git-commit: ebb5fd38f41132e6924cb33b647337f4a5d5360c
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc5
References: git-fixes

Several SDHCI drivers need to deactivate command queueing in their reset
hook (see sdhci_cqhci_reset() / sdhci-pci-core.c, for example), and
several more are coming.

Those reset implementations have some small subtleties (e.g., ordering
of initialization of SDHCI vs. CQHCI might leave us resetting with a
NULL ->cqe_private), and are often identical across different host
drivers.

We also don't want to force a dependency between SDHCI and CQHCI, or
vice versa; non-SDHCI drivers use CQHCI, and SDHCI drivers might support
command queueing through some other means.

So, implement a small helper, to avoid repeating the same mistakes in
different drivers. Simply stick it in a header, because it's so small it
doesn't deserve its own module right now, and inlining to each driver is
pretty reasonable.

This is marked for -stable, as it is an important prerequisite patch for
several SDHCI controller bugfixes that follow.
