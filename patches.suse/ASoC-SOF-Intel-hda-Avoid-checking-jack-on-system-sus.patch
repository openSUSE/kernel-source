System takes a very long time to suspend after commit 215a22ed31a1
("alsa: hda: Refactor codec PM to use direct-complete optimization"):

That commit keeps the codec suspended during the system suspend. However,
mute/micmute LED will clear codec's direct-complete flag by
dpm_clear_superiors_direct_complete().

This doesn't play well with SOF driver. When its runtime resume is
called for system suspend, hda_codec_jack_check() schedules
jackpoll_work which uses snd_hdac_is_power_on() to check whether codec
is suspended. Because the direct-complete path isn't taken,
pm_runtime_disable() isn't called so snd_hdac_is_power_on() returns
false and jackpoll continues to run, and snd_hda_power_up_pm() cannot
power up an already suspended codec in multiple attempts, causes the
long delay on system suspend:

if (dev->power.direct_complete) {
	if (pm_runtime_status_suspended(dev)) {
		pm_runtime_disable(dev);
		if (pm_runtime_status_suspended(dev)) {
			pm_dev_dbg(dev, state, "direct-complete ");
			goto Complete;
		}

		pm_runtime_enable(dev);
	}
	dev->power.direct_complete = false;
}

When direct-complete path is taken, snd_hdac_is_power_on() returns true
and hda_jackpoll_work() is skipped by accident. So this is still not
correct.

If we were to use snd_hdac_is_power_on() in system PM path,
pm_runtime_status_suspended() should be used instead of
pm_runtime_suspended(), otherwise pm_runtime_{enable,disable}() may
change the outcome of snd_hdac_is_power_on().

Because devices suspend in reverse order (i.e. child first), it doesn't
make much sense to resume an already suspended codec from audio
controller. So avoid the issue by making sure jackpoll isn't used in
system PM process.
