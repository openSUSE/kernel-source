There's an issue with deferred requests through drain, where if we do
need to defer, we're not copying over the sqe_submit state correctly.
This can result in using uninitialized data when we then later go and
submit the deferred request, like this check in __io_submit_sqe():

         if (unlikely(s->index >= ctx->sq_entries))
                 return -EINVAL;

with 's' being uninitialized, we can randomly fail this check. Fix this
by copying sqe_submit state when we defer a request.

Because it was fixed as part of a cleanup series in mainline, before
anyone realized we had this issue. That removed the separate states
of ->index vs ->submit.sqe. That series is not something I was
comfortable putting into stable, hence the much simpler addition.
Here's the patch in the series that fixes the same issue:
