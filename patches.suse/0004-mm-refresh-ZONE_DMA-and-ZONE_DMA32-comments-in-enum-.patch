Subject: mm: refresh ZONE_DMA and ZONE_DMA32 comments in 'enum zone_type'
Git-commit: 734f9246e791d8da278957b2c326d7709b2a97c0
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-7772

These zones usage has evolved with time and the comments were outdated.
This joins both ZONE_DMA and ZONE_DMA32 explanation and gives up to date
examples on how they are used on different architectures.

-	 * ZONE_DMA is used when there are devices that are not able

-	 * carve out the portion of memory that is needed for these devices.
-	 * The range is arch specific.
+	 * ZONE_DMA and ZONE_DMA32 are used when there are peripherals not able
+	 * to DMA to all of the addressable memory (ZONE_NORMAL).
+	 * On architectures where this area covers the whole 32 bit address
+	 * space ZONE_DMA32 is used. ZONE_DMA is left for the ones with smaller
+	 * DMA addressing constraints. This distinction is important as a 32bit
+	 * DMA mask is assumed when ZONE_DMA32 is defined. Some 64-bit
+	 * platforms may need both zones as they support peripherals with
+	 * different DMA addressing limitations.
+	 *
+	 * Some examples:
+	 *
+	 *  - i386 and x86_64 have a fixed 16M ZONE_DMA and ZONE_DMA32 for the
+	 *    rest of the lower 4G.
+	 *
+	 *  - arm only uses ZONE_DMA, the size, up to 4G, may vary depending on
+	 *    the specific device.
+	 *
+	 *  - arm64 has a fixed 1G ZONE_DMA and ZONE_DMA32 for the rest of the
+	 *    lower 4G.
 	 *
-	 * Some examples
+	 *  - powerpc only uses ZONE_DMA, the size, up to 2G, may vary
+	 *    depending on the specific device.
