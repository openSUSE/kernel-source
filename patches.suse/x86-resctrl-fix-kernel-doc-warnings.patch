Subject: x86/resctrl: Fix kernel-doc warnings
Git-commit: 025d5ac978cc3b47874cc1c03ab096a78b49f278
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc6
References: git-fixes

The kernel test robot reported kernel-doc warnings here:

  monitor.c:34: warning: Cannot understand  * @rmid_free_lru    A least recently used list of free RMIDs on line 34 - I thought it was a doc line
  monitor.c:41: warning: Cannot understand  * @rmid_limbo_count     count of currently unused but (potentially) on line 41 - I thought it was a doc line
  monitor.c:50: warning: Cannot understand  * @rmid_entry - The entry in the limbo and free lists.  on line 50 - I thought it was a doc line

We don't have a syntax for documenting individual data items via
kernel-doc, so remove the "/**" kernel-doc markers and add a hyphen
for consistency.

Fixes: 6a445edce657 ("x86/intel_rdt/cqm: Add RDT monitoring initialization")
Fixes: 24247aeeabe9 ("x86/intel_rdt/cqm: Improve limbo list processing")
