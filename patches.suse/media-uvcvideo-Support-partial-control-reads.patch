Subject: [PATCH] media: uvcvideo: Support partial control reads
Git-commit: f00ee2ca8da25ebccb8e19956d853c9055e2c8d0
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc1
References: git-fixes

Some cameras, like the ELMO MX-P3, do not return all the bytes
requested from a control if it can fit in less bytes.
Eg: Returning 0xab instead of 0x00ab.
usb 3-9: Failed to query (GET_DEF) UVC control 3 on unit 2: 1 (exp. 2).

Extend the returned value from the camera and return it.
