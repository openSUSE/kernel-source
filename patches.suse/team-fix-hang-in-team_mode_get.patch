Subject: team: fix hang in team_mode_get()
Git-commit: 1c30fbc76b8f0c07c92a8ca4cd7c456612e17eb5
Patch-mainline: 5.7-rc3
References: networking-stable-20_04_27

When team mode is changed or set, the team_mode_get() is called to check
whether the mode module is inserted or not. If the mode module is not
inserted, it calls the request_module().
In the request_module(), it creates a child process, which is
the "modprobe" process and waits for the done of the child process.
At this point, the following locks were used.
down_read(&cb_lock()); by genl_rcv()
    genl_lock(); by genl_rcv_msc()
        rtnl_lock(); by team_nl_cmd_options_set()
            mutex_lock(&team->lock); by team_nl_team_get()

Concurrently, the team module could be removed by rmmod or "modprobe -r"
The __exit function of team module is team_module_exit(), which calls
team_nl_fini() and it tries to acquire following locks.
down_write(&cb_lock);
    genl_lock();
Because of the genl_lock() and cb_lock, this process can't be finished
earlier than request_module() routine.

The problem secenario.
CPU0                                     CPU1
team_mode_get
    request_module()
                                         modprobe -r team_mode_roundrobin
                                                     team <--(B)
        modprobe team <--(A)
            team_mode_roundrobin

By request_module(), the "modprobe team_mode_roundrobin" command
will be executed. At this point, the modprobe process will decide
that the team module should be inserted before team_mode_roundrobin.
Because the team module is being removed.

By the module infrastructure, the same module insert/remove operations
can't be executed concurrently.
So, (A) waits for (B) but (B) also waits for (A) because of locks.
So that the hang occurs at this point.

Test commands:
    while :
    do
        teamd -d &
	killall teamd &
	modprobe -rv team_mode_roundrobin &
    done

The approach of this patch is to hold the reference count of the team
module if the team module is compiled as a module. If the reference count
of the team module is not zero while request_module() is being called,
the team module will not be removed at that moment.
So that the above scenario could not occur.
