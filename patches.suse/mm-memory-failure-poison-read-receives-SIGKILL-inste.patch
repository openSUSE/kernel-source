Subject: mm/memory-failure: poison read receives SIGKILL instead of SIGBUS if
 mmaped more than once
Git-commit: 3d7fed4ad8ccb691d217efbb0f934e6a4df5ef91
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc4
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.8

Mmap /dev/dax more than once, then read the poison location using
address from one of the mappings.  The other mappings due to not having
the page mapped in will cause SIGKILLs delivered to the process.
SIGKILL succeeds over SIGBUS, so user process loses the opportunity to
handle the UE.

Although one may add MAP_POPULATE to mmap(2) to work around the issue,
MAP_POPULATE makes mapping 128GB of pmem several magnitudes slower, so
isn't always an option.

Details -

  ndctl inject-error --block=10 --count=1 namespace6.0

  ./read_poison -x dax6.0 -o 5120 -m 2
  mmaped address 0x7f5bb6600000
