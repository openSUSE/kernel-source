Subject: [PATCH] driver: core: Fix list corruption after device_del()
Git-commit: 66482f640755b31cb94371ff6cef17400cda6db5
Patch-mainline: v5.11-rc1
References: git-fixes

The device_links_purge() function (called from device_del()) tries to
remove the links.needs_suppliers list entry, but it's using
list_del(), hence it doesn't initialize after the removal.  This is OK
for normal cases where device_del() is called via device_destroy().
However, it's not guaranteed that the device object will be really
deleted soon after device_del().  In a minor case like HD-audio codec
reconfiguration that re-initializes the device after device_del(), it
may lead to a crash by the corrupted list entry.

As a simple fix, replace list_del() with list_del_init() in order to
make the list intact after the device_del() call.
