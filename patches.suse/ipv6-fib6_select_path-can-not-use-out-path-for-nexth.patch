Subject: ipv6: fib6_select_path can not use out path for nexthop objects
Git-commit: 34fe5a1cf95c3f114068fc16d919c9cf4b00e428
Patch-mainline: 5.8-rc5
References: networking-stable-20_07_17

Brian reported a crash in IPv6 code when using rpfilter with a setup
running FRR and external nexthop objects. The root cause of the crash
is fib6_select_path setting fib6_nh in the result to NULL because of
an improper check for nexthop objects.

More specifically, rpfilter invokes ip6_route_lookup with flowi6_oif
set causing fib6_select_path to be called with have_oif_match set.
fib6_select_path has early check on have_oif_match and jumps to the
out label which presumes a builtin fib6_nh. This path is invalid for
nexthop objects; for external nexthops fib6_select_path needs to just
return if the fib6_nh has already been set in the result otherwise it
returns after the call to nexthop_path_fib6_result. Update the check
on have_oif_match to not bail on external nexthops.

Update selftests for this problem.

Fixes: f88d8ea67fbd ("ipv6: Plumb support for nexthop object in a fib6_info")
