Subject: drm/vmwgfx: Disable damage clipping if FB changed since last
 page-flip
Git-commit: b83b2a80d662cc8ba9d78db64fb70fbb5a481d9c
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: drm-backport-placeholder

The driver does per-buffer uploads and needs to force a full plane update
if the plane's attached framebuffer has change since the last page-flip.
