Subject: [PATCH] io_uring: tighten task exit cancellations
Git-commit: f8b632e89a101dae349a7b212c1771d7925f441b
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
References: git-fixes

io_uring_cancel_generic() should retry if any state changes like a
request is completed, however in case of a task exit it only goes for
another loop and avoids schedule() if any tracked (i.e. REQ_F_INFLIGHT)
request got completed.

Let's assume we have a non-tracked request executing in iowq and a
tracked request linked to it. Let's also assume
io_uring_cancel_generic() fails to find and cancel the request, i.e.
via io_run_local_work(), which may happen as io-wq has gaps.
Next, the request logically completes, io-wq still hold a ref but queues
it for completion via tw, which happens in
io_uring_try_cancel_requests(). After, right before prepare_to_wait()
io-wq puts the request, grabs the linked one and tries executes it, e.g.
arms polling. Finally the cancellation loop calls prepare_to_wait(),
there are no tw to run, no tracked request was completed, so the
tctx_inflight() check passes and the task is put to indefinite sleep.
