Subject: r8152: Re-order napi_disable in rtl8152_close
Patch-mainline: v5.4
Git-commit: 84811412464d66fcf73661a279aa1d7985166495
References: bsc#1159949

Both rtl_work_func_t() and rtl8152_close() call napi_disable().
Since the two calls aren't protected by a lock, if the close
function starts executing before the work function, we can get into a
situation where the napi_disable() function is called twice in
succession (first by rtl8152_close(), then by set_carrier()).

In such a situation, the second call would loop indefinitely, since
rtl8152_close() doesn't call napi_enable() to clear the NAPI_STATE_SCHED
bit.

The rtl8152_close() function in turn issues a
cancel_delayed_work_sync(), and so it would wait indefinitely for the
rtl_work_func_t() to complete. Since rtl8152_close() is called by a
process holding rtnl_lock() which is requested by other processes, this
eventually leads to a system deadlock and crash.

Re-order the napi_disable() call to occur after the work function
disabling and urb cancellation calls are issued.
