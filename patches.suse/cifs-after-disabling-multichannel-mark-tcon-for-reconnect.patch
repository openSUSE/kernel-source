Subject: [PATCH] cifs: after disabling multichannel, mark tcon for reconnect
Git-commit: 27e1fd343f80168ff456785c2443136b6b7ca3cc
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc8

Once the server disables multichannel for an active multichannel
session, on the following reconnect, the client would reduce
the number of channels to 1. However, it could be the case that
the tree connect was active on one of these disabled channels.
This results in an unrecoverable state.

This change fixes that by making sure that whenever a channel
is being terminated, the session and tcon are marked for
reconnect too. This could mean a few redundant tree connect
calls to the server, but considering that this is not a frequent
event, we should be okay.

Fixes: ee1d21794e55 ("cifs: handle when server stops supporting multichannel")
