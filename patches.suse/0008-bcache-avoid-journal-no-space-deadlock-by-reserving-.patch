Subject: [PATCH] bcache: avoid journal no-space deadlock by reserving 1
 journal bucket
Git-commit: 32feee36c30ea06e38ccb8ae6e5c44c6eec790a6
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: git-fixes CVE-2022-49327 bsc#1238662

The journal no-space deadlock was reported time to time. Such deadlock
can happen in the following situation.

When all journal buckets are fully filled by active jset with heavy
write I/O load, the cache set registration (after a reboot) will load
all active jsets and inserting them into the btree again (which is
called journal replay). If a journaled bkey is inserted into a btree
node and results btree node split, new journal request might be
triggered. For example, the btree grows one more level after the node
split, then the root node record in cache device super block will be
upgrade by bch_journal_meta() from bch_btree_set_root(). But there is no
space in journal buckets, the journal replay has to wait for new journal
bucket to be reclaimed after at least one journal bucket replayed. This
is one example that how the journal no-space deadlock happens.

The solution to avoid the deadlock is to reserve 1 journal bucket in
run time, and only permit the reserved journal bucket to be used during
cache set registration procedure for things like journal replay. Then
the journal space will never be fully filled, there is no chance for
journal no-space deadlock to happen anymore.

This patch adds a new member "bool do_reserve" in struct journal, it is
inititalized to 0 (false) when struct journal is allocated, and set to
1 (true) by bch_journal_space_reserve() when all initialization done in
run_cache_set(). In the run time when journal_reclaim() tries to
allocate a new journal bucket, free_journal_buckets() is called to check
whether there are enough free journal buckets to use. If there is only
1 free journal bucket and journal->do_reserve is 1 (true), the last
bucket is reserved and free_journal_buckets() will return 0 to indicate
no free journal bucket. Then journal_reclaim() will give up, and try
next time to see whetheer there is free journal bucket to allocate. By
this method, there is always 1 jouranl bucket reserved in run time.

During the cache set registration, journal->do_reserve is 0 (false), so
the reserved journal bucket can be used to avoid the no-space deadlock.
