Subject: [PATCH] spi: stm32: Rate-limit the 'Communication suspended' message
Git-commit: ea8be08cc9358f811e4175ba7fa7fea23c5d393e
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc5
References: git-fixes

The 'spi_stm32 44004000.spi: Communication suspended' message means that
when using PIO, the kernel did not read the FIFO fast enough and so the
SPI controller paused the transfer. Currently, this is printed on every
single such event, so if the kernel is busy and the controller is pausing
the transfers often, the kernel will be all the more busy scrolling this
message into the log buffer every few milliseconds. That is not helpful.

Instead, rate-limit the message and print it every once in a while. It is
not possible to use the default dev_warn_ratelimited(), because that is
still too verbose, as it prints 10 lines (DEFAULT_RATELIMIT_BURST) every
5 seconds (DEFAULT_RATELIMIT_INTERVAL). The policy here is to print 1 line
every 50 seconds (DEFAULT_RATELIMIT_INTERVAL * 10), because 1 line is more
than enough and the cycles saved on printing are better left to the CPU to
handle the SPI. However, dev_warn_once() is also not useful, as the user
should be aware that this condition is possibly recurring or ongoing. Thus
the custom rate-limit policy.

Finally, turn the message from dev_warn() to dev_dbg(), since the system
does not suffer any sort of malfunction if this message appears, it is
just slowing down. This further reduces the printing into the log buffer
and frees the CPU to do useful work.
