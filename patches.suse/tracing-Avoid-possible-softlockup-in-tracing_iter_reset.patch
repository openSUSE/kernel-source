Subject: tracing: Avoid possible softlockup in tracing_iter_reset()
Git-commit: 49aa8a1f4d6800721c7971ed383078257f12e8f9
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc7
References: git-fixes

In __tracing_open(), when max latency tracers took place on the cpu,
the time start of its buffer would be updated, then event entries with
timestamps being earlier than start of the buffer would be skipped
(see tracing_iter_reset()).

Softlockup will occur if the kernel is non-preemptible and too many
entries were skipped in the loop that reset every cpu buffer, so add
cond_resched() to avoid it.
