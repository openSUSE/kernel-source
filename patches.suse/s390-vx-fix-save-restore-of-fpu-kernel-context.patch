Subject: s390/vx: fix save/restore of fpu kernel context
Git-commit: e6b2dab41888332bf83f592131e7ea07756770a4
Patch-mainline: v6.7 or v6.7-rc7 (next release)
References: git-fixes bsc#1218359

The KERNEL_FPR mask only contains a flag for the first eight vector
registers. However floating point registers overlay parts of the first
sixteen vector registers.

This could lead to vector register corruption if a kernel fpu context uses
any of the vector registers 8 to 15 and is interrupted or calls a
KERNEL_FPR context. If that context uses also vector registers 8 to 15,
their contents will be corrupted on return.

Luckily this is currently not a real bug, since the kernel has only one
KERNEL_FPR user with s390_adjust_jiffies() and it is only using floating
point registers 0 to 2.

Fix this by using the correct bits for KERNEL_FPR.
