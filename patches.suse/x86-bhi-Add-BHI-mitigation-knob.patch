Subject: x86/bhi: Add BHI mitigation knob
Patch-mainline: Not yet, embargoed patch
References: bsc#1217339 CVE-2024-2201

Branch history clearing software sequences and hardware control
BHI_DIS_S were defined to mitigate Branch History Injection (BHI).

Add cmdline spectre_bhi={on|off|auto} to control BHI mitigation:

 auto - Deploy the hardware mitigation BHI_DIS_S, if available.
 on   - Deploy the hardware mitigation BHI_DIS_S, if available,
        otherwise deploy the software sequence at syscall entry and
	VMexit.
 off  - Turn off BHI mitigation.

The default is auto mode which does not deploy software sequence
mitigation. This default is chosen due high complexity of BHI attack and
other requirements such as local execution and deep system knowledge.
Users that don't run untrusted software shouldn't have to incur the
performance loss. For whom security is more important than the
performance may choose to use spectre_bhi=on. When available, hardware
mitigation is deployed by default because it is a lot cheaper than the
software sequence mitigation.
