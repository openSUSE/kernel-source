Subject: [PATCH] ibmvnic: don't stop queue in xmit

References: bsc#1192273 ltc#194629
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
Git-commit: 8878e46fcfd46b19964bd90e13b25dd94cbfc9be

If adapter's resetting bit is on, discard the packet but don't stop the
transmit queue - instead leave that to the reset code. With this change,
it is possible that we may get several calls to ibmvnic_xmit() that simply
discard packets and return.

But if we stop the queue here, we might end up doing so just after
__ibmvnic_open() started the queues (during a hard/soft reset) and before
the ->resetting bit was cleared. If that happens, there will be no one to
restart queue and transmissions will be blocked indefinitely.

This can cause a TIMEOUT reset and with auto priority failover enabled,
an unnecessary FAILOVER reset to less favored backing device and then a
FAILOVER back to the most favored backing device. If we hit the window
repeatedly, we can get stuck in a loop of TIMEOUT, FAILOVER, FAILOVER
resets leaving the adapter unusable for extended periods of time.
