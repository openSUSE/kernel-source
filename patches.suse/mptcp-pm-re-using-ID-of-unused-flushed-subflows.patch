Subject: [PATCH 1/1] mptcp: pm: re-using ID of unused flushed subflows
Git-commit: ef34a6ea0cab1800f4b3c9c3c2cefd5091e03379
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc5
References: git-fixes

If no subflows are attached to the 'subflow' endpoints that are being
flushed, the corresponding addr IDs will not be marked as available
again.

Mark all ID as being available when flushing all the 'subflow'
endpoints, and reset local_addr_used counter to cover these cases.

Note that mptcp_pm_remove_addrs_and_subflows() helper is only called for
flushing operations, not to remove a specific set of addresses and
subflows.
