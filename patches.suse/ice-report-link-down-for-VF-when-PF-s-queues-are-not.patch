Subject: ice: report link down for VF when PF's queues are not enabled
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
Git-commit: c61d2342349fe01687db70bcbec91766596daef4
References: jsc#SLE-7926

This is port of a fix from i40e commit 2ad1274fa35a ("i40e: don't
report link up for a VF who hasn't enabled queues")

Older VF drivers do not respond well to receiving a link
up notification before queues are enabled. This can cause their state
machine to think that it is safe to send traffic. This results in a Tx
hang on the VF.

Record whether the PF has actually enabled queues for the VF. When
reporting link status, always report link down if the queues aren't
enabled. In this way, the VF driver will never receive a link up
notification until after its queues are enabled.
