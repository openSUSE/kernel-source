Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: seq: oss: Serialize ioctls
Git-commit: 80982c7e834e5d4e325b6ce33757012ecafdf0bb
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc1
References: git-fixes

Some ioctls via OSS sequencer API may race and lead to UAF when the
port create and delete are performed concurrently, as spotted by a
couple of syzkaller cases.  This patch is an attempt to address it by
serializing the ioctls with the existing register_mutex.

Basically OSS sequencer API is an obsoleted interface and was designed
without much consideration of the concurrency.  There are very few
applications with it, and the concurrent performance isn't asked,
hence this "big hammer" approach should be good enough.
