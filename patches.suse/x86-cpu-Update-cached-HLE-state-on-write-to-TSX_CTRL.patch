Subject: x86/cpu: Update cached HLE state on write to TSX_CTRL_CPUID_CLEAR
Git-commit: 5efc6fa9044c3356d6046c6e1da6d02572dbed6b
Patch-mainline: 5.6-rc1
References: git-fixes

/proc/cpuinfo currently reports Hardware Lock Elision (HLE) feature to
be present on boot cpu even if it was disabled during the bootup. This
is because cpuinfo_x86->x86_capability HLE bit is not updated after TSX
state is changed via the new MSR IA32_TSX_CTRL.

Update the cached HLE bit also since it is expected to change after an
update to CPUID_CLEAR bit in MSR IA32_TSX_CTRL.

Fixes: 95c5824f75f3 ("x86/cpu: Add a "tsx=" cmdline option with TSX disabled by default")
