Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/hdmi: always check pin power status in i915 pin fixup
Git-commit: 858e0ad9301d1270c02b5aca97537d2d6ee9dd68
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc4
References: jsc#SLE-16518

When system is suspended with active audio playback to HDMI/DP, two
alternative sequences can happen at resume:
  a) monitor is detected first and ALSA prepare follows normal
     stream setup sequence, or
  b) ALSA prepare is called first, but monitor is not yet detected,
     so PCM is restarted without a pin,

In case of (b), on i915 systems, haswell_verify_D0() is not called at
resume and the pin power state may be incorrect. Result is lack of audio
after resume with no error reported back to user-space.

Fix the problem by always verifying converter and pin state in the
i915_pin_cvt_fixup().
