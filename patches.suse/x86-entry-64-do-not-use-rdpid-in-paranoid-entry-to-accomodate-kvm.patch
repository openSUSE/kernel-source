Subject: x86/entry/64: Do not use RDPID in paranoid entry to accomodate KVM
Git-commit: 6a3ea3e68b8a8a26c4aaac03432ed92269c9a14e
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc2
References: jsc#SLE-14846

KVM has an optmization to avoid expensive MRS read/writes on
VMENTER/EXIT. It caches the MSR values and restores them either when
leaving the run loop, on preemption or when going out to user space.

The affected MSRs are not required for kernel context operations. This
changed with the recently introduced mechanism to handle FSGSBASE in the
paranoid entry code which has to retrieve the kernel GSBASE value by
accessing per CPU memory. The mechanism needs to retrieve the CPU number
and uses either LSL or RDPID if the processor supports it.

Unfortunately RDPID uses MSR_TSC_AUX which is in the list of cached and
lazily restored MSRs, which means between the point where the guest value
is written and the point of restore, MSR_TSC_AUX contains a random number.

If an NMI or any other exception which uses the paranoid entry path happens
in such a context, then RDPID returns the random guest MSR_TSC_AUX value.

As a consequence this reads from the wrong memory location to retrieve the
kernel GSBASE value. Kernel GS is used to for all regular this_cpu_*()
operations. If the GSBASE in the exception handler points to the per CPU
memory of a different CPU then this has the obvious consequences of data
corruption and crashes.

As the paranoid entry path is the only place which accesses MSR_TSX_AUX
(via RDPID) and the fallback via LSL is not significantly slower, remove
the RDPID alternative from the entry path and always use LSL.

The alternative would be to write MSR_TSC_AUX on every VMENTER and VMEXIT
which would be inflicting massive overhead on that code path.
