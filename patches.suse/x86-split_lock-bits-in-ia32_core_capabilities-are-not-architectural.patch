Subject: x86/split_lock: Bits in IA32_CORE_CAPABILITIES are not architectural
Git-commit: 48fd5b5ee714714f4cf9f9e1cba3b49b1fd40ed6
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc2
References: jsc#SLE-12677

The Intel Software Developers' Manual erroneously listed bit 5 of the
IA32_CORE_CAPABILITIES register as an architectural feature. It is not.

Features enumerated by IA32_CORE_CAPABILITIES are model specific and
implementation details may vary in different cpu models. Thus it is only
safe to trust features after checking the CPU model.

Icelake client and server models are known to implement the split lock
detect feature even though they don't enumerate IA32_CORE_CAPABILITIES
