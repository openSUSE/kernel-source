Subject: [PATCH] sched: Add test_and_clear_wake_up_bit() and
 atomic_dec_and_wake_up()
Git-commit: 52d633def56c10fe3e82a2c5d88c3ecb3f4e4852
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
References: git-fixes

There are common patterns in the kernel of using test_and_clear_bit()
before wake_up_bit(), and atomic_dec_and_test() before wake_up_var().

These combinations don't need extra barriers but sometimes include them
unnecessarily.

To help avoid the unnecessary barriers and to help discourage the
general use of wake_up_bit/var (which is a fragile interface) introduce
two combined functions which implement these patterns.

Also add store_release_wake_up() which supports the task of simply
setting a non-atomic variable and sending a wakeup.  This pattern
requires barriers which are often omitted.
