Subject: selftests: hugetlb_dio: fixup check for initial conditions to skip in
 the start
Git-commit: fae1980347bfd23325099b69db6638b94149a94c
Patch-mainline: v6.12
References: git-fixes

This test verifies that a hugepage, used as a user buffer for DIO
operations, is correctly freed upon unmapping.  To test this, we read the
count of free hugepages before and after the mmap, DIO, and munmap
operations, then check if the free hugepage count is the same.

Reading free hugepages before the test was removed by commit 0268d4579901
('selftests: hugetlb_dio: check for initial conditions to skip at the
start'), causing the test to always fail.

This patch adds back reading the free hugepages before starting the test.
With this patch, the tests are now passing.
