Subject: sched/rt: Provide migrate_disable/enable() inlines
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
Git-commit: 66630058e56b26b3a9cf2625e250a8c592dd0207
References: bsc#1162702

Code which solely needs to prevent migration of a task uses
preempt_disable()/enable() pairs. This is the only reliable way to do so
as setting the task affinity to a single CPU can be undone by a
setaffinity operation from a different task/process.

RT provides a seperate migrate_disable/enable() mechanism which does not
disable preemption to achieve the semantic requirements of a (almost) fully
preemptible kernel.

As it is unclear from looking at a given code path whether the intention is
to disable preemption or migration, introduce migrate_disable/enable()
inline functions which can be used to annotate code which merely needs to
disable migration. Map them to preempt_disable/enable() for now. The RT
substitution will be provided later.

Code which is annotated that way documents that it has no requirement to
protect against reentrancy of a preempting task. Either this is not
required at all or the call sites are already serialized by other means.
