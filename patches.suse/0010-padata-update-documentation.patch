+=======================================
+The padata parallel execution mechanism
+=======================================
+
+:Date: December 2019
+
+Padata is a mechanism by which the kernel can farm jobs out to be done in
+parallel on multiple CPUs while retaining their ordering.  It was developed for
+use with the IPsec code, which needs to be able to perform encryption and
+decryption on large numbers of packets without reordering those packets.  The
+crypto developers made a point of writing padata in a sufficiently general
+fashion that it could be put to other uses as well.
+
+Usage
+=====
+
+Initializing
+------------
+
+The first step in using padata is to set up a padata_instance structure for
+overall control of how jobs are to be run::
+
+    #include <linux/padata.h>
+
+    struct padata_instance *padata_alloc_possible(const char *name);
+
+'name' simply identifies the instance.
+
+There are functions for enabling and disabling the instance::
+
+    int padata_start(struct padata_instance *pinst);
+    void padata_stop(struct padata_instance *pinst);
+
+These functions are setting or clearing the "PADATA_INIT" flag; if that flag is
+not set, other functions will refuse to work.  padata_start() returns zero on
+success (flag set) or -EINVAL if the padata cpumask contains no active CPU
+(flag not set).  padata_stop() clears the flag and blocks until the padata
+instance is unused.
+
+Finally, complete padata initialization by allocating a padata_shell::
+
+   struct padata_shell *padata_alloc_shell(struct padata_instance *pinst);
+
+A padata_shell is used to submit a job to padata and allows a series of such
+jobs to be serialized independently.  A padata_instance may have one or more
+padata_shells associated with it, each allowing a separate series of jobs.
+
+Modifying cpumasks
+------------------
+
+The CPUs used to run jobs can be changed in two ways, programatically with
+padata_set_cpumask() or via sysfs.  The former is defined::
+
+    int padata_set_cpumask(struct padata_instance *pinst, int cpumask_type,
+			   cpumask_var_t cpumask);
+
+Here cpumask_type is one of PADATA_CPU_PARALLEL or PADATA_CPU_SERIAL, where a
+parallel cpumask describes which processors will be used to execute jobs
+submitted to this instance in parallel and a serial cpumask defines which
+processors are allowed to be used as the serialization callback processor.
+cpumask specifies the new cpumask to use.
+
+There may be sysfs files for an instance's cpumasks.  For example, pcrypt's
+live in /sys/kernel/pcrypt/<instance-name>.  Within an instance's directory
+there are two files, parallel_cpumask and serial_cpumask, and either cpumask
+may be changed by echoing a bitmask into the file, for example::
+
+    echo f > /sys/kernel/pcrypt/pencrypt/parallel_cpumask
+
+Reading one of these files shows the user-supplied cpumask, which may be
+different from the 'usable' cpumask.
+
+Padata maintains two pairs of cpumasks internally, the user-supplied cpumasks
+and the 'usable' cpumasks.  (Each pair consists of a parallel and a serial
+cpumask.)  The user-supplied cpumasks default to all possible CPUs on instance
+allocation and may be changed as above.  The usable cpumasks are always a
+subset of the user-supplied cpumasks and contain only the online CPUs in the
+user-supplied masks; these are the cpumasks padata actually uses.  So it is
+legal to supply a cpumask to padata that contains offline CPUs.  Once an
+offline CPU in the user-supplied cpumask comes online, padata is going to use
+it.
+
+Changing the CPU masks are expensive operations, so it should not be done with
+great frequency.
+
+Running A Job
+-------------
+
+Actually submitting work to the padata instance requires the creation of a
+padata_priv structure, which represents one job::
+
+    struct padata_priv {
+        /* Other stuff here... */
+	void                    (*parallel)(struct padata_priv *padata);
+	void                    (*serial)(struct padata_priv *padata);
+    };
+
+This structure will almost certainly be embedded within some larger
+structure specific to the work to be done.  Most of its fields are private to
+padata, but the structure should be zeroed at initialisation time, and the
+parallel() and serial() functions should be provided.  Those functions will
+be called in the process of getting the work done as we will see
+momentarily.
+
+The submission of the job is done with::
+
+    int padata_do_parallel(struct padata_shell *ps,
+		           struct padata_priv *padata, int *cb_cpu);
+
+The ps and padata structures must be set up as described above; cb_cpu
+points to the preferred CPU to be used for the final callback when the job is
+done; it must be in the current instance's CPU mask (if not the cb_cpu pointer
+is updated to point to the CPU actually chosen).  The return value from
+padata_do_parallel() is zero on success, indicating that the job is in
+progress. -EBUSY means that somebody, somewhere else is messing with the
+instance's CPU mask, while -EINVAL is a complaint about cb_cpu not being in the
+serial cpumask, no online CPUs in the parallel or serial cpumasks, or a stopped
+instance.
+
+Each job submitted to padata_do_parallel() will, in turn, be passed to
+exactly one call to the above-mentioned parallel() function, on one CPU, so
+true parallelism is achieved by submitting multiple jobs.  parallel() runs with
+software interrupts disabled and thus cannot sleep.  The parallel()
+function gets the padata_priv structure pointer as its lone parameter;
+information about the actual work to be done is probably obtained by using
+container_of() to find the enclosing structure.
+
+Note that parallel() has no return value; the padata subsystem assumes that
+parallel() will take responsibility for the job from this point.  The job
+need not be completed during this call, but, if parallel() leaves work
+outstanding, it should be prepared to be called again with a new job before
+the previous one completes.
+
+Serializing Jobs
+----------------
+
+When a job does complete, parallel() (or whatever function actually finishes
+the work) should inform padata of the fact with a call to::
+
+    void padata_do_serial(struct padata_priv *padata);
+
+At some point in the future, padata_do_serial() will trigger a call to the
+serial() function in the padata_priv structure.  That call will happen on
+the CPU requested in the initial call to padata_do_parallel(); it, too, is
+run with local software interrupts disabled.
+Note that this call may be deferred for a while since the padata code takes
+pains to ensure that jobs are completed in the order in which they were
+submitted.
+
+Destroying
+----------
+
+Cleaning up a padata instance predictably involves calling the three free
+functions that correspond to the allocation in reverse::
+
+    void padata_free_shell(struct padata_shell *ps);
+    void padata_stop(struct padata_instance *pinst);
+    void padata_free(struct padata_instance *pinst);
+
+It is the user's responsibility to ensure all outstanding jobs are complete
+before any of the above are called.

-The padata parallel execution mechanism
-=======================================
-
-:Last updated: for 2.6.36
-
-Padata is a mechanism by which the kernel can farm work out to be done in
-parallel on multiple CPUs while retaining the ordering of tasks.  It was
-developed for use with the IPsec code, which needs to be able to perform
-encryption and decryption on large numbers of packets without reordering
-those packets.  The crypto developers made a point of writing padata in a
-sufficiently general fashion that it could be put to other uses as well.
-
-The first step in using padata is to set up a padata_instance structure for
-overall control of how tasks are to be run::
-
-    #include <linux/padata.h>
-
-    struct padata_instance *padata_alloc(const char *name,
-					 const struct cpumask *pcpumask,
-					 const struct cpumask *cbcpumask);
-
-'name' simply identifies the instance.
-
-The pcpumask describes which processors will be used to execute work
-submitted to this instance in parallel. The cbcpumask defines which
-processors are allowed to be used as the serialization callback processor.
-The workqueue wq is where the work will actually be done; it should be
-a multithreaded queue, naturally.
-
-To allocate a padata instance with the cpu_possible_mask for both
-cpumasks this helper function can be used::
-
-    struct padata_instance *padata_alloc_possible(struct workqueue_struct *wq);
-
-Note: Padata maintains two kinds of cpumasks internally. The user supplied
-cpumasks, submitted by padata_alloc/padata_alloc_possible and the 'usable'
-cpumasks. The usable cpumasks are always a subset of active CPUs in the
-user supplied cpumasks; these are the cpumasks padata actually uses. So
-it is legal to supply a cpumask to padata that contains offline CPUs.
-Once an offline CPU in the user supplied cpumask comes online, padata
-is going to use it.
-
-There are functions for enabling and disabling the instance::
-
-    int padata_start(struct padata_instance *pinst);
-    void padata_stop(struct padata_instance *pinst);
-
-These functions are setting or clearing the "PADATA_INIT" flag;
-if that flag is not set, other functions will refuse to work.
-padata_start returns zero on success (flag set) or -EINVAL if the
-padata cpumask contains no active CPU (flag not set).
-padata_stop clears the flag and blocks until the padata instance
-is unused.
-
-The list of CPUs to be used can be adjusted with these functions::
-
-    int padata_set_cpumasks(struct padata_instance *pinst,
-			    cpumask_var_t pcpumask,
-			    cpumask_var_t cbcpumask);
-    int padata_set_cpumask(struct padata_instance *pinst, int cpumask_type,
-			   cpumask_var_t cpumask);
-    int padata_add_cpu(struct padata_instance *pinst, int cpu, int mask);
-    int padata_remove_cpu(struct padata_instance *pinst, int cpu, int mask);
-
-Changing the CPU masks are expensive operations, though, so it should not be
-done with great frequency.
-
-It's possible to change both cpumasks of a padata instance with
-padata_set_cpumasks by specifying the cpumasks for parallel execution (pcpumask)
-and for the serial callback function (cbcpumask). padata_set_cpumask is used to
-change just one of the cpumasks. Here cpumask_type is one of PADATA_CPU_SERIAL,
-PADATA_CPU_PARALLEL and cpumask specifies the new cpumask to use.
-To simply add or remove one CPU from a certain cpumask the functions
-padata_add_cpu/padata_remove_cpu are used. cpu specifies the CPU to add or
-remove and mask is one of PADATA_CPU_SERIAL, PADATA_CPU_PARALLEL.
-
-If a user is interested in padata cpumask changes, he can register to
-the padata cpumask change notifier::
-
-    int padata_register_cpumask_notifier(struct padata_instance *pinst,
-					 struct notifier_block *nblock);
-
-To unregister from that notifier::
-
-    int padata_unregister_cpumask_notifier(struct padata_instance *pinst,
-					   struct notifier_block *nblock);
-
-The padata cpumask change notifier notifies about changes of the usable
-cpumasks, i.e. the subset of active CPUs in the user supplied cpumask.
-
-Padata calls the notifier chain with::
-
-    blocking_notifier_call_chain(&pinst->cpumask_change_notifier,
-				 notification_mask,
-				 &pd_new->cpumask);
-
-Here cpumask_change_notifier is registered notifier, notification_mask
-is one of PADATA_CPU_SERIAL, PADATA_CPU_PARALLEL and cpumask is a pointer
-to a struct padata_cpumask that contains the new cpumask information.
-
-Actually submitting work to the padata instance requires the creation of a
-padata_priv structure::
-
-    struct padata_priv {
-        /* Other stuff here... */
-	void                    (*parallel)(struct padata_priv *padata);
-	void                    (*serial)(struct padata_priv *padata);
-    };
-
-This structure will almost certainly be embedded within some larger
-structure specific to the work to be done.  Most of its fields are private to
-padata, but the structure should be zeroed at initialisation time, and the
-parallel() and serial() functions should be provided.  Those functions will
-be called in the process of getting the work done as we will see
-momentarily.
-
-The submission of work is done with::
-
-    int padata_do_parallel(struct padata_instance *pinst,
-		           struct padata_priv *padata, int cb_cpu);
-
-The pinst and padata structures must be set up as described above; cb_cpu
-specifies which CPU will be used for the final callback when the work is
-done; it must be in the current instance's CPU mask.  The return value from
-padata_do_parallel() is zero on success, indicating that the work is in
-progress. -EBUSY means that somebody, somewhere else is messing with the
-instance's CPU mask, while -EINVAL is a complaint about cb_cpu not being
-in that CPU mask or about a not running instance.
-
-Each task submitted to padata_do_parallel() will, in turn, be passed to
-exactly one call to the above-mentioned parallel() function, on one CPU, so
-true parallelism is achieved by submitting multiple tasks.  parallel() runs with
-software interrupts disabled and thus cannot sleep.  The parallel()
-function gets the padata_priv structure pointer as its lone parameter;
-information about the actual work to be done is probably obtained by using
-container_of() to find the enclosing structure.

-need not be completed during this call, but, if parallel() leaves work

-whatever function actually finishes the job) should inform padata of the

-serial() function in the padata_priv structure.  That call will happen on
-the CPU requested in the initial call to padata_do_parallel(); it, too, is
-run with local software interrupts disabled.
-Note that this call may be deferred for a while since the padata code takes
-pains to ensure that tasks are completed in the order in which they were
-submitted.
-
-The one remaining function in the padata API should be called to clean up
-when a padata instance is no longer needed::
-
-    void padata_free(struct padata_instance *pinst);
-
-This function will busy-wait while any remaining tasks are completed, so it
-might be best not to call it while there is work outstanding.
