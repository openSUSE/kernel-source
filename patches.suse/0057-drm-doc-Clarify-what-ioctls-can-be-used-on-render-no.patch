Subject: drm/doc: Clarify what ioctls can be used on render nodes
Git-commit: aa457ff1b2be72c0d89ee2118769859e513e6fc8
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

The documentation for render nodes indicates that only "PRIME-related"
ioctls are valid on render nodes, but the documentation does not clarify
what that means.  If the reader is not familiar with PRIME, they may
beleive this to be only the ioctls with "PRIME" in the name and not other
ioctls such as set of syncobj ioctls.  Clarify the situation for the
reader by referencing where the reader will find a current list of valid
ioctls.

 If a driver advertises render node support, DRM core will create a

 guess the flink names or mmap offsets on the legacy interface.
 Additionally to this basic interface, drivers must mark their
