Subject: [PATCH] Revert "Bluetooth: hci_qca: Set BDA quirk bit if fwnode exists in DT"
Git-commit: 4790a73ace86f3d165bbedba898e0758e6e1b82d
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc3
References: jsc#PED-10412

This reverts commit 7dcd3e014aa7faeeaf4047190b22d8a19a0db696.

Qualcomm Bluetooth controllers like WCN6855 do not have persistent
storage for the Bluetooth address and must therefore start as
unconfigured to allow the user to set a valid address unless one has
been provided by the boot firmware in the devicetree.

A recent change snuck into v6.8-rc7 and incorrectly started marking the
default (non-unique) address as valid. This specifically also breaks the
Bluetooth setup for some user of the Lenovo ThinkPad X13s.

Note that this is the second time Qualcomm breaks the driver this way
and that this was fixed last year by commit 6945795bc81a ("Bluetooth:
fix use-bdaddr-property quirk"), which also has some further details.
