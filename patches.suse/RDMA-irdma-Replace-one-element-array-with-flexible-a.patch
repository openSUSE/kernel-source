Subject: [PATCH 1/1] RDMA/irdma: Replace one-element array with flexible-array
 member
Git-commit: 38313c6d2a02c28162e06753b01bd885caf9386d
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc1
References: git-fixes

One-element and zero-length arrays are deprecated. So, replace
one-element array in struct irdma_qvlist_info with flexible-array
member.

A patch for this was sent a while ago[1]. However, it seems that, at
the time, the changes were partially folded[2][3], and the actual
flexible-array transformation was omitted. This patch fixes that.

The only binary difference seen before/after changes is shown below:

|+     562:      add    $0x4,%rdi

which is, of course, expected as it reflects the mistake made
while folding the patch I've mentioned above.

Worth mentioning is the fact that with this change we save 12 bytes
of memory, as can be inferred from the diff snapshot above. Notice
that:

$ pahole -C rdma_qv_info idrivers/infiniband/hw/irdma/hw.o
struct irdma_qv_info {
	u32                        v_idx;                /*     0     4 */
	u16                        ceq_idx;              /*     4     2 */
	u16                        aeq_idx;              /*     6     2 */
	u8                         itr_idx;              /*     8     1 */

	/* size: 12, cachelines: 1, members: 4 */
	/* padding: 3 */
	/* last cacheline: 12 bytes */
};
