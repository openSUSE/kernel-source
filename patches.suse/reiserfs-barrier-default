+	  Modern disk drives support write caches that can speed up writeback.
+	  Some devices, in order to improve their performance statistics,
+	  report that the write has been completed even when it has only
+	  been committed to volatile cache memory. This can result in
+	  severe corruption in the event of power loss.
+
+	  The -o barrier option enables the file system to direct the block
+	  layer to issue a barrier, which ensures that the cache has been
+	  flushed before proceeding. This can produce some slowdown in
+	  certain environments, but allows higher end storage arrays with
+	  battery-backed caches to report completes writes sooner than
+	  would be otherwise possible.
+
+	  Without this option, disk write caches should be disabled if
+	  you value data integrity over writeback performance.
+
+	  If unsure, say N.
