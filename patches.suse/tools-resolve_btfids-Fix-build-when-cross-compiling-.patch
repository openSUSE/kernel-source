Subject: tools/resolve_btfids: Fix build when cross compiling kernel with
 clang.
Patch-mainline: v6.16-rc2
Git-commit: a298bbab903e3fb4cbe16d36d6195e68fad1b776
References: git-fixes

When cross compiling the kernel with clang, we need to override
CLANG_CROSS_FLAGS when preparing the step libraries.

Prior to commit d1d096312176 ("tools: fix annoying "mkdir -p ..." logs
when building tools in parallel"), MAKEFLAGS would have been set to a
value that wouldn't set a value for CLANG_CROSS_FLAGS, hiding the
fact that we weren't properly overriding it.
