Subject: x86/resctrl: Fix incorrect local bandwidth when mba_sc is enabled
Git-commit: 06c5fe9b12dde1b62821f302f177c972bb1c81f9
Patch-mainline: v5.10
References: bsc#1152489

The MBA software controller (mba_sc) is a feedback loop which
periodically reads MBM counters and tries to restrict the bandwidth
below a user-specified value. It tags along the MBM counter overflow
handler to do the updates with 1s interval in mbm_update() and
update_mba_bw().

The purpose of mbm_update() is to periodically read the MBM counters to
make sure that the hardware counter doesn't wrap around more than once
between user samplings. mbm_update() calls __mon_event_count() for local
bandwidth updating when mba_sc is not enabled, but calls mbm_bw_count()
instead when mba_sc is enabled. __mon_event_count() will not be called
for local bandwidth updating in MBM counter overflow handler, but it is
still called when reading MBM local bandwidth counter file
'mbm_local_bytes', the call path is as below:

  rdtgroup_mondata_show()
    mon_event_read()
      mon_event_count()
        __mon_event_count()

In __mon_event_count(), m->chunks is updated by delta chunks which is
calculated from previous MSR value (m->prev_msr) and current MSR value.
When mba_sc is enabled, m->chunks is also updated in mbm_update() by
mistake by the delta chunks which is calculated from m->prev_bw_msr
instead of m->prev_msr. But m->chunks is not used in update_mba_bw() in
the mba_sc feedback loop.

When reading MBM local bandwidth counter file, m->chunks was changed
unexpectedly by mbm_bw_count(). As a result, the incorrect local
bandwidth counter which calculated from incorrect m->chunks is shown to
the user.

Fix this by removing incorrect m->chunks updating in mbm_bw_count() in
MBM counter overflow handler, and always calling __mon_event_count() in
mbm_update() to make sure that the hardware local bandwidth counter
doesn't wrap around.

Test steps:
  # Run workload with aggressive memory bandwidth (e.g., 10 GB/s)
  git clone https://github.com/intel/intel-cmt-cat && cd intel-cmt-cat
  && make
  ./tools/membw/membw -c 0 -b 10000 --read

  # Enable MBA software controller
  mount -t resctrl resctrl -o mba_MBps /sys/fs/resctrl

  # Create control group c1
  mkdir /sys/fs/resctrl/c1

  # Set MB throttle to 6 GB/s
  echo "MB:0=6000;1=6000" > /sys/fs/resctrl/c1/schemata

  # Write PID of the workload to tasks file
  echo `pidof membw` > /sys/fs/resctrl/c1/tasks

  # Read local bytes counters twice with 1s interval, the calculated
  # local bandwidth is not as expected (approaching to 6 GB/s):
  local_1=`cat /sys/fs/resctrl/c1/mon_data/mon_L3_00/mbm_local_bytes`
  sleep 1
  local_2=`cat /sys/fs/resctrl/c1/mon_data/mon_L3_00/mbm_local_bytes`
  echo "local b/w (bytes/s):" `expr $local_2 - $local_1`

Before fix:
  local b/w (bytes/s): 11076796416

After fix:
  local b/w (bytes/s): 5465014272
