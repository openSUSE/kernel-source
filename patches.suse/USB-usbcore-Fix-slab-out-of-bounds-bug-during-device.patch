Subject: USB: usbcore: Fix slab-out-of-bounds bug during device reset
Git-commit: 3dd550a2d36596a1b0ee7955da3b611c031d3873
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.1

The syzbot fuzzer provoked a slab-out-of-bounds error in the USB core:

The error occurs when the descriptors_changed() routine (called during
a device reset) attempts to compare the old and new BOS and capability
descriptors.  The length it uses for the comparison is the
wTotalLength value stored in BOS descriptor, but this value is not
necessarily the same as the length actually allocated for the
descriptors.  If it is larger the routine will call memcmp() with a
length that is too big, thus reading beyond the end of the allocated
region and leading to this fault.

The kernel reads the BOS descriptor twice: first to get the total
length of all the capability descriptors, and second to read it along
with all those other descriptors.  A malicious (or very faulty) device
may send different values for the BOS descriptor fields each time.
The memory area will be allocated using the wTotalLength value read
the first time, but stored within it will be the value read the second
time.

To prevent this possibility from causing any errors, this patch
modifies the BOS descriptor after it has been read the second time:
It sets the wTotalLength field to the actual length of the descriptors
that were read in and validated.  Then the memcpy() call, or any other
code using these descriptors, will be able to rely on wTotalLength
being valid.
