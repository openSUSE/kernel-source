Subject: [PATCH 4/4] btrfs: don't clear qgroup reserved bit in release_folio
Git-commit: a86805504b88f636a6458520d85afdf0634e3c6b
Patch-mainline: v6.7
References: bsc#1216196

The EXTENT_QGROUP_RESERVED bit is used to "lock" regions of the file for
duplicate reservations. That is two writes to that range in one
transaction shouldn't create two reservations, as the reservation will
only be freed once when the write finally goes down. Therefore, it is
never OK to clear that bit without freeing the associated qgroup
reserve. At this point, we don't want to be freeing the reserve, so mask
off the bit.
