Subject: drm/i915/gt: Temporarily disable CPU caching into DMA for MTL
Git-commit: 34df0a031d8f3488fe72627b041a1f82437fa6ec
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: drm-backport-placeholder

FIXME: It is suspected that some Address Translation Service (ATS)
issue on IOMMU is causing CAT errors to occur on some MTL workloads.
Applying a write barrier to the ppgtt set entry functions appeared
to have no effect, so we must temporarily use I915_MAP_WC in the
map_pt_dma class of functions on MTL until a proper ATS solution is
found.
