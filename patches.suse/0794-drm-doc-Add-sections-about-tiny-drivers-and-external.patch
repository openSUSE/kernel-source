Subject: drm/doc: Add sections about tiny drivers and external refs to intro
 page
Git-commit: e41a2999f746e67f1230dd42930497d4e011eb9a
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

Learning about the DRM subsystem could be quite overwhelming for newcomers
but there are lots of useful talks, slides and articles available that can
help to understand the needed concepts and ease the learning curve.

There are also simple DRM drivers that can be used as example about how a
DRM driver should look like.

Add sections to the introduction page, that contains references to these.

+Simple DRM drivers to use as examples
+=====================================
+
+The DRM subsystem contains a lot of helper functions to ease writing drivers for
+simple graphic devices. For example, the `drivers/gpu/drm/tiny/` directory has a
+set of drivers that are simple enough to be implemented in a single source file.
+
+These drivers make use of the `struct drm_simple_display_pipe_funcs`, that hides
+any complexity of the DRM subsystem and just requires drivers to implement a few
+functions needed to operate the device. This could be used for devices that just
+need a display pipeline with one full-screen scanout buffer feeding one output.
+
+The tiny DRM drivers are good examples to understand how DRM drivers should look
+like. Since are just a few hundreds lines of code, they are quite easy to read.
+
+External References
+===================
+
+Delving into a Linux kernel subsystem for the first time can be an overwhelming
+experience, one needs to get familiar with all the concepts and learn about the
+subsystem's internals, among other details.
+
+To shallow the learning curve, this section contains a list of presentations
+and documents that can be used to learn about DRM/KMS and graphics in general.
+
+There are different reasons why someone might want to get into DRM: porting an
+existing fbdev driver, write a DRM driver for a new hardware, fixing bugs that
+could face when working on the graphics user-space stack, etc. For this reason,
+the learning material covers many aspects of the Linux graphics stack. From an
+overview of the kernel and user-space stacks to very specific topics.
+
+The list is sorted in reverse chronological order, to keep the most up-to-date
+material at the top. But all of them contain useful information, and it can be
+valuable to go through older material to understand the rationale and context
+in which the changes to the DRM subsystem were made.
