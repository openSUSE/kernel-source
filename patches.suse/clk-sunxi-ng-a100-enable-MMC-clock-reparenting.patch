Subject: [PATCH] clk: sunxi-ng: a100: enable MMC clock reparenting
Git-commit: 16414720045de30945b8d14b7907e0cbf81a4b49
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc1
References: git-fixes

While testing the MMC nodes proposed in [1], it was noted that mmc0/1
would fail to initialize, with "mmc: fatal err update clk timeout" in
the kernel logs. A closer look at the clock definitions showed that the MMC
MPs had the "CLK_SET_RATE_NO_REPARENT" flag set. No reason was given for
adding this flag in the first place, and its original purpose is unknown,
but it doesn't seem to make sense and results in severe limitations to MMC
speeds. Thus, remove this flag from the 3 MMC MPs.
