Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/64s/exception: Add more comments for interrupt
 handlers

References: jsc#SLE-9246
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
Git-commit: 94325357e8c064e28930a9f571395ca9782a6e6d

A few of the non-standard handlers are left uncommented. Some more
description could be added to some.

+ * Interrupt 0x100 - System Reset Interrupt (SRESET aka NMI).
+ * This is a non-maskable, asynchronous interrupt always taken in real-mode.
+ * It is caused by:
+ * - Wake from power-saving state, on powernv.
+ * - An NMI from another CPU, triggered by firmware or hypercall.
+ * - As crash/debug signal injected from BMC, firmware or hypervisor.
+ *
+ * Handling:
+ * Power-save wakeup is the only performance critical path, so this is
+ * determined quickly as possible first. In this case volatile registers
+ * can be discarded and SPRs like CFAR don't need to be read.
+ *
+ * If not a powersave wakeup, then it's run as a regular interrupt, however
+ * it uses its own stack and PACA save area to preserve the regular kernel
+ * environment for debugging.
+ *
+ * This interrupt is not maskable, so triggering it when MSR[RI] is clear,
+ * or SCRATCH0 is in use, etc. may cause a crash. It's also not entirely
+ * correct to switch to virtual mode to run the regular interrupt handler
+ * because it might be interrupted when the MMU is in a bad state (e.g., SLB
+ * is clear).
+ *
+ * FWNMI:
+ * PAPR specifies a "fwnmi" facility which sends the sreset to a different
+ * entry point with a different register set up. Some hypervisors will
+ * send the sreset to 0x100 in the guest if it is not fwnmi capable.
+ *
+ * KVM:
+ * Unlike most SRR interrupts, this may be taken by the host while executing
+ * in a guest, so a KVM test is required. KVM will pull the CPU out of guest
+ * mode and then raise the sreset.

+ * Interrupt 0x200 - Machine Check Interrupt (MCE).
+ * This is a non-maskable interrupt always taken in real-mode. It can be

+ * taken in a power-saving state.
+ *
+ * Handling:
+ * Similarly to system reset, this uses its own stack and PACA save area,
+ * the difference is re-entrancy is allowed on the machine check stack.
+ *
+ * machine_check_early is run in real mode, and carefully decodes the
+ * machine check and tries to handle it (e.g., flush the SLB if there was an
+ * error detected there), determines if it was recoverable and logs the
+ * event.
+ *
+ * Then, depending on the execution context when the interrupt is taken, there
+ * are 3 main actions:
+ * - Executing in kernel mode. The event is queued with irq_work, which means
+ *   it is handled when it is next safe to do so (i.e., the kernel has enabled
+ *   interrupts), which could be immediately when the interrupt returns. This
+ *   avoids nasty issues like switching to virtual mode when the MMU is in a
+ *   bad state, or when executing OPAL code. (SRESET is exposed to such issues,
+ *   but it has different priorities). Check to see if the CPU was in power
+ *   save, and return via the wake up code if it was.
+ *
+ * - Executing in user mode. machine_check_exception is run like a normal
+ *   interrupt handler, which processes the data generated by the early handler.
+ *
+ * - Executing in guest mode. The interrupt is run with its KVM test, and
+ *   branches to KVM to deal with. KVM may queue the event for the host
+ *   to report later.
+ *
+ * This interrupt is not maskable, so if it triggers when MSR[RI] is clear,
