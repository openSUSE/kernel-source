Subject: [PATCH] locking/rwsem: No need to check for handoff bit if wait queue
 empty
Git-commit: f9e21aa9e6fb11355e54c8949a390d49ca21cde1
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: bsc#1204996

Since commit d257cc8cb8d5 ("locking/rwsem: Make handoff bit handling
more consistent"), the handoff bit is always cleared if the wait queue
becomes empty. There is no need to check for RWSEM_FLAG_HANDOFF when
the wait list is known to be empty.
