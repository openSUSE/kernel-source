Subject: [PATCH] nfc: nci: free rx_data_reassembly skb on NCI device cleanup
Git-commit: bfb007aebe6bff451f7f3a4be19f4f286d0d5d9c
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc3
References: git-fixes

rx_data_reassembly skb is stored during NCI data exchange for processing
fragmented packets. It is dropped only when the last fragment is processed
or when an NTF packet with NCI_OP_RF_DEACTIVATE_NTF opcode is received.
However, the NCI device may be deallocated before that which leads to skb
leak.

As by design the rx_data_reassembly skb is bound to the NCI device and
nothing prevents the device to be freed before the skb is processed in
some way and cleaned, free it on the NCI device cleanup.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.
