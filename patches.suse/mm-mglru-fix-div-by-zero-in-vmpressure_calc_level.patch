Subject: mm/mglru: fix div-by-zero in vmpressure_calc_level()
Git-commit: 8b671fe1a879923ecfb72dda6caf01460dd885ef
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
References: CVE-2024-42316 bsc#1229353

evict_folios() uses a second pass to reclaim folios that have gone through
page writeback and become clean before it finishes the first pass, since
folio_rotate_reclaimable() cannot handle those folios due to the
isolation.

The second pass tries to avoid potential double counting by deducting
scan_control->nr_scanned.  However, this can result in underflow of
nr_scanned, under a condition where shrink_folio_list() does not increment
nr_scanned, i.e., when folio_trylock() fails.

The underflow can cause the divisor, i.e., scale=scanned+reclaimed in
vmpressure_calc_level(), to become zero, resulting in the following crash:

  [exception RIP: vmpressure_work_fn+101]
  process_one_work at ffffffffa3313f2b

Since scan_control->nr_scanned has no established semantics, the potential
double counting has minimal risks.  Therefore, fix the problem by not
deducting scan_control->nr_scanned in evict_folios().
