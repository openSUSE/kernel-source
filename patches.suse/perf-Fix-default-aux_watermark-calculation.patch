Subject: perf: Fix default aux_watermark calculation
Git-commit: 43deb76b19663a96ec2189d8f4eb9a9dc2d7623f
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
References: git-fixes

The default aux_watermark is half the AUX area buffer size. In general,
on a 64-bit architecture, the AUX area buffer size could be a bigger than
fits in a 32-bit type, but the calculation does not allow for that
possibility.

However the aux_watermark value is recorded in a u32, so should not be
more than U32_MAX either.

Fix by doing the calculation in a correctly sized type, and limiting the
result to U32_MAX.
