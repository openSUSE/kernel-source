Subject: [PATCH 8/9] net: octeon: mgmt: Repair filling of RX ring
Git-commit: 0c34bb598c510e070160029f34efeeb217000f8d
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
References: git-fixes

The removal of mips_swiotlb_ops exposed a problem in octeon_mgmt Ethernet
driver. mips_swiotlb_ops had an mb() after most of the operations and the
removal of the ops had broken the receive functionality of the driver.
My code inspection has shown no other places except
octeon_mgmt_rx_fill_ring() where an explicit barrier would be obviously
missing. The latter function however has to make sure that "ringing the
bell" doesn't happen before RX ring entry is really written.

The patch has been successfully tested on Octeon II.
