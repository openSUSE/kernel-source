Subject: scsi: lpfc: size cpu map by last cpu id set
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
Git-commit: eede4970fb6c29f2056d7d016a3764c90e9d8a65
References: bsc#1157160

Currently the lpfc driver sizes its cpu_map array based on
num_possible_cpus(). However, that can be a value that is less than the
highest cpu id bit that is set. As such, if a thread runs on a cpu with a
larger cpu id, or for_each_possible_cpu() is used, the driver could index
off the end of the array and return garbage or GPF.

The driver maintains its own internal copy of the "num_possible" cpu value
and sizes arrays by it.

Fix by setting the driver's value to the value of the last cpu id bit set
in the possible_mask - plus 1. Thus cpu_map will be sized to allow access
by any cpu id possible.
