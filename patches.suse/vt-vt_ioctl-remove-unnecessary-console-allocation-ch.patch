Subject: [PATCH] vt: vt_ioctl: remove unnecessary console allocation checks
Git-commit: 1aa6e058dd6cd04471b1f21298270014daf48ac9
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: git-fixes

The vc_cons_allocated() checks in vt_ioctl() and vt_compat_ioctl() are
unnecessary because they can only be reached by calling ioctl() on an
open tty, which implies the corresponding virtual console is allocated.

And even if the virtual console *could* be freed concurrently, then
these checks would be broken since they aren't done under console_lock,
and the vc_data is dereferenced before them anyway.

So, remove these unneeded checks to avoid confusion.
