Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86/mmu: Skip the "try unsync" path iff the old SPTE was
 a leaf SPTE
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Apply make_spte()'s optimization to skip trying to unsync shadow pages if
and only if the old SPTE was a leaf SPTE, as non-leaf SPTEs in direct MMUs
are always writable, i.e. could trigger a false positive and incorrectly
lead to KVM creating a SPTE without write-protecting or marking shadow
pages unsync.

This bug only affects the TDP MMU, as the shadow MMU only overwrites a
shadow-present SPTE when synchronizing SPTEs (and only 4KiB SPTEs can be
unsync).  Specifically, mmu_set_spte() drops any non-leaf SPTEs *before*
calling make_spte(), whereas the TDP MMU can do a direct replacement of a
page table with the leaf SPTE.

Opportunistically update the comment to explain why skipping the unsync
stuff is safe, as opposed to simply saying "it's someone else's problem".
