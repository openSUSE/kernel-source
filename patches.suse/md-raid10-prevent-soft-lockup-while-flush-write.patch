Subject: [PATCH] md/raid10: prevent soft lockup while flush writes
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.4.7
Git-commit: 010444623e7f4da6b4a4dd603a7da7469981e293

[ Upstream commit 010444623e7f4da6b4a4dd603a7da7469981e293 ]

Currently, there is no limit for raid1/raid10 plugged bio. While flushing
writes, raid1 has cond_resched() while raid10 doesn't, and too many
writes can cause soft lockup.

Follow up soft lockup can be triggered easily with writeback test for
raid10 with ramdisks:

watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#10 stuck for 27s! [md0_raid10:1293]

Fix the problem by adding cond_resched() to raid10 like what raid1 did.

Note that unlimited plugged bio still need to be optimized, for example,
in the case of lots of dirty pages writeback, this will take lots of
memory and io will spend a long time in plug, hence io latency is bad.
