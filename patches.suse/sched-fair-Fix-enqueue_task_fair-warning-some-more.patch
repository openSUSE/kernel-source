Subject: [PATCH] sched/fair: Fix enqueue_task_fair() warning some more

References: bnc#1155798 (CPU scheduler functional and performance backports)

sched/fair: Fix enqueue_task_fair warning some more

The recent patch, fe61468b2cb (sched/fair: Fix enqueue_task_fair warning)
did not fully resolve the issues with the rq->tmp_alone_branch !=
&rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list warning in enqueue_task_fair. There is a case where
the first for_each_sched_entity loop exits due to on_rq, having incompletely
updated the list.  In this case the second for_each_sched_entity loop can
further modify se. The later code to fix up the list management fails to do
what is needed because se does not point to the sched_entity which broke out
of the first loop. The list is not fixed up because the throttled parent was
already added back to the list by a task enqueue in a parallel child hierarchy.

Address this by calling list_add_leaf_cfs_rq if there are throttled parents
while doing the second for_each_sched_entity loop.
