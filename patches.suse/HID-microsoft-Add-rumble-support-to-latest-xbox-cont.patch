Subject: HID: microsoft: Add rumble support to latest xbox controllers
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc1
Git-commit: f5554725f30475b05b5178b998366f11ecb50c7f
References: bsc#1211280

Currently, rumble is only supported via bluetooth on a single xbox
controller, called 'model 1708'. On the back of the device, it's named
'wireless controller for xbox one'. However, in 2021, Microsoft released
a firmware update for this controller. As part of this update, the HID
descriptor of the device changed. The product ID was also changed from
0x02fd to 0x0b20. On this controller, rumble was supported via
hid-microsoft, which matched against the old product id (0x02fd). As a
result, the firmware update broke rumble support on this controller.

See:
https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/09/08/xbox-controller-firmware-update-rolling-out-to-insiders-starting-today/

The hid-microsoft driver actually supports rumble on the new firmware,
as well. So simply adding new product id is sufficient to bring back
this support.

After discussing further with the xbox team, it was pointed out that
another xbox controller, xbox elite series 2, can be supported in a
similar way.

Add rumble support for all of these devices in this patch. Two of the
devices have received firmware updates that caused their product id's to
change. Both old and new firmware versions of these devices were tested.

The tested controllers are:

1. 'wireless controller for xbox one', model 1708
2. 'xbox wireless controller', model 1914. This is also sometimes
   referred to as 'xbox series S|X'.
3. 'elite series 2', model 1797.

The tested configurations are:
1. model 1708, pid 0x02fd (old firmware)
2. model 1708, pid 0x0b20 (new firmware)
3. model 1914, pid 0x0b13
4. model 1797, pid 0x0b05 (old firmware)
5. model 1797, pid 0x0b22 (new firmware)

I verified rumble support on both bluetooth and usb.
