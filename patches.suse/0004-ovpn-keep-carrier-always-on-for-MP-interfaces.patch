Subject: ovpn: keep carrier always on for MP interfaces
References: bsc#1239783
Git-commit: 8327a3baa9b0561a410d00b209aae621b5a61b1c
Patch-mainline: 6.16-rc1

An ovpn interface configured in MP mode will keep carrier always
on and let the user decide when to bring it administratively up and
down.

This way a MP node (i.e. a server) will keep its interface always
up and running, even when no peer is connected.
