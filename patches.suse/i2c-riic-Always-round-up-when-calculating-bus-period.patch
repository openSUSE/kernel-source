Subject: [PATCH] i2c: riic: Always round-up when calculating bus period
Git-commit: de6b43798d9043a7c749a0428dbb02d5fff156e5
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc3
References: git-fixes

Currently, the RIIC driver may run the I2C bus faster than requested,
which may cause subtle failures.  E.g. Biju reported a measured bus
speed of 450 kHz instead of the expected maximum of 400 kHz on RZ/G2L.

The initial calculation of the bus period uses DIV_ROUND_UP(), to make
sure the actual bus speed never becomes faster than the requested bus
speed.  However, the subsequent division-by-two steps do not use
round-up, which may lead to a too-small period, hence a too-fast and
possible out-of-spec bus speed.  E.g. on RZ/Five, requesting a bus speed
of 100 resp. 400 kHz will yield too-fast target bus speeds of 100806
resp. 403226 Hz instead of 97656 resp. 390625 Hz.

Fix this by using DIV_ROUND_UP() in the subsequent divisions, too.

Tested on RZ/A1H, RZ/A2M, and RZ/Five.
