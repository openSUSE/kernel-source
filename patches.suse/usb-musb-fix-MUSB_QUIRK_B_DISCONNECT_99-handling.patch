Subject: [PATCH] usb: musb: fix MUSB_QUIRK_B_DISCONNECT_99 handling
Git-commit: b65ba0c362be665192381cc59e3ac3ef6f0dd1e1
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc6
References: git-fixes

In commit 92af4fc6ec33 ("usb: musb: Fix suspend with devices
connected for a64"), the logic to support the
MUSB_QUIRK_B_DISCONNECT_99 quirk was modified to only conditionally
schedule the musb->irq_work delayed work.

This commit badly breaks ECM Gadget on AM335X. Indeed, with this
commit, one can observe massive packet loss:

$ ping 192.168.0.100
...
15 packets transmitted, 3 received, 80% packet loss, time 14316ms

Reverting this commit brings back a properly functioning ECM
Gadget. An analysis of the commit seems to indicate that a mistake was
Made: the previous code was not falling through into the
MUSB_QUIRK_B_INVALID_VBUS_91, but now it is, unless the condition is
taken.

Changing the logic to be as it was before the problematic commit *and*
only conditionally scheduling musb->irq_work resolves the regression:

$ ping 192.168.0.100
...
64 packets transmitted, 64 received, 0% packet loss, time 64475ms
