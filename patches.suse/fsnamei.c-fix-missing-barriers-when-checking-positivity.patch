Subject: [PATCH] fs/namei.c: fix missing barriers when checking positivity 
Git-commit: 2fa6b1e01a9b1a54769c394f06cd72c3d12a2d48
References: bsc#1159271
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1

Pinned negative dentries can, generally, be made positive
by another thread.  Conditions that prevent that are
	* ->d_lock on dentry in question
	* parent directory held at least shared
	* nobody else could have observed the address of dentry
Most of the places working with those fall into one of those
categories; however, d_lookup() and friends need to be used
with some care.  Fortunately, there's not a lot of call sites,
and with few exceptions all of those fall under one of the
cases above.

Exceptions are all in fs/namei.c - in lookup_fast(), lookup_dcache()
and mountpoint_last().  Another one is lookup_slow() - there
dcache lookup is done with parent held shared, but the result
is used after we'd drop the lock.  The same happens in do_last() -
the lookup (in lookup_one()) is done with parent locked, but
result is used after unlocking.

lookup_fast(), do_last() and mountpoint_last() flat-out reject
negatives.

Most of lookup_dcache() calls are made with parent locked at least
shared; the only exception is lookup_one_len_unlocked().  It might
return pinned negative, needs serious care from callers.  Fortunately,
almost nobody calls it directly anymore; all but two callers have
converted to lookup_positive_unlocked(), which rejects negatives.

lookup_slow() is called by the same lookup_one_len_unlocked() (see
above), mountpoint_last() and walk_component().  In those two negatives
are rejected.

In other words, there is a small set of places where we need to
check carefully if a pinned potentially negative dentry is, in
fact, positive.  After that check we want to be sure that both
->d_inode and type bits in ->d_flags are stable and observed.
The set consists of follow_managed() (where the rejection happens
for lookup_fast(), walk_component() and do_last()), last_mountpoint()
and lookup_positive_unlocked().

Solution:
	1) transition from negative to positive (in __d_set_inode_and_type())
stores ->d_inode, then uses smp_store_release() to set ->d_flags type bits.
	2) aforementioned 3 places in fs/namei.c fetch ->d_flags with
smp_load_acquire() and bugger off if it type bits say "negative".
That way anyone downstream of those checks has dentry know positive pinned,
with ->d_inode and type bits of ->d_flags stable and observed.

I considered splitting off d_lookup_positive(), so that the checks could
be done right there, under ->d_lock.  However, that leads to massive
duplication of rather subtle code in fs/namei.c and fs/dcache.c.  It's
worse than it might seem, thanks to autofs ->d_manage() getting involved ;-/
No matter what, autofs_d_manage()/autofs_d_automount() must live with
the possibility of pinned negative dentry passed their way, becoming
positive under them - that's the intended behaviour when lookup comes
in the middle of automount in progress, so we can't keep them out of
the area that has to deal with those, more's the pity...
