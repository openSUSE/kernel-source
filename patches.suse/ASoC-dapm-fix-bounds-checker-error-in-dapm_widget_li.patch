Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: dapm: fix bounds checker error in dapm_widget_list_create
Git-commit: 2ef9439f7a19fd3d43b288d38b1c6e55b668a4fe
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc6
References: git-fixes

The widgets array in the snd_soc_dapm_widget_list has a __counted_by
attribute attached to it, which points to the num_widgets variable. This
attribute is used in bounds checking, and if it is not set before the
array is filled, then the bounds sanitizer will issue a warning or a
kernel panic if CONFIG_UBSAN_TRAP is set.

This patch sets the size of the widgets list calculated with
list_for_each as the initial value for num_widgets as it is used for
allocating memory for the array. It is updated with the actual number of
added elements after the array is filled.
