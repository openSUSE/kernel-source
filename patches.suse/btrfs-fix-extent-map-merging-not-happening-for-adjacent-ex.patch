Subject: btrfs: fix extent map merging not happening for adjacent extents
Git-commit: a0f0625390858321525c2a8d04e174a546bd19b3
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc6
References: bsc#1237232

If we have 3 or more adjacent extents in a file, that is, consecutive file
extent items pointing to adjacent extents, within a contiguous file range
and compatible flags, we end up not merging all the extents into a single
extent map.

For example:

  $ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdc
  $ mount /dev/sdc /mnt/sdc

  $ xfs_io -f -d -c "pwrite -b 64K 0 64K" \
                 -c "pwrite -b 64K 64K 64K" \
                 -c "pwrite -b 64K 128K 64K" \
                 -c "pwrite -b 64K 192K 64K" \
                 /mnt/sdc/foo

After all the ordered extents complete we unpin the extent maps and try
to merge them, but instead of getting a single extent map we get two
because:

1) When the first ordered extent completes (file range [0, 64K)) we
   unpin its extent map and attempt to merge it with the extent map for
   the range [64K, 128K), but we can't because that extent map is still
   pinned;

2) When the second ordered extent completes (file range [64K, 128K)), we
   unpin its extent map and merge it with the previous extent map, for
   file range [0, 64K), but we can't merge with the next extent map, for
   the file range [128K, 192K), because this one is still pinned.

   The merged extent map for the file range [0, 128K) gets the flag
   EXTENT_MAP_MERGED set;

3) When the third ordered extent completes (file range [128K, 192K)), we
   unpin its extent map and attempt to merge it with the previous extent
   map, for file range [0, 128K), but we can't because that extent map
   has the flag EXTENT_MAP_MERGED set (mergeable_maps() returns false
   due to different flags) while the extent map for the range [128K, 192K)
   doesn't have that flag set.

   We also can't merge it with the next extent map, for file range
   [192K, 256K), because that one is still pinned.

   At this moment we have 3 extent maps:

   One for file range [0, 128K), with the flag EXTENT_MAP_MERGED set.
   One for file range [128K, 192K).
   One for file range [192K, 256K) which is still pinned;

4) When the fourth and final extent completes (file range [192K, 256K)),
   we unpin its extent map and attempt to merge it with the previous
   extent map, for file range [128K, 192K), which succeeds since none
   of these extent maps have the EXTENT_MAP_MERGED flag set.

   So we end up with 2 extent maps:

   One for file range [0, 128K), with the flag EXTENT_MAP_MERGED set.
   One for file range [128K, 256K), with the flag EXTENT_MAP_MERGED set.

   Since after merging extent maps we don't attempt to merge again, that
   is, merge the resulting extent map with the one that is now preceding
   it (and the one following it), we end up with those two extent maps,
   when we could have had a single extent map to represent the whole file.

Fix this by making mergeable_maps() ignore the EXTENT_MAP_MERGED flag.
While this doesn't present any functional issue, it prevents the merging
of extent maps which allows to save memory, and can make defrag not
merging extents too (that will be addressed in the next patch).
