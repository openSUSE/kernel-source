Subject: drm/i915/guc: Cancel GuC engine busyness worker synchronously
Git-commit: aee5ae7c8492eaca2be20d202887c9c716ffc86f
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc6
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225 jsc#PED-2849

The worker is canceled in gt_park path, but earlier it was assumed that
gt_park path cannot sleep and the cancel is asynchronous. This caused a
race with suspend flow where the worker runs after suspend and causes an
unclaimed register access warning. Cancel the worker synchronously since
the gt_park is indeed allowed to sleep.
