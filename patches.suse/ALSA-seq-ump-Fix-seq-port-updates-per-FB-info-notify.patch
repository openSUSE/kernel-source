Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: seq: ump: Fix seq port updates per FB info notify
Git-commit: aaa55faa2495320e44bc643a917c701f2cc89ee7
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc2
References: git-fixes

update_port_infos() is called when a UMP FB Info update notification
is received, and this function is supposed to update the attributes of
the corresponding sequencer port.  However, the function had a few
issues and it brought to the incorrect states.  Namely:

- It tried to get a wrong sequencer info for the update without
  correcting the port number with the group-offset 1
- The loop exited immediately when a sequencer port isn't present;
  this ended up with the truncation if a sequencer port in the middle
  goes away

This patch addresses those bugs.
