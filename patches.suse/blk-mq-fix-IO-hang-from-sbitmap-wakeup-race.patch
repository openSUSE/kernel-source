Subject: [PATCH] blk-mq: fix IO hang from sbitmap wakeup race
Git-commit: 5266caaf5660529e3da53004b8b7174cab6374ed
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: bsc#1222357 CVE-2024-26671

In blk_mq_mark_tag_wait(), __add_wait_queue() may be re-ordered
with the following blk_mq_get_driver_tag() in case of getting driver
tag failure.

Then in __sbitmap_queue_wake_up(), waitqueue_active() may not observe
the added waiter in blk_mq_mark_tag_wait() and wake up nothing, meantime
blk_mq_mark_tag_wait() can't get driver tag successfully.

This issue can be reproduced by running the following test in loop, and
fio hang can be observed in < 30min when running it on my test VM
in laptop.

	modprobe -r scsi_debug
	modprobe scsi_debug delay=0 dev_size_mb=4096 max_queue=1 host_max_queue=1 submit_queues=4
	dev=`ls -d /sys/bus/pseudo/drivers/scsi_debug/adapter*/host*/target*/*/block/* | head -1 | xargs basename`
	fio --filename=/dev/"$dev" --direct=1 --rw=randrw --bs=4k --iodepth=1 \
       		--runtime=100 --numjobs=40 --time_based --name=test \
        	--ioengine=libaio

Fix the issue by adding one explicit barrier in blk_mq_mark_tag_wait(), which
is just fine in case of running out of tag.
