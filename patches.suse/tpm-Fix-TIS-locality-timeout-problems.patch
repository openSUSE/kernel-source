Subject: [PATCH] tpm: Fix TIS locality timeout problems
Git-commit: 7862840219058436b80029a0263fd1ef065fb1b3
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc4
References: git-fixes

It has been reported that some TIS based TPMs are giving unexpected
errors when using the O_NONBLOCK path of the TPM device. The problem
is that some TPMs don't like it when you get and then relinquish a
locality (as the tpm_try_get_ops()/tpm_put_ops() pair does) without
sending a command.  This currently happens all the time in the
O_NONBLOCK write path. Fix this by moving the tpm_try_get_ops()
further down the code to after the O_NONBLOCK determination is made.
This is safe because the priv->buffer_mutex still protects the priv
state being modified.
