Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915/gt: Program mocs:63 for cache eviction on gen9
Mime-version: 1.0

Git-commit: 777a7717d60ccdc9b84f35074f848d3f746fc3bf
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc7
No-fix: 977933b5da7c16f39295c4c1d4259a58ece65dbe
References: git-fixes

Ville noticed that the last mocs entry is used unconditionally by the HW
when it performs cache evictions, and noted that while the value is not
meant to be writable by the driver, we should program it to a reasonable
value nevertheless.

As it turns out, we can change the value of mocs:63 and the value we
were programming into it would cause hard hangs in conjunction with
atomic operations.

V2: Add details from bspec about how it is used by HW
