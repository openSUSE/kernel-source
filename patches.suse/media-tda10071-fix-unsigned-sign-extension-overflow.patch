Subject: [PATCH] media: tda10071: fix unsigned sign extension overflow
Git-commit: a7463e2dc698075132de9905b89f495df888bb79
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: git-fixes

The shifting of buf[3] by 24 bits to the left will be promoted to
a 32 bit signed int and then sign-extended to an unsigned long. In
the unlikely event that the the top bit of buf[3] is set then all
then all the upper bits end up as also being set because of
the sign-extension and this affect the ev->post_bit_error sum.
Fix this by using the temporary u32 variable bit_error to avoid
the sign-extension promotion. This also removes the need to do the
computation twice.

Addresses-coverity: ("Unintended sign extension")
