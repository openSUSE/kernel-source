Subject: cgroup/cpuset: Extend kthread_is_per_cpu() check to all
 PF_NO_SETAFFINITY tasks
Git-commit: 39b5ef791d109dd54c7c2e6e87933edfcc0ad1ac
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc7
References: bsc#1241166

Commit ec5fbdfb99d1 ("cgroup/cpuset: Enable update_tasks_cpumask()
on top_cpuset") enabled us to pull CPUs dedicated to child partitions
from tasks in top_cpuset by ignoring per cpu kthreads. However, there
can be other kthreads that are not per cpu but have PF_NO_SETAFFINITY
flag set to indicate that we shouldn't mess with their CPU affinity.
For other kthreads, their affinity will be changed to skip CPUs dedicated
to child partitions whether it is an isolating or a scheduling one.

As all the per cpu kthreads have PF_NO_SETAFFINITY set, the
PF_NO_SETAFFINITY tasks are essentially a superset of per cpu kthreads.
Fix this issue by dropping the kthread_is_per_cpu() check and checking
the PF_NO_SETAFFINITY flag instead.
