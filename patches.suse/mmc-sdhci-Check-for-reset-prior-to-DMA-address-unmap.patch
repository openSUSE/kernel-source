Subject: [PATCH] mmc: sdhci: Check for reset prior to DMA address unmap
Git-commit: 21e35e898aa9ef7781632959db8613a5380f2eae
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc1
References: git-fixes

For data read commands, SDHC may initiate data transfers even before it
completely process the command response. In case command itself fails,
driver un-maps the memory associated with data transfer but this memory
can still be accessed by SDHC for the already initiated data transfer.
This scenario can lead to un-mapped memory access error.

To avoid this scenario, reset SDHC (when command fails) prior to
un-mapping memory. Resetting SDHC ensures that all in-flight data
transfers are either aborted or completed. So we don't run into this
scenario.

Swap the reset, un-map steps sequence in sdhci_request_done().
