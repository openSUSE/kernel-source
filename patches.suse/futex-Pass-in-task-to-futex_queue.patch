Subject: [PATCH] futex: Pass in task to futex_queue()
Git-commit: 5e0e02f0d7e52cfc8b1adfc778dd02181d8b47b4
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc2

futex_queue() -> __futex_queue() uses 'current' as the task to store in
the struct futex_q->task field. This is fine for synchronous usage of
the futex infrastructure, but it's not always correct when used by
io_uring where the task doing the initial futex_queue() might not be
available later on. This doesn't lead to any issues currently, as the
io_uring side doesn't support PI futexes, but it does leave a
potentially dangling pointer which is never a good idea.

Have futex_queue() take a task_struct argument, and have the regular
callers pass in 'current' for that. Meanwhile io_uring can just pass in
NULL, as the task should never be used off that path. In theory
req->tctx->task could be used here, but there's no point populating it
with a task field that will never be used anyway.
