Subject: drm/i915/psr: Fix PSR2 handling of multiplanar format
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: c582ffadbe6cf64be4544d9d168bcc520bd0c984
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

When a plane with a multiplanar format is added to the state by
drm_atomic_add_affected_planes(), only the UV plane is
added, so a intel_atomic_get_new_plane_state() call to get the Y
plane state can return a null pointer.
To fix this, intel_atomic_get_plane_state() should be called and
the return needs to be checked for errors, as it could return a EAGAIN
as other atomic state could be holding the lock for the Y plane.

Other issue with the patch being fixed is that the Y plane is not
being committed to hardware because the corresponded plane bit is not
set in update_planes when UV and Y planes are added to the state by
drm_atomic_add_affected_planes().
