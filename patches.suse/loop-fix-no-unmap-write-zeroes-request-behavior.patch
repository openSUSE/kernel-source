Subject: [PATCH] loop: fix no-unmap write-zeroes request behavior
Git-commit: efcfec579f6139528c9e6925eca2bc4a36da65c6
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: bsc#1158389

Currently, if the loop device receives a WRITE_ZEROES request, it asks
the underlying filesystem to punch out the range.  This behavior is
correct if unmapping is allowed.  However, a NOUNMAP request means that
the caller doesn't want us to free the storage backing the range, so
punching out the range is incorrect behavior.

To satisfy a NOUNMAP | WRITE_ZEROES request, loop should ask the
underlying filesystem to FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE, which is (according to
the fallocate documentation) required to ensure that the entire range is
backed by real storage, which suffices for our purposes.
