Subject: [PATCH] lz4: fix LZ4_decompress_safe_partial read out of bound
Git-commit: eafc0a02391b7b36617b36c97c4b5d6832cf5e24
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc2
References: git-fixes CVE-2022-49078 bsc#1237736

When partialDecoding, it is EOF if we've either filled the output buffer
or can't proceed with reading an offset for following match.

In some extreme corner cases when compressed data is suitably corrupted,
UAF will occur.  As reported by KASAN [1], LZ4_decompress_safe_partial
may lead to read out of bound problem during decoding.  lz4 upstream has
fixed it [2] and this issue has been disscussed here [3] before.

current decompression routine was ported from lz4 v1.8.3, bumping
lib/lz4 to v1.9.+ is certainly a huge work to be done later, so, we'd
better fix it first.
