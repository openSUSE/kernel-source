Subject: [PATCH] io_uring/net: fix multishot accept overflow handling
Git-commit: a37ee9e117ef73bbc2f5c0b31911afd52d229861
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc5
References: git-fixes

If we hit CQ ring overflow when attempting to post a multishot accept
completion, we don't properly save the result or return code. This
results in losing the accepted fd value.

Instead, we return the result from the poll operation that triggered
the accept retry. This is generally POLLIN|POLLPRI|POLLRDNORM|POLLRDBAND
which is 0xc3, or 195, which looks like a valid file descriptor, but it
really has no connection to that.

Handle this like we do for other multishot completions - assign the
result, and return IOU_STOP_MULTISHOT to cancel any further completions
from this request when overflow is hit. This preserves the result, as we
should, and tells the application that the request needs to be re-armed.
