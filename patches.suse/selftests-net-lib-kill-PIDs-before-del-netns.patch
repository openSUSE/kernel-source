Subject: selftests: net: lib: kill PIDs before del netns
Git-commit: 7965a7f32a53d9ad807ce2c53bdda69ba104974f
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc4
References: bsc#1254235

When deleting netns, it is possible to still have some tasks running,
e.g. background tasks like tcpdump running in the background, not
stopped because the test has been interrupted.

Before deleting the netns, it is then safer to kill all attached PIDs,
if any. That should reduce some noises after the end of some tests, and
help with the debugging of some issues. That's why this modification is
seen as a "fix".
