Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: fix regwmask
Git-commit: 0ab070917afdc93670c2d0ea02ab6defb6246a7c
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: git-fixes

If regwshift is 32 and the selected architecture compiles '<<' operator
for signed int literal into rotating shift, '1<<regwshift' became 1 and
it makes regwmask to 0x0.
The literal is set to unsigned long to get intended regwmask.
