Subject: btrfs: Account for trans_block_rsv in may_commit_transaction
Patch-mainline: submitted, 13.03.2020 - https://lore.kernel.org/linux-btrfs/61a9e47f-2580-9595-180b-4adb5e674ff9@suse.com/T/#mb7c117ea2b9277d75495634d63be6ded825b6063
References: bsc#1141456

On ppc64le with 64k page size (respectively 64k block size) generic/320
was failing and debug output showed we were getting a premature ENOSPC
with a bunch of space in btrfs_fs_info::trans_block_rsv.

This meant there were still open transaction handles holding space, yet
the flusher didn't commit the transaction because it deemed the freed
space won't be enough to satisfy the current reserve ticket. Fix this
by accounting for space in trans_block_rsv when deciding whether the
current transaction should be committed or not.
