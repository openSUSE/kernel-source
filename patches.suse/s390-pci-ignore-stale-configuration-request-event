Subject: s390/pci: ignore stale configuration request event
Git-commit: b76fee1bc56c31a9d2a49592810eba30cc06d61a
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc2
References: jsc#SLE-13818 bsc#1177117 LTC#186574

A configuration request event may be stale, that is the event
may reference a zdev which was already configured.
This can happen when a hotplug happens during boot such that
the device is discovered and configured in the initial clp_list_pci(),
then after initialization we enable events and process
the original configuration request which additionally still contains
the old disabled function handle leading to a failure during device
enablement and subsequent I/O lockout.

Fix this by restoring the check that the device to be configured is in
standby which was removed in commit f606b3ef47c9 ("s390/pci: adapt events
for zbus").

This check does not need serialization as we only enable the events after
zPCI has fully initialized, which includes the initial clp_list_pci(),
rescan only does updates and events are serialized with respect to each
other.

Fixes: f606b3ef47c9 ("s390/pci: adapt events for zbus")
