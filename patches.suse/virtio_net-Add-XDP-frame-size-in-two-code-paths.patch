Subject: virtio_net: Add XDP frame size in two code paths
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
Git-commit: 9ce6146ec7b50718fa5ef5287f1d6561b25a5da8
References: bsc#1176447

The virtio_net driver is running inside the guest-OS. There are two
XDP receive code-paths in virtio_net, namely receive_small() and
receive_mergeable(). The receive_big() function does not support XDP.

In receive_small() the frame size is available in buflen. The buffer
backing these frames are allocated in add_recvbuf_small() with same
size, except for the headroom, but tailroom have reserved room for
skb_shared_info. The headroom is encoded in ctx pointer as a value.

In receive_mergeable() the frame size is more dynamic. There are two
basic cases: (1) buffer size is based on a exponentially weighted
moving average (see DECLARE_EWMA) of packet length. Or (2) in case
virtnet_get_headroom() have any headroom then buffer size is
PAGE_SIZE. The ctx pointer is this time used for encoding two values;
the buffer len "truesize" and headroom. In case (1) if the rx buffer
size is underestimated, the packet will have been split over more
buffers (num_buf info in virtio_net_hdr_mrg_rxbuf placed in top of
buffer area). If that happens the XDP path does a xdp_linearize_page
operation.

V3: Adjust frame_sz in receive_mergeable() case, spotted by Jason Wang.

The code is really hard to follow, so some hints to reviewers.
The receive_mergeable() case gets frames that were allocated in
add_recvbuf_mergeable() which uses headroom=virtnet_get_headroom(),
and 'buf' ptr is advanced this headroom.  The headroom can only
be 0 or VIRTIO_XDP_HEADROOM, as virtnet_get_headroom is really
simple:

  static unsigned int virtnet_get_headroom(struct virtnet_info *vi)
  {
	return vi->xdp_queue_pairs ? VIRTIO_XDP_HEADROOM : 0;
  }

As frame_sz is an offset size from xdp.data_hard_start, reviewers
should notice how this is calculated in receive_mergeable():

  int offset = buf - page_address(page);
  [...]
  data = page_address(xdp_page) + offset;
  xdp.data_hard_start = data - VIRTIO_XDP_HEADROOM + vi->hdr_len;

The calculated offset will always be VIRTIO_XDP_HEADROOM when
reaching this code.  Thus, xdp.data_hard_start will be page-start
address plus vi->hdr_len.  Given this xdp.frame_sz need to be
reduced with vi->hdr_len size.

IMHO a followup patch should cleanup this code to make it easier
to maintain and understand, but it is outside the scope of this
patchset.
