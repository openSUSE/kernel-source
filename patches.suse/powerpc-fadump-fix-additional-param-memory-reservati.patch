Subject: [PATCH 2/4] powerpc/fadump: fix additional param memory reservation
 for HASH MMU

References: bsc#1236743 ltc#211409
Patch-mainline: Submitted https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linuxppc-dev/list/?series=441488

Commit 683eab94da75bc ("powerpc/fadump: setup additional parameters for
dump capture kernel") introduced the additional parameter feature in
fadump for HASH MMU with the understanding that GRUB does not use the
memory area between 640MB and 768MB for its operation.

However, the third patch in this series ("powerpc: increase MIN RMA
size for CAS negotiation") changes the MIN RMA size to 768MB, allowing
GRUB to use memory up to 768MB. This makes the fadump reservation for
the additional parameter feature for HASH MMU unreliable.

To address this, adjust the memory range for the additional parameter in
fadump for HASH MMU. This will ensure that GRUB does not overwrite the
memory reserved for fadump's additional parameter in HASH MMU.

The new policy for the memory range for the additional parameter in HASH
MMU is that the first memory block must be larger than the MIN_RMA size,
as the bootloader can use memory up to the MIN_RMA size. The range
should be between MIN_RMA and the RMA size (ppc64_rma_size), and it must
not overlap with the fadump reserved area.
