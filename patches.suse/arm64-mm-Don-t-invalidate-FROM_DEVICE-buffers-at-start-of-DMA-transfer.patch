Subject: arm64: mm: Don't invalidate FROM_DEVICE buffers at start of DMA
 transfer
Git-commit: c50f11c6196f45c92ca48b16a5071615d4ae0572
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc3

Invalidating the buffer memory in arch_sync_dma_for_device() for
FROM_DEVICE transfers

When using the streaming DMA API to map a buffer prior to inbound
non-coherent DMA (i.e. DMA_FROM_DEVICE), we invalidate any dirty CPU
cachelines so that they will not be written back during the transfer and
corrupt the buffer contents written by the DMA. This, however, poses two
potential problems:

  (1) If the DMA transfer does not write to every byte in the buffer,
      then the unwritten bytes will contain stale data once the transfer
      has completed.

  (2) If the buffer has a virtual alias in userspace, then stale data
      may be visible via this alias during the period between performing
      the cache invalidation and the DMA writes landing in memory.

Address both of these issues by cleaning (aka writing-back) the dirty
lines in arch_sync_dma_for_device(DMA_FROM_DEVICE) instead of discarding
them using invalidation.
