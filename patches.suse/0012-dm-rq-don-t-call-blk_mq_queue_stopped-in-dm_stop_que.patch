Subject: [PATCH] dm rq: don't call blk_mq_queue_stopped() in dm_stop_queue()
Git-commit: e766668c6cd49d741cfb49eaeb38998ba34d27bc
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc1
References: git fixes (block drivers)

dm_stop_queue() only uses blk_mq_quiesce_queue() so it doesn't
formally stop the blk-mq queue; therefore there is no point making the
blk_mq_queue_stopped() check -- it will never be stopped.

In addition, even though dm_stop_queue() actually tries to quiesce hw
queues via blk_mq_quiesce_queue(), checking with blk_queue_quiesced()
to avoid unnecessary queue quiesce isn't reliable because: the
QUEUE_FLAG_QUIESCED flag is set before synchronize_rcu() and
dm_stop_queue() may be called when synchronize_rcu() from another
blk_mq_quiesce_queue() is in-progress.

Fixes: 7b17c2f7292ba ("dm: Fix a race condition related to stopping and starting queues")
