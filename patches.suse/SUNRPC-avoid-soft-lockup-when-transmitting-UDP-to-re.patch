Subject: [PATCH] SUNRPC: avoid soft lockup when transmitting UDP to reachable
 server.
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
Git-commit: 6258cf25d5e3155c3219ab5a79b970eef7996356
References: bsc#1225272 bsc#1231016

Prior to the commit identified below, call_transmit_status() would
handle -EPERM and other errors related to an unreachable server by
falling through to call_status() which added a 3-second delay and
handled the failure as a timeout.

Since that commit, call_transmit_status() falls through to
handle_bind().  For UDP this moves straight on to handle_connect() and
handle_transmit() so we immediately retransmit - and likely get the same
error.

This results in an indefinite loop in __rpc_execute() which triggers a
soft-lockup warning.

For the errors that indicate an unreachable server,
call_transmit_status() should fall back to call_status() as it did
before.  This cannot cause the thundering herd that the previous patch
was avoiding, as the call_status() will insert a delay.

Fixes: ed7dc973bd91 ("SUNRPC: Prevent thundering herd when the socket is not connected")
