Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: fix improper generation check in snapshot delete
Git-commit: d75d72a858f0c00ca8ae161b48cdb403807be4de
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc4
References: git-fixes

We have been using the following check

   if (generation <= root->root_key.offset)

to make decisions about whether or not to visit a node during snapshot
delete.  This is because for normal subvolumes this is set to 0, and for
snapshots it's set to the creation generation.  The idea being that if
the generation of the node is less than or equal to our creation
generation then we don't need to visit that node, because it doesn't
belong to us, we can simply drop our reference and move on.

However reloc roots don't have their generation stored in
root->root_key.offset, instead that is the objectid of their
corresponding fs root.  This means we can incorrectly not walk into
nodes that need to be dropped when deleting a reloc root.

There are a variety of consequences to making the wrong choice in two
distinct areas.

visit_node_for_delete()

1. False positive.  We think we are newer than the block when we really
   aren't.  We don't visit the node and drop our reference to the node
   and carry on.  This would result in leaked space.
2. False negative.  We do decide to walk down into a block that we
   should have just dropped our reference to.  However this means that
   the child node will have refs > 1, so we will switch to
   UPDATE_BACKREF, and then the subsequent walk_down_proc() will notice
   that btrfs_header_owner(node) != root->root_key.objectid and it'll
   break out of the loop, and then walk_up_proc() will drop our reference,
   so this appears to be ok.

do_walk_down()

1. False positive.  We are in UPDATE_BACKREF and incorrectly decide that
   we are done and don't need to update the backref for our lower nodes.
   This is another case that simply won't happen with relocation, as we
   only have to do UPDATE_BACKREF if the node below us was shared and
   didn't have FULL_BACKREF set, and since we don't own that node
   because we're a reloc root we actually won't end up in this case.
2. False negative.  Again this is tricky because as described above, we
   simply wouldn't be here from relocation, because we don't own any of
   the nodes because we never set btrfs_header_owner() to the reloc root
   objectid, and we always use FULL_BACKREF, we never actually need to
   set FULL_BACKREF on any children.

Having spent a lot of time stressing relocation/snapshot delete recently
I've not seen this pop in practice.  But this is objectively incorrect,
so fix this to get the correct starting generation based on the root
we're dropping to keep me from thinking there's a problem here.
