A bug was reported against a distribution kernel about a regression related
to an application that has very large numbers of threads operating on
large amounts of memory with a mix of page faults and address space
modifications. System CPU usage was higher and elapsed time was much
reduced.

Part of the problem is that the application relies on threads and their
placement. As cloned threads remain local to the node if there is an
idle CPU, they contend heavily on the LRU spinlock when faulting
memory. It also creates a large imbalance of CPU utilisation until
the load balancer which does not happen quickly enough. As NUMA
balancing is disabled as the application is partially NUMA aware,
the situation never recovers.

This is not a representative test case, but similar symptoms can
be seen with a benchmark that faults pages in parallel

The system has 48 cores in total, note the decrease in system CPU
usage and the large decrease in elapsed time when one node is
almost full.

This imbalance is not the best possible solution. Ideally it would
be reconciled with adjust_numa_imbalance() but that was a regression
magnet when it first tried to allow imbalances. This is the minimal
fix to act as a baseline before trying to reconcile all the imbalance
handling cross nodes.
