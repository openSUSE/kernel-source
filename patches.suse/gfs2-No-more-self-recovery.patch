Subject: [PATCH] gfs2: No more self recovery
Git-commit: deb016c1669002e48c431d6fd32ea1c20ef41756
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc1
References: bsc#1248639 CVE-2025-38659

When a node withdraws and it turns out that it is the only node that has
the filesystem mounted, gfs2 currently tries to replay the local journal
to bring the filesystem back into a consistent state.  Not only is that
a very bad idea, it has also never worked because gfs2_recover_func()
will refuse to do anything during a withdraw.

However, before even getting to this point, gfs2_recover_func()
dereferences sdp->sd_jdesc->jd_inode.  This was a use-after-free before
commit 04133b607a78 ("gfs2: Prevent double iput for journal on error")
and is a NULL pointer dereference since then.

Simply get rid of self recovery to fix that.

Fixes: 601ef0d52e96 ("gfs2: Force withdraw to replay journals and wait for it to finish")
