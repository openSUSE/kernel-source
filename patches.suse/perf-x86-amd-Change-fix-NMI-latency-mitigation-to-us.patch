Subject: perf/x86/amd: Change/fix NMI latency mitigation to use a timestamp
Git-commit: df4d29732fdad43a51284f826bec3e6ded177540
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc3
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.9

It turns out that the NMI latency workaround from commit:

  6d3edaae16c6 ("x86/perf/amd: Resolve NMI latency issues for active PMCs")

ends up being too conservative and results in the perf NMI handler claiming
NMIs too easily on AMD hardware when the NMI watchdog is active.

This has an impact, for example, on the hpwdt (HPE watchdog timer) module.
This module can produce an NMI that is used to reset the system. It
registers an NMI handler for the NMI_UNKNOWN type and relies on the fact
that nothing has claimed an NMI so that its handler will be invoked when
the watchdog device produces an NMI. After the referenced commit, the
hpwdt module is unable to process its generated NMI if the NMI watchdog is
active, because the current NMI latency mitigation results in the NMI
being claimed by the perf NMI handler.

Update the AMD perf NMI latency mitigation workaround to, instead, use a
window of time. Whenever a PMC is handled in the perf NMI handler, set a
timestamp which will act as a perf NMI window. Any NMIs arriving within
that window will be claimed by perf. Anything outside that window will
not be claimed by perf. The value for the NMI window is set to 100 msecs.
This is a conservative value that easily covers any NMI latency in the
hardware. While this still results in a window in which the hpwdt module
will not receive its NMI, the window is now much, much smaller.
