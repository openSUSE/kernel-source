Subject: [PATCH] s390/cio: fix race condition during online processing
Patch-mainline: Not yet, patches submitted by IBM
References: bsc#1219485 bsc#1219451

A race condition exists in ccw_device_set_online() that can cause the
online process to fail, leaving the affected device in an inconsistent
state. As a result, subsequent attempts to set that device online fail
with return code ENODEV.

The problem occurs when a path verification request arrives after
a wait for final device state completed, but before the result state
is evaluated.

Fix this by ensuring that the CCW-device lock is held between
determining final state and checking result state.

Note that since:

commit 2297791c92d0 ("s390/cio: dont unregister subchannel from child-drivers")

path verification requests are much more likely to occur during boot,
resulting in an increased chance of this race condition occurring.

Fixes: 2297791c92d0 ("s390/cio: dont unregister subchannel from child-drivers")
