Subject: idpf: Interpret .set_channels() input differently
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc1
Git-commit: 5e7695e0219bf6acb96081af3ba0ca08b1829656
References: git-fixes

Unlike ice, idpf does not check, if user has requested at least 1 combined
channel. Instead, it relies on a check in the core code. Unfortunately, the
check does not trigger for us because of the hacky .set_channels()
interpretation logic that is not consistent with the core code.

This naturally leads to user being able to trigger a crash with an invalid
input. This is how:

1. ethtool -l <IFNAME> -> combined: 40
2. ethtool -L <IFNAME> rx 0 tx 0
   combined number is not specified, so command becomes {rx_count = 0,
   tx_count = 0, combined_count = 40}.
3. ethnl_set_channels checks, if there is at least 1 RX and 1 TX channel,
   comparing (combined_count + rx_count) and (combined_count + tx_count)
   to zero. Obviously, (40 + 0) is greater than zero, so the core code
   deems the input OK.
4. idpf interprets `rx 0 tx 0` as 0 channels and tries to proceed with such
   configuration.

The issue has to be solved fundamentally, as current logic is also known to
cause AF_XDP problems in ice [0].

Interpret the command in a way that is more consistent with ethtool
manual [1] (--show-channels and --set-channels) and new ice logic.

Considering that in the idpf driver only the difference between RX and TX
queues forms dedicated channels, change the correct way to set number of
channels to:

ethtool -L <IFNAME> combined 10 /* For symmetric queues */
ethtool -L <IFNAME> combined 8 tx 2 rx 0 /* For asymmetric queues */
