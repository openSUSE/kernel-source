Subject: drm/i915: Bump GLK CDCLK frequency when driving multiple pipes

Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: jsc#PED-3527 jsc#PED-5475 jsc#PED-6068 jsc#PED-6070 jsc#PED-6116 jsc#PED-6120 jsc#PED-5065 jsc#PED-5477 jsc#PED-5511 jsc#PED-6041 jsc#PED-6069 jsc#PED-6071

On GLK CDCLK frequency needs to be at least 2*96 MHz when accessing
the audio hardware. Currently we bump the CDCLK frequency up
temporarily (if not high enough already) whenever audio hardware
is being accessed, and drop it back down afterwards.

With a single active pipe this works just fine as we can switch
between all the valid CDCLK frequencies by changing the cd2x
divider, which doesn't require a full modeset. However with
multiple active pipes the cd2x divider trick no longer works,
and thus we end up blinking all displays off and back on.

To avoid this let's just bump the CDCLK frequency to >=2*96MHz
whenever multiple pipes are active. The downside is slightly
higher power consumption, but that seems like an acceptable
tradeoff. With a single active pipe we can stick to the current
more optiomal (from power comsumption POV) behaviour.
