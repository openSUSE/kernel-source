Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda: Match both PCI ID and SSID for driver blacklist
Git-commit: 977dfef40c8996b69afe23a9094d184049efb7bb
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc4
References: git-fixes

The commit 3c6fd1f07ed0 ("ALSA: hda: Add driver blacklist") added a
new blacklist for the devices that are known to have empty codecs, and
one of the entries was ASUS ROG Zenith II (PCI SSID 1043:874f).
However, it turned out that the very same PCI SSID is used for the
previous model that does have the valid HD-audio codecs and the change
broke the sound on it.

Since the empty codec problem appear on the certain AMD platform (PCI
ID 1022:1487), this patch changes the blacklist matching to both PCI
ID and SSID using pci_match_id().  Also, the entry that was removed by
the previous fix for ASUS ROG Zenigh II is re-added.
