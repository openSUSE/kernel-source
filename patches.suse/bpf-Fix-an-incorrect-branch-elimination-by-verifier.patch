Subject: bpf: Fix an incorrect branch elimination by verifier
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc5
Git-commit: 01c66c48d4f0825a202d4163800b706a1d2ec7ad
References: bsc#1177028

Wenbo reported an issue in [1] where a checking of null
pointer is evaluated as always false. In this particular
case, the program type is tp_btf and the pointer to
compare is a PTR_TO_BTF_ID.

The current verifier considers PTR_TO_BTF_ID always
reprents a non-null pointer, hence all PTR_TO_BTF_ID compares
to 0 will be evaluated as always not-equal, which resulted
in the branch elimination.

For example,
 struct bpf_fentry_test_t {
     struct bpf_fentry_test_t *a;
 };
 int BPF_PROG(test7, struct bpf_fentry_test_t *arg)
 {
     if (arg == 0)
         test7_result = 1;
     return 0;
 }
 int BPF_PROG(test8, struct bpf_fentry_test_t *arg)
 {
     if (arg->a == 0)
         test8_result = 1;
     return 0;
 }

In above bpf programs, both branch arg == 0 and arg->a == 0
are removed. This may not be what developer expected.

The bug is introduced by Commit cac616db39c2 ("bpf: Verifier
track null pointer branch_taken with JNE and JEQ"),
where PTR_TO_BTF_ID is considered to be non-null when evaluting
pointer vs. scalar comparison. This may be added
considering we have PTR_TO_BTF_ID_OR_NULL in the verifier
as well.

PTR_TO_BTF_ID_OR_NULL is added to explicitly requires
a non-NULL testing in selective cases. The current generic
pointer tracing framework in verifier always
assigns PTR_TO_BTF_ID so users does not need to
check NULL pointer at every pointer level like a->b->c->d.

We may not want to assign every PTR_TO_BTF_ID as
PTR_TO_BTF_ID_OR_NULL as this will require a null test
before pointer dereference which may cause inconvenience
for developers. But we could avoid branch elimination
to preserve original code intention.

This patch simply removed PTR_TO_BTD_ID from reg_type_not_null()
in verifier, which prevented the above branches from being eliminated.
