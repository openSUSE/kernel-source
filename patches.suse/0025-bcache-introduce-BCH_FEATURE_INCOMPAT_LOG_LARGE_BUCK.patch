Subject: [PATCH] bcache: introduce BCH_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_LOG_LARGE_BUCKET_SIZE
 for large bucket
Git-commit: b16671e8f493e3df40b1fb0dff4078f391c5099a
Patch-mainline: v5.11-rc3
References: git-fixes

When large bucket feature was added, BCH_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_LARGE_BUCKET
was introduced into the incompat feature set. It used bucket_size_hi
(which was added at the tail of struct cache_sb_disk) to extend current
16bit bucket size to 32bit with existing bucket_size in struct
cache_sb_disk.

This is not a good idea, there are two obvious problems,
- Bucket size is always value power of 2, if store log2(bucket size) in
  existing bucket_size of struct cache_sb_disk, it is unnecessary to add
  bucket_size_hi.
- Macro csum_set() assumes d[SB_JOURNAL_BUCKETS] is the last member in
  struct cache_sb_disk, bucket_size_hi was added after d[] which makes
  csum_set calculate an unexpected super block checksum.

To fix the above problems, this patch introduces a new incompat feature
bit BCH_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_LOG_LARGE_BUCKET_SIZE, when this bit is set, it
means bucket_size in struct cache_sb_disk stores the order of power-of-2
bucket size value. When user specifies a bucket size larger than 32768
sectors, BCH_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_LOG_LARGE_BUCKET_SIZE will be set to
incompat feature set, and bucket_size stores log2(bucket size) more
than store the real bucket size value.

The obsoleted BCH_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_LARGE_BUCKET won't be used anymore,
it is renamed to BCH_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_OBSO_LARGE_BUCKET and still only
recognized by kernel driver for legacy compatible purpose. The previous
bucket_size_hi is renmaed to obso_bucket_size_hi in struct cache_sb_disk
and not used in bcache-tools anymore.

For cache device created with BCH_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_LARGE_BUCKET feature,
bcache-tools and kernel driver still recognize the feature string and
display it as "obso_large_bucket".

With this change, the unnecessary extra space extend of bcache on-disk
super block can be avoided, and csum_set() may generate expected check
sum as well.
