Subject: [PATCH] PCI: vmd: Assign VMD IRQ domain before enumeration
Message-Id: <20220502084900.7903-2-nirmal.patel@linux.intel.com>
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
Git-commit: 886e67100b904cb1b106ed1dfa8a60696aff519a
References: bsc#1199405

VMD creates and assigns a separate IRQ domain when MSI-X remapping is
enabled. For example VMD-MSI. But VMD doesn't assign IRQ domain when
MSI-X remapping is disabled resulting child devices getting default
PCI-MSI IRQ domain. Now when interrupt remapping is enabled by
intel-iommu all the PCI devices are assigned INTEL-IR-MSI domain
including VMD endpoints. But devices behind VMD get PCI-MSI IRQ domain
when VMD create a root bus and configures child devices.

As a result DMAR errors were observed when interrupt remapping was
enabled on Intel Icelake CPUs. For instance:

  DMAR: DRHD: handling fault status reg 2
  DMAR: [INTR-REMAP] Request device [0xe2:0x00.0] fault index 0xa00 [fault reason 0x25] Blocked a compatibility format interrupt request
