Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

First the simplest ones:

	- iosys_map_memset(): when abstracting system and I/O memory,
	  just like the memcpy() use case, memset() also has dedicated
	  functions to be called for using IO memory.
	- iosys_map_memcpy_from(): we may need to copy data from I/O
	  memory, not only to.

In certain situations it's useful to be able to read or write to an
offset that is calculated by having the memory layout given by a struct
declaration. Usually we are going to read/write a u8, u16, u32 or u64.

As a pre-requisite for the implementation, add iosys_map_memcpy_from()
to be the equivalent of iosys_map_memcpy_to(), but in the other
direction. Then add 2 pairs of macros:

	- iosys_map_rd() / iosys_map_wr()
	- iosys_map_rd_field() / iosys_map_wr_field()

The first pair takes the C-type and offset to read/write. The second
pair uses a struct describing the layout of the mapping in order to
calculate the offset and size being read/written.

We could use readb, readw, readl, readq and the write* counterparts,
however due to alignment issues this may not work on all architectures.
If alignment needs to be checked to call the right function, it's not
possible to decide at compile-time which function to call: so just leave
the decision to the memcpy function that will do exactly that.

Finally, in order to use the above macros with a map derived from
another, add another initializer: IOSYS_MAP_INIT_OFFSET().

v2:
  - Rework IOSYS_MAP_INIT_OFFSET() so it doesn't rely on aliasing rules
    within the union
  - Add offset to both iosys_map_rd_field() and iosys_map_wr_field() to
    allow the struct itself to be at an offset from the mapping
  - Add documentation to iosys_map_rd_field() with example and expected
    memory layout
v3:
  - Drop kernel.h include as it's not needed anymore

+ * IOSYS_MAP_INIT_OFFSET - Initializes struct iosys_map from another iosys_map
+ * @map_:	The dma-buf mapping structure to copy from
+ * @offset_:	Offset to add to the other mapping
+ *
+ * Initializes a new iosys_map struct based on another passed as argument. It
+ * does a shallow copy of the struct so it's possible to update the back storage
+ * without changing where the original map points to. It is the equivalent of
+ * doing:
+ *
+ * .. code-block:: c
+ *
+ *	iosys_map map = other_map;
+ *	iosys_map_incr(&map, &offset);
+ *
+ * Example usage:
+ *
+ * .. code-block:: c
+ *
+ *	void foo(struct device *dev, struct iosys_map *base_map)
+ *	{
+ *		...
+ *		struct iosys_map map = IOSYS_MAP_INIT_OFFSET(base_map, FIELD_OFFSET);
+ *		...
+ *	}
+ *
+ * The advantage of using the initializer over just increasing the offset with
+ * iosys_map_incr() like above is that the new map will always point to the
+ * right place of the buffer during its scope. It reduces the risk of updating
+ * the wrong part of the buffer and having no compiler warning about that. If
+ * the assignment to IOSYS_MAP_INIT_OFFSET() is forgotten, the compiler can warn
+ * about the use of uninitialized variable.
