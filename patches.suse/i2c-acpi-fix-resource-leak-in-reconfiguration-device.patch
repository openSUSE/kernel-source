Subject: [PATCH] i2c: acpi: fix resource leak in reconfiguration device addition
Git-commit: 6558b646ce1c2a872fe1c2c7cb116f05a2c1950f
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc5
References: git-fixes stable-5.14.12

acpi_i2c_find_adapter_by_handle() calls bus_find_device() which takes a
reference on the adapter which is never released which will result in a
reference count leak and render the adapter unremovable.  Make sure to
put the adapter after creating the client in the same manner that we do
for OF.
