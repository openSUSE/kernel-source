Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: do not free data reservation in fallback from inline
 due to -ENOSPC
Git-commit: f8da41de0bff9eb1d774a7253da0c9f637c4470a
Patch-mainline: v6.19-rc5
References: git-fixes

If we fail to create an inline extent due to -ENOSPC, we will attempt to
go through the normal COW path, reserve an extent, create an ordered
extent, etc. However we were always freeing the reserved qgroup data,
which is wrong since we will use data. Fix this by freeing the reserved
qgroup data in __cow_file_range_inline() only if we are not doing the
fallback (ret is <= 0).
