Subject: drm/i915: Fix a race between vma / object destruction and unbinding

Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

The vma destruction code was using an unlocked advisory check for
drm_mm_node_allocated() to avoid racing with eviction code unbinding
the vma.

This is very fragile and prohibits the dereference of non-refcounted
pointers of dying vmas after a call to __i915_vma_unbind(). It also
prohibits the dereference of vma->obj of refcounted pointers of
dying vmas after a call to __i915_vma_unbind(), since even if a
refcount is held on the vma, that won't guarantee that its backing
object doesn't get destroyed.

So introduce an unbind under the vm mutex at object destroy time,
removing all weak references of the vma and its object from the
object vma list and from the vm bound list.
