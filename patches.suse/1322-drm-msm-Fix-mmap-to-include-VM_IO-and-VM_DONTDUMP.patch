Subject: drm/msm: Fix mmap to include VM_IO and VM_DONTDUMP
Git-commit: 3466d9e217b337bf473ee629c608e53f9f3ab786
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc4
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

In commit 510410bfc034 ("drm/msm: Implement mmap as GEM object
function") we switched to a new/cleaner method of doing things. That's
good, but we missed a little bit.

Before that commit, we used to _first_ run through the
drm_gem_mmap_obj() case where `obj->funcs->mmap()` was NULL. That meant
that we ran:

  vma->vm_flags |= VM_IO | VM_PFNMAP | VM_DONTEXPAND | VM_DONTDUMP;
  vma->vm_page_prot = pgprot_writecombine(vm_get_page_prot(vma->vm_flags));
  vma->vm_page_prot = pgprot_decrypted(vma->vm_page_prot);

...and _then_ we modified those mappings with our own. Now that
`obj->funcs->mmap()` is no longer NULL we don't run the default
code. It looks like the fact that the vm_flags got VM_IO / VM_DONTDUMP
was important because we're now getting crashes on Chromebooks that
use ARC++ while logging out. Specifically a crash that looks like this
(this is on a 5.10 kernel w/ relevant backports but also seen on a
5.15 kernel):

Let's add the two flags back in.

While we're at it, the fact that we aren't running the default means
that we _don't_ need to clear out VM_PFNMAP, so remove that and save
an instruction.

NOTE: it was confirmed that VM_IO was the important flag to fix the
problem I was seeing, but adding back VM_DONTDUMP seems like a sane
thing to do so I'm doing that too.
