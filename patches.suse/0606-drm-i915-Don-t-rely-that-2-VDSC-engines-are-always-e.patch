Subject: drm/i915: Don't rely that 2 VDSC engines are always enough for pixel
 rate
Git-commit: 8290bcee57dee29dde0ce005968691fa811d87ed
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc1
References: drm-backport-placeholder jsc#PED-3527 jsc#PED-5475 jsc#PED-6068 jsc#PED-6070 jsc#PED-6116 jsc#PED-6120 jsc#PED-5065 jsc#PED-5477 jsc#PED-5511 jsc#PED-6041 jsc#PED-6069 jsc#PED-6071

We are currently having FIFO underruns happening for kms_dsc test case,
problem is that, we check if curreny cdclk is >= pixel rate only if
there is a single VDSC engine enabled(i.e dsc_split=false) however if
we happen to have 2 VDSC engines enabled, we just kinda rely that this
would be automatically enough.
However pixel rate can be even >= than VDSC clock(cdclk) * 2, so in that
case even with 2 VDSC engines enabled, we still need to tweak it up.
So lets compare pixel rate with cdclk * VDSC engine count and
check if it still requires bumping up.
Previously we had to bump up CDCLK many times for similar reasons.

v2: - Use new intel_dsc_get_num_vdsc_instances to determine number of VDSC
      engines, instead of slice count(Ankit Nautiyal)
v3: - s/u8/int/ (Jani Nikula)
v4: - Remove slice count mentions(Ankit Nautiyal)
    - Use DIV_ROUND_UP in order to make sure that resulting CDCLK would
      be always >= than required, after division(Ankit Nautiyal)
