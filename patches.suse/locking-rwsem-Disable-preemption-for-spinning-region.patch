Subject: [PATCH] locking/rwsem: Disable preemption for spinning region
Git-commit: 7cdacc5f52d68a9370f182c844b5b3e6cc975cc1
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: bsc#1207270 jsc#PED-4567

The spinning region rwsem_spin_on_owner() should not be preempted,
however the rwsem_down_write_slowpath() invokes it and don't disable
preemption. Fix it by adding a pair of preempt_disable/enable().
