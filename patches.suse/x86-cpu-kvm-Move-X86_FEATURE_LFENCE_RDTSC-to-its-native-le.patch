Subject: x86/cpu, kvm: Move X86_FEATURE_LFENCE_RDTSC to its native leaf
Git-commit: 84168ae786f8a15a7eb0f79d34f20b8d261ce2f5
Patch-mainline: v6.3-rc1
References: git-fixes

The LFENCE always serializing feature bit was defined as scattered
LFENCE_RDTSC and its native leaf bit position open-coded for KVM.  Add
it to its newly added CPUID leaf 0x80000021 EAX proper.  With
LFENCE_RDTSC in its proper place, the kernel's set_cpu_cap() will
effectively synthesize the feature for KVM going forward.

Also, DE_CFG[1] doesn't need to be set on such CPUs anymore.
