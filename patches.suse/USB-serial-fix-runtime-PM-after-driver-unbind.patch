Subject: USB: serial: fix runtime PM after driver unbind
Git-commit: d51bdb93ca7e71d7fb30a572c7b47ed0194bf3fe
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc3
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.7

Since commit c2b71462d294 ("USB: core: Fix bug caused by duplicate
interface PM usage counter") USB drivers must always balance their
runtime PM gets and puts, including when the driver has already been
unbound from the interface.

Leaving the interface with a positive PM usage counter would prevent a
later bound driver from suspending the device.

Fixes: c2b71462d294 ("USB: core: Fix bug caused by duplicate interface PM usage counter")
