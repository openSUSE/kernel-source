Subject: i2c-cht-wc: Fix lockdep warning
Git-commit: 232219b9a464c2479c98aa589acb1bd3383ae9d6
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.5

When the kernel is build with lockdep support and the i2c-cht-wc driver is
used, the following warning is shown:

                *** DEADLOCK ***

The problem is that the CHT Whiskey Cove PMIC's builtin i2c-adapter is
itself a part of an i2c-client (the PMIC). This means that transfers done
through it take adapter->bus_lock twice, once for the parent i2c-adapter
and once for its own bus_lock. Lockdep does not like this nested locking.

To make lockdep happy in the case of busses with muxes, the i2c-core's
i2c_adapter_lock_bus function calls:

 rt_mutex_lock_nested(&adapter->bus_lock, i2c_adapter_depth(adapter));

But i2c_adapter_depth only works when the direct parent of the adapter is
another adapter, as it is only meant for muxes. In this case there is an
i2c-client and MFD instantiated platform_device in the parent->child chain
between the 2 devices.

This commit overrides the default i2c_lock_operations, passing a hardcoded
depth of 1 to rt_mutex_lock_nested, making lockdep happy.

Note that if there were to be a mux attached to the i2c-wc-cht adapter,
this would break things again since the i2c-mux code expects the
root-adapter to have a locking depth of 0. But the i2c-wc-cht adapter
always has only 1 client directly attached in the form of the charger IC
paired with the CHT Whiskey Cove PMIC.
