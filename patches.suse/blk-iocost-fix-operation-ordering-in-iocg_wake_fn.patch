Subject: [PATCH] blk-iocost: fix operation ordering in iocg_wake_fn()
Git-commit: 5ab189cf3abbc9994bae3be524c5b88589ed56e2
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc4
References: bsc#1202720

iocg_wake_fn() open-codes wait_queue_entry removal and wakeup because it
wants the wq_entry to be always removed whether it ended up waking the
task or not. finish_wait() tests whether wq_entry needs removal without
grabbing the wait_queue lock and expects the waker to use
list_del_init_careful() after all waking operations are complete, which
iocg_wake_fn() didn't do. The operation order was wrong and the regular
list_del_init() was used.

The result is that if a waiter wakes up racing the waker, it can free pop
the wq_entry off stack before the waker is still looking at it, which can
lead to a backtrace like the following.

Fix it by switching to list_del_init_careful() and putting it at the end.
