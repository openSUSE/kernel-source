Subject: arm64/mm: Fix pfn_valid() for ZONE_DEVICE based memory

Git-commit: eeb0753ba27b26f609e61f9950b14f1b934fe429
Patch-mainline: v5.12-rc3
References: git-fixes

pfn_valid() validates a pfn but basically it checks for a valid struct page
backing for that pfn. It should always return positive for memory ranges
backed with struct page mapping. But currently pfn_valid() fails for all
ZONE_DEVICE based memory types even though they have struct page mapping.

pfn_valid() asserts that there is a memblock entry for a given pfn without
MEMBLOCK_NOMAP flag being set. The problem with ZONE_DEVICE based memory is
that they do not have memblock entries. Hence memblock_is_map_memory() will
invariably fail via memblock_search() for a ZONE_DEVICE based address. This
eventually fails pfn_valid() which is wrong. memblock_is_map_memory() needs
to be skipped for such memory ranges. As ZONE_DEVICE memory gets hotplugged
into the system via memremap_pages() called from a driver, their respective
memory sections will not have SECTION_IS_EARLY set.

Normal hotplug memory will never have MEMBLOCK_NOMAP set in their memblock
regions. Because the flag MEMBLOCK_NOMAP was specifically designed and set
for firmware reserved memory regions. memblock_is_map_memory() can just be
skipped as its always going to be positive and that will be an optimization
for the normal hotplug memory. Like ZONE_DEVICE based memory, all normal
hotplugged memory too will not have SECTION_IS_EARLY set for their sections

Skipping memblock_is_map_memory() for all non early memory sections would
fix pfn_valid() problem for ZONE_DEVICE based memory and also improve its
performance for normal hotplug memory as well.
