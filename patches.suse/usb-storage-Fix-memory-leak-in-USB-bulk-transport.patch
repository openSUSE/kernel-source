Subject: [PATCH] usb: storage: Fix memory leak in USB bulk transport
Git-commit: 41e99fe2005182139b1058db71f0d241f8f0078c
Patch-mainline: v6.18
References: git-fixes

A kernel memory leak was identified by the 'ioctl_sg01' test from Linux
Test Project (LTP). The following bytes were mainly observed: 0x53425355.

When USB storage devices incorrectly skip the data phase with status data,
the code extracts/validates the CSW from the sg buffer, but fails to clear
it afterwards. This leaves status protocol data in srb's transfer buffer,
such as the US_BULK_CS_SIGN 'USBS' signature observed here. Thus, this can
lead to USB protocols leaks to user space through SCSI generic (/dev/sg*)
interfaces, such as the one seen here when the LTP test requested 512 KiB.

Fix the leak by zeroing the CSW data in srb's transfer buffer immediately
after the validation of devices that skip data phase.

Note: Differently from CVE-2018-1000204, which fixed a big leak by zero-
ing pages at allocation time, this leak occurs after allocation, when USB
protocol data is written to already-allocated sg pages.

Fixes: a45b599ad808 ("scsi: sg: allocate with __GFP_ZERO in sg_build_indirect()")
