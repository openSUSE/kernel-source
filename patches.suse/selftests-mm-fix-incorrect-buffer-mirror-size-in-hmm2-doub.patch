Subject: selftests/mm: fix incorrect buffer->mirror size in hmm2 double_map
 test
MIME-Version: 1.0

Git-commit: 76503e1fa1a53ef041a120825d5ce81c7fe7bdd7
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc3
References: bsc#1242203

The hmm2 double_map test was failing due to an incorrect buffer->mirror
size.  The buffer->mirror size was 6, while buffer->ptr size was 6 *
PAGE_SIZE.  The test failed because the kernel's copy_to_user function was
attempting to copy a 6 * PAGE_SIZE buffer to buffer->mirror.  Since the
size of buffer->mirror was incorrect, copy_to_user failed.

This patch corrects the buffer->mirror size to 6 * PAGE_SIZE.

Test Result without this patch

 # double_map: Test terminated by assertion
 #          FAIL  hmm2.hmm2_device_private.double_map

Test Result with this patch
===========================
 #  RUN           hmm2.hmm2_device_private.double_map ...
 #            OK  hmm2.hmm2_device_private.double_map
