Subject: [PATCH] vfio-mdev: Wire in a request handler for mdev parent
Patch-mainline: v5.11-rc1
Git-commit: a15ac665b9e9c90b1557499f2a46c1e89d29154a
References: bsc#1183225

While performing some destructive tests with vfio-ccw, where the
paths to a device are forcible removed and thus the device itself
is unreachable, it is rather easy to end up in an endless loop in
vfio_del_group_dev() due to the lack of a request callback for the
associated device.

In this example, one MDEV (77c) is used by a guest, while another
(77b) is not. The symptom is that the iommu is detached from the
mdev for 77b, but not 77c, until that guest is shutdown:

    [  238.794867] vfio_ccw 0.0.077b: MDEV: Unregistering
    [  238.794996] vfio_mdev 11f2d2bc-4083-431d-a023-eff72715c4f0: Removing from iommu group 2
    [  238.795001] vfio_mdev 11f2d2bc-4083-431d-a023-eff72715c4f0: MDEV: detaching iommu
    [  238.795036] vfio_ccw 0.0.077c: MDEV: Unregistering
    ...silence...

Let's wire in the request call back to the mdev device, so that a
device being physically removed from the host can be (gracefully?)
handled by the parent device at the time the device is removed.

Add a message when registering the device if a driver doesn't
provide this callback, so a clue is given that this same loop
may be encountered in a similar situation, and a message when
this occurs instead of the awkward silence noted above.
