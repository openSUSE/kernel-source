Subject: Btrfs: fix qgroup double free after failure to reserve metadata for
 delalloc
Git-commit: c7967fc1499beb9b70bb9d33525fb0b384af8883
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc5
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.8

If we fail to reserve metadata for delalloc operations we end up releasing
the previously reserved qgroup amount twice, once explicitly under the
'out_qgroup' label by calling btrfs_qgroup_free_meta_prealloc() and once
again, under label 'out_fail', by calling btrfs_inode_rsv_release() with a
value of 'true' for its 'qgroup_free' argument, which results in
btrfs_qgroup_free_meta_prealloc() being called again, so we end up having
a double free.

Also if we fail to reserve the necessary qgroup amount, we jump to the
label 'out_fail', which calls btrfs_inode_rsv_release() and that in turns
calls btrfs_qgroup_free_meta_prealloc(), even though we weren't able to
reserve any qgroup amount. So we freed some amount we never reserved.

So fix this by removing the call to btrfs_inode_rsv_release() in the
failure path, since it's not necessary at all as we haven't changed the
inode's block reserve in any way at this point.
