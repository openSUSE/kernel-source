Subject: [PATCH] loop: fix the the direct I/O support check when used on top
 of block devices
Git-commit: baa7d536077dcdfe2b70c476a8873d1745d3de0f
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: bsc#1234143

__loop_update_dio only checks the alignment requirement for block backed
file systems, but misses them for the case where the loop device is
created directly on top of another block device.  Due to this creating
a loop device with default option plus the direct I/O flag on a > 512 byte
sector size file system will lead to incorrect I/O being submitted to the
lower block device and a lot of error from the lock layer.  This can
be seen with xfstests generic/563.

Fix the code in __loop_update_dio by factoring the alignment check into
a helper, and calling that also for the struct block_device of a block
device inode.

Also remove the TODO comment talking about dynamically switching between
buffered and direct I/O, which is a would be a recipe for horrible
performance and occasional data loss.
