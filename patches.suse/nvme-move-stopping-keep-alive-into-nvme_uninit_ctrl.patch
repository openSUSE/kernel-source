Subject: [PATCH] nvme: move stopping keep-alive into nvme_uninit_ctrl()
Git-commit: a54a93d0e3599b05856971734e15418ac551a14c
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc5
References: CVE-2024-45013 bsc#1230442

Commit 4733b65d82bd ("nvme: start keep-alive after admin queue setup")
moves starting keep-alive from nvme_start_ctrl() into
nvme_init_ctrl_finish(), but don't move stopping keep-alive into
nvme_uninit_ctrl(), so keep-alive work can be started and keep pending
after failing to start controller, finally use-after-free is triggered if
nvme host driver is unloaded.

This patch fixes kernel panic when running nvme/004 in case that connection
failure is triggered, by moving stopping keep-alive into nvme_uninit_ctrl().

This way is reasonable because keep-alive is now started in
nvme_init_ctrl_finish().

Fixes: 3af755a46881 ("nvme: move nvme_stop_keep_alive() back to original position")
