Subject: scsi: bfa: Double-free fix
Git-commit: add4c4850363d7c1b72e8fce9ccb21fdd2cf5dc9
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc1
References: CVE-2025-38699 bsc#1249224

When the bfad_im_probe() function fails during initialization, the memory
pointed to by bfad->im is freed without setting bfad->im to NULL.

Subsequently, during driver uninstallation, when the state machine enters
the bfad_sm_stopping state and calls the bfad_im_probe_undo() function,
it attempts to free the memory pointed to by bfad->im again, thereby
triggering a double-free vulnerability.

Set bfad->im to NULL if probing fails.
