Subject: [PATCH 23/26] net: bcmgenet: Use stronger register read/writes to
 assure ordering
Git-commit: 8d3ea3d402db94b61075617e71b67459a714a502
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: git-fixes CVE-2022-49194 bsc#1238453

GCC12 appears to be much smarter about its dependency tracking and is
aware that the relaxed variants are just normal loads and stores and
this is causing problems like:

The assumption when these were relaxed seems to be that device memory
would be mapped non reordering, and that other constructs
(spinlocks/etc) would provide the barriers to assure that packet data
and in memory rings/queues were ordered with respect to device
register reads/writes. This itself seems a bit sketchy, but the real
problem with GCC12 is that it is moving the actual reads/writes around
at will as though they were independent operations when in truth they
are not, but the compiler can't know that. When looking at the
assembly dumps for many of these routines its possible to see very
clean, but not strictly in program order operations occurring as the
compiler would be free to do if these weren't actually register
reads/write operations.

Its possible to suppress the timeout with a liberal bit of dma_mb()'s
sprinkled around but the device still seems unable to reliably
send/receive data. A better plan is to use the safer readl/writel
everywhere.

Since this partially reverts an older commit, which notes the use of
the relaxed variants for performance reasons. I would suggest that
any performance problems with this commit are targeted at relaxing only
the performance critical code paths after assuring proper barriers.
