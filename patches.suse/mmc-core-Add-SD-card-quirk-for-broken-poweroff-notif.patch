Subject: [PATCH] mmc: core: Add SD card quirk for broken poweroff notification
Git-commit: cd068d51594d9635bf6688fc78717572b78bce6a
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
References: stable-fixes

GIGASTONE Gaming Plus microSD cards manufactured on 02/2022 report that
they support poweroff notification and cache, but they are not working
correctly.

Flush Cache bit never gets cleared in sd_flush_cache() and Poweroff
Notification Ready bit also never gets set to 1 within 1 second from the
end of busy of CMD49 in sd_poweroff_notify().

This leads to I/O error and runtime PM error state.

I observed that the same card manufactured on 01/2024 works as expected.

This problem seems similar to the Kingston cards fixed with
commit c467c8f08185 ("mmc: Add MMC_QUIRK_BROKEN_SD_CACHE for Kingston
Canvas Go Plus from 11/2019") and should be handled using quirks.

CID for the problematic card is here.
12345641535443002000000145016200

Manufacturer ID is 0x12 and defined as CID_MANFID_GIGASTONE as of now,
but would like comments on what naming is appropriate because MID list
is not public and not sure it's right.
