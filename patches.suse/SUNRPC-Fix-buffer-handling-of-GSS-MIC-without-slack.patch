Subject: SUNRPC: Fix buffer handling of GSS MIC without slack
Git-commit: 5f1bc39979d868a0358c683864bec3fc8395440b
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.4

The GSS Message Integrity Check data for krb5i may lie partially in the XDR
reply buffer's pages and tail.  If so, we try to copy the entire MIC into
free space in the tail.  But as the estimations of the slack space required
for authentication and verification have improved there may be less free
space in the tail to complete this copy -- see commit 2c94b8eca1a2
("SUNRPC: Use au_rslack when computing reply buffer size").  In fact, there
may only be room in the tail for a single copy of the MIC, and not part of
the MIC and then another complete copy.

The real world failure reported is that `ls` of a directory on NFS may
sometimes return -EIO, which can be traced back to xdr_buf_read_netobj()
failing to find available free space in the tail to copy the MIC.

Fix this by checking for the case of the MIC crossing the boundaries of
head, pages, and tail. If so, shift the buffer until the MIC is contained
completely within the pages or tail.  This allows the remainder of the
function to create a sub buffer that directly address the complete MIC.
