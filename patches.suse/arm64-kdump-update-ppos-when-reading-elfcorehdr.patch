Subject: arm64: kdump: update ppos when reading elfcorehdr

Git-commit: 141f8202cfa4192c3af79b6cbd68e7760bb01b5a
Patch-mainline: v5.12-rc5
References: git-fixes

The ppos points to a position in the old kernel memory (and in case of
arm64 in the crash kernel since elfcorehdr is passed as a segment). The
function should update the ppos by the amount that was read. This bug is
not exposed by accident, but other platforms update this value properly.
So, fix it in ARM64 version of elfcorehdr_read() as well.
