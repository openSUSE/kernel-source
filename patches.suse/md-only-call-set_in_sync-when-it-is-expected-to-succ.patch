Subject: md: only call set_in_sync() when it is expected to succeed.
Git-commit: 480523feae581ab714ba6610388a3b4619a2f695
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.4

Since commit 4ad23a976413 ("MD: use per-cpu counter for
writes_pending"), set_in_sync() is substantially more expensive: it
can wait for a full RCU grace period which can be 10s of milliseconds.

So we should only call it when the cost is justified.

md_check_recovery() currently calls set_in_sync() every time it finds
anything to do (on non-external active arrays).  For an array
performing resync or recovery, this will be quite often.
Each call will introduce a delay to the md thread, which can noticeable
affect IO submission latency.

In md_check_recovery() we only need to call set_in_sync() if
'safemode' was non-zero at entry, meaning that there has been not
recent IO.  So we save this "safemode was nonzero" state, and only
call set_in_sync() if it was non-zero.

This measurably reduces mean and maximum IO submission latency during
resync/recovery.
