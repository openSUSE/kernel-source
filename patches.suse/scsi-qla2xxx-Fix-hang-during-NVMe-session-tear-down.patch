Subject: scsi: qla2xxx: Fix hang during NVMe session tear down
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
Git-commit: 310e69edfbd57995868a428eeddea09a7b5d2749
References: bsc#1190941

The following hung task call trace was seen:

    [ 1230.183294] INFO: task qla2xxx_wq:523 blocked for more than 120 seconds.
    [ 1230.197749] "echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs" disables this message.

...when device side port resets were done.

Abort threads were getting out without processing due to the "deleted"
flag check. The delete thread, meanwhile, could not proceed with a
logout (that would have cleared out pending requests) as the logout IOCB
work was not progressing. It appears like the hung qlt_free_session_done()
thread is causing the ha->wq works on hold. The qlt_free_session_done()
was hung waiting for nvme_fc_unregister_remoteport() + localport_delete cb
to be complete, which would only happen when all I/Os are released.

Fix this by allowing abort to progress until device delete is completely
done. This should make the qlt_free_session_done() proceed without hang and
thus clear up the deadlock.
