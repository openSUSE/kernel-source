Subject: [PATCH] net: phy: mscc: Stop clearing the the UDPv4 checksum for L2 frames
Git-commit: 57a92d14659df3e7e7e0052358c8cc68bbbc3b5e
Patch-mainline: v6.16-rc1
References: git-fixes

We have noticed that when PHY timestamping is enabled, L2 frames seems
to be modified by changing two 2 bytes with a value of 0. The place were
these 2 bytes seems to be random(or I couldn't find a pattern).  In most
of the cases the userspace can ignore these frames but if for example
those 2 bytes are in the correction field there is nothing to do.  This
seems to happen when configuring the HW for IPv4 even that the flow is
not enabled.
These 2 bytes correspond to the UDPv4 checksum and once we don't enable
clearing the checksum when using L2 frames then the frame doesn't seem
to be changed anymore.
