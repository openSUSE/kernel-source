Subject: inet_ecn: Fix endianness of checksum update when setting ECT(1)
MIME-Version: 1.0

References: git-fixes

When adding support for propagating ECT(1) marking in IP headers it seems I
suffered from endianness-confusion in the checksum update calculation: In
fact the ECN field is in the *lower* bits of the first 16-bit word of the
IP header when calculating in network byte order. This means that the
addition performed to update the checksum field was wrong; let's fix that.

Fixes: b723748750ec ("tunnel: Propagate ECT(1) when decapsulating as recommended by RFC6040")
