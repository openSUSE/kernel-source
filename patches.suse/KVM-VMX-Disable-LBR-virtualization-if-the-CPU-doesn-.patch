Subject: [PATCH] KVM: VMX: Disable LBR virtualization if the CPU doesn't
 support LBR callstacks

Disable LBR virtualization if the CPU doesn't support callstacks, which
were introduced in HSW (see commit e9d7f7cd97c4 ("perf/x86/intel: Add
basic Haswell LBR call stack support"), as KVM unconditionally configures
the perf LBR event with PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_CALL_STACK, i.e. LBR
virtualization always fails on pre-HSW CPUs.

Simply disable LBR support on such CPUs, as it has never worked, i.e.
there is no risk of breaking an existing setup, and figuring out a way
to performantly context switch LBRs on old CPUs is not worth the effort.
