Subject: selftests: vrf_route_leaking: remove ipv6_ping_frag from default
 testing
Git-commit: c4cf2bc0d2c97214e41b44b2b05cedc7093ccbbd
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc1
References: bsc#1255349

As the initial commit 1a01727676a8 ("selftests: Add VRF route leaking
tests") said, the IPv6 MTU test fails as source address selection
picking ::1. Every time we run the selftest this one report failed.
There seems not much meaning  to keep reporting a failure for 3 years
that no one plan to fix/update. Let't just skip this one first. We can
add it back when the issue fixed.
