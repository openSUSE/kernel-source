Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: intel: fix race condition on system resume
References: jsc#SLE-16518
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/vkoul/soundwire.git
Git-commit: cb1e6d59e89ce272a67e6dc22e9ec72df622fb1b

Previous patches took care of the case where the master device is
pm_runtime 'suspended' when a system suspend occurs.

In the case where the master device was not suspended, e.g. if suspend
occurred while streaming audio, Intel validation noticed a race
Condition: the pm_runtime suspend may conflict with the enumeration
started by the system resume.

This can be simply fixed by updating the status before exiting system
resume.
