Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/papr_scm: Add PAPR command family to pass-through
 command-set

References: bsc#1175052 jsc#SLE-13823 ltc#186863
Patch-mainline: queued
Git-repo: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/powerpc/linux.git
Git-commit: 13135b461cf205941308984bd3271ec7d403dc40

Add NVDIMM_FAMILY_PAPR to the list of valid 'dimm_family_mask'
acceptable by papr_scm. This is needed as since commit
92fe2aa859f5 ("libnvdimm: Validate command family indices") libnvdimm
performs a validation of 'nd_cmd_pkg.nd_family' received as part of
ND_CMD_CALL processing to ensure only known command families can use
the general ND_CMD_CALL pass-through functionality.

Without this change the ND_CMD_CALL pass-through targeting
NVDIMM_FAMILY_PAPR error out with -EINVAL.
