Subject: [PATCH] sched/fair: Fix detection of per-CPU kthreads waking a task

References: bsc#1189999 (Scheduler functional and performance backports)
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
Git-commit: 8b4e74ccb582797f6f0b0a50372ebd9fd2372a27

select_idle_sibling() has a special case for tasks woken up by a per-CPU
kthread, where the selected CPU is the previous one. However, the current
condition for this exit path is incomplete. A task can wake up from an
interrupt context (e.g. hrtimer), while a per-CPU kthread is running. A
such scenario would spuriously trigger the special case described above.
Also, a recent change made the idle task like a regular per-CPU kthread,
hence making that situation more likely to happen
(is_per_cpu_kthread(swapper) being true now).

Checking for task context makes sure select_idle_sibling() will not
interpret a wake up from any other context as a wake up by a per-CPU
kthread.
