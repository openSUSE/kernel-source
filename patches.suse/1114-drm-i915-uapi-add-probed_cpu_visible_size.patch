Subject: drm/i915/uapi: add probed_cpu_visible_size
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: 3f4309cbdc8496373875cfce67d7b5dba87c3ccb
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225 jsc#PED-2849

Userspace wants to know the size of CPU visible portion of device
local-memory, and on small BAR devices the probed_size is no longer
enough. In Vulkan, for example, it would like to know the size in bytes
for CPU visible VkMemoryHeap. We already track the io_size for each
region, so plumb that through to the region query.

v2: Drop the ( -1 = unknown ) stuff, which is confusing since nothing
can currently ever return such a value.
