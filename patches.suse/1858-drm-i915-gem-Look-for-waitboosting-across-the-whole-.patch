Subject: drm/i915/gem: Look for waitboosting across the whole object prior to
 individual waits
Git-commit: ad765fae792e16ce3c1d0b69ce939e3f7dba40ab
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc7
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

We employ a "waitboost" heuristic to detect when userspace is stalled
waiting for results from earlier execution. Under latency sensitive work
mixed between the gpu/cpu, the GPU is typically under-utilised and so
RPS sees that low utilisation as a reason to downclock the frequency,
causing longer stalls and lower throughput. The user left waiting for
the results is not impressed.

On applying commit 047a1b877ed4 ("dma-buf & drm/amdgpu: remove dma_resv
workaround") it was observed that deinterlacing h264 on Haswell
performance dropped by 2-5x. The reason being that the natural workload
was not intense enough to trigger RPS (using HW evaluation intervals) to
upclock, and so it was depending on waitboosting for the throughput.

Commit 047a1b877ed4 ("dma-buf & drm/amdgpu: remove dma_resv workaround")
changes the composition of dma-resv from keeping a single write fence +
multiple read fences, to a single array of multiple write and read
fences (a maximum of one pair of write/read fences per context). The
iteration order was also changed implicitly from all-read fences then
the single write fence, to a mix of write fences followed by read
fences. It is that ordering change that belied the fragility of
waitboosting.

Currently, a waitboost is inspected at the point of waiting on an
outstanding fence. If the GPU is backlogged such that we haven't yet
stated the request we need to wait on, we force the GPU to upclock until
the completion of that request. By changing the order in which we waited
upon requests, we ended up waiting on those requests in sequence and as
such we saw that each request was already started and so not a suitable
candidate for waitboosting.

Instead of asking whether to boost each fence in turn, we can look at
whether boosting is required for the dma-resv ensemble prior to waiting
on any fence, making the heuristic more robust to the order in which
fences are stored in the dma-resv.
