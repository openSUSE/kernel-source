Subject: [PATCH] PCI: Make ACS quirk implementations more uniform
Git-commit: c8de8ed2dcaac82e5d76d467dc0b02e0ee79809b
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: git-fixes

The ACS quirks differ in needless ways, which makes them look more
different than they really are.

Reorder the ACS flags in order of definitions in the spec:

  PCI_ACS_SV   Source Validation
  PCI_ACS_TB   Translation Blocking
  PCI_ACS_RR   P2P Request Redirect
  PCI_ACS_CR   P2P Completion Redirect
  PCI_ACS_UF   Upstream Forwarding
  PCI_ACS_EC   P2P Egress Control
  PCI_ACS_DT   Direct Translated P2P

(PCIe r5.0, sec 7.7.8.2) and use similar code structure in all.  No
functional change intended.
