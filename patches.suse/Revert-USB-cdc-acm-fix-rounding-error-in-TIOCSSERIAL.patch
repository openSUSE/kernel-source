Subject: [PATCH] Revert "USB: cdc-acm: fix rounding error in TIOCSSERIAL"
Git-commit: 729f7955cb987c5b7d7e54c87c5ad71c789934f7
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc1
References: git-fixes

This reverts commit b401f8c4f492cbf74f3f59c9141e5be3071071bb.

The offending commit claimed that trying to set the values reported back
by TIOCGSERIAL as a regular user could result in an -EPERM error when HZ
is 250, but that was never the case.

With HZ=250, the default 0.5 second value of close_delay is converted to
125 jiffies when set and is converted back to 50 centiseconds by
TIOCGSERIAL as expected (not 12 cs as was claimed, even if that was the
case before an earlier fix).

Comparing the internal current and new jiffies values is just fine to
determine if the value is about to change so drop the bogus workaround
(which was also backported to stable).

For completeness: With different default values for these parameters or
with a HZ value not divisible by two, the lack of rounding when setting
the default values in tty_port_init() could result in an -EPERM being
returned, but this is hardly something we need to worry about.
