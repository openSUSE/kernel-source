Subject: [PATCH] sched/eas: Don't update misfit status if the task is pinned
Git-commit: 0ae78eec8aa64e645866e75005162603a77a0f49
Patch-mainline: v5.12-rc1
References: git-fixes

If the task is pinned to a cpu, setting the misfit status means that
we'll unnecessarily continuously attempt to migrate the task but fail.

This continuous failure will cause the balance_interval to increase to
a high value, and eventually cause unnecessary significant delays in
balancing the system when real imbalance happens.

Caught while testing uclamp where rt-app calibration loop was pinned to
cpu 0, shortly after which we spawn another task with high util_clamp
value. The task was failing to migrate after over 40ms of runtime due to
balance_interval unnecessary expanded to a very high value from the
calibration loop.

Not done here, but it could be useful to extend the check for pinning to
verify that the affinity of the task has a cpu that fits. We could end
up in a similar situation otherwise.
