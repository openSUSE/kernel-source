Subject: KVM: arm64: Avoid setting the upper 32 bits of TCR_EL2 and CPTR_EL2
 to 1
Git-commit: 1f80d15020d7f130194821feb1432b67648c632d
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc4
References: bsc#1201442

Having a signed (1 << 31) constant for TCR_EL2_RES1 and CPTR_EL2_TCPAC
causes the upper 32-bit to be set to 1 when assigning them to a 64-bit
variable. Bit 32 in TCR_EL2 is no longer RES0 in ARMv8.7: with FEAT_LPA2
it changes the meaning of bits 49:48 and 9:8 in the stage 1 EL2 page
table entries. As a result of the sign-extension, a non-VHE kernel can
no longer boot on a model with ARMv8.7 enabled.

CPTR_EL2 still has the top 32 bits RES0 but we should preempt any future
problems

Make these top bit constants unsigned as per commit df655b75c43f
("arm64: KVM: Avoid setting the upper 32 bits of VTCR_EL2 to 1").
