Subject: drm: Fix a couple of typos, punctation and whitespace issues
Git-commit: dbe2d2bf79d2675e647d6a22fcb213e30a9b9706
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-12680, jsc#SLE-12880, jsc#SLE-12882, jsc#SLE-12883, jsc#SLE-13496, jsc#SLE-15322

These are just a couple of things that I came across as I was reading
through the code and comments.

v2: added one more hunk that ended up in the wrong patch
