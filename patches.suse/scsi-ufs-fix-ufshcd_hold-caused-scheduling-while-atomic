Subject: scsi: ufs: Fix ufshcd_hold() caused scheduling while atomic
Git-commit: c63d6099a7959ecc919b2549dc6b71f53521f819
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: bsc#1171795

The async version of ufshcd_hold(async == true), which is only called in
queuecommand path as for now, is expected to work in atomic context, thus
it should not sleep or schedule out. When it runs into the condition that
clocks are ON but link is still in hibern8 state, it should bail out
without flushing the clock ungate work.

Fixes: f2a785ac2312 ("scsi: ufshcd: Fix race between clk scaling and ungate work")
