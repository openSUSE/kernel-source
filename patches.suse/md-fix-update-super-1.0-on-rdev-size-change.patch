Subject: [PATCH] md: fix update super 1.0 on rdev size change
Git-commit: 55df1ce0d4e086e05a8ab20619c73c729350f965
Patch-mainline: v5.16
References: git-fixes

The superblock of version 1.0 doesn't get moved to the new position on a
device size change. This leads to a rdev without a superblock on a known
position, the raid can't be re-assembled.

The line was removed by mistake and is re-added by this patch.

Fixes: d9c0fa509eaf ("md: fix max sectors calculation for super 1.0")
