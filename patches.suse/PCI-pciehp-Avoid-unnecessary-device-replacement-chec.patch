Subject: [PATCH] PCI: pciehp: Avoid unnecessary device replacement check
Git-commit: e3260237aaadc9799107ccb940c6688195c4518d
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc1
References: git-fixes CVE-2025-37843 bsc#1242956

Hot-removal of nested PCI hotplug ports suffers from a long-standing race
condition which can lead to a deadlock:  A parent hotplug port acquires
pci_lock_rescan_remove(), then waits for pciehp to unbind from a child
hotplug port.  Meanwhile that child hotplug port tries to acquire
pci_lock_rescan_remove() as well in order to remove its own children.

The deadlock only occurs if the parent acquires pci_lock_rescan_remove()
first, not if the child happens to acquire it first.

Several workarounds to avoid the issue have been proposed and discarded
over the years, e.g.:

A proper fix is being worked on, but needs more time as it is nontrivial
and necessarily intrusive.

Recent commit 9d573d19547b ("PCI: pciehp: Detect device replacement during
system sleep") provokes more frequent occurrence of the deadlock when
removing more than one Thunderbolt device during system sleep.  The commit
sought to detect device replacement, but also triggered on device removal.
Differentiating reliably between replacement and removal is impossible
because pci_get_dsn() returns 0 both if the device was removed, as well as
if it was replaced with one lacking a Device Serial Number.

Avoid the more frequent occurrence of the deadlock by checking whether the
hotplug port itself was hot-removed.  If so, there's no sense in checking
whether its child device was replaced.

This works because the ->resume_noirq() callback is invoked in top-down
order for the entire hierarchy:  A parent hotplug port detecting device
replacement (or removal) marks all children as removed using
pci_dev_set_disconnected() and a child hotplug port can then reliably
detect being removed.
