A customer reported the following softlockup:

It caught the process in the middle of trace_access_unlock(). There is
no loop. So, it must be looping in the caller tracing_read_pipe()
via the "waitagain" label.

Crashdump analyze uncovered that iter->seq was completely zeroed
at this point, including iter->seq.seq.size. It means that
print_trace_line() was never able to print anything and
there was no forward progress.

The culprit seems to be in the code:

	/* reset all but tr, trace, and overruns */
	memset(&iter->seq, 0,
	       sizeof(struct trace_iterator) -
	       offsetof(struct trace_iterator, seq));

It was added by the commit 53d0aa773053ab182877 ("ftrace:
add logic to record overruns"). It was v2.6.27-rc1.
It was the time when iter->seq looked like:

     struct trace_seq {
	unsigned char		buffer[PAGE_SIZE];
	unsigned int		len;
     };

There was no "size" variable and zeroing was perfectly fine.

The solution is to reinitialize the structure after or without
zeroing.
