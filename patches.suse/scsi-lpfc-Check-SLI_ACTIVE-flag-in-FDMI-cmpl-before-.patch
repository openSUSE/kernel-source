Subject: scsi: lpfc: Check SLI_ACTIVE flag in FDMI cmpl before submitting
 follow up FDMI
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
Git-commit: 98f8d3588097e321be70f83b844fa67d4828fe5c
References: bsc#1233241 jsc#PED-9943

The lpfc_cmpl_ct_disc_fdmi() routine has incorrect logic that treats an
FDMI completion with error LOCAL_REJECT/SLI_ABORTED as a success status.
Under the erroneous assumption of successful completion, the routine
proceeds to issue follow up FDMI commands, which may never complete if
the HBA is in an errata state as indicated by the errored completion
status.  Fix by freeing FDMI cmd resources and early return when the
LPFC_SLI_ACTIVE flag is not set and a LOCAL_REJECT/SLI_ABORTED or
SLI_DOWN status is received.
