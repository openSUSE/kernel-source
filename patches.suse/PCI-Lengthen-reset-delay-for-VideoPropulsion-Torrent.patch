Subject: [PATCH] PCI: Lengthen reset delay for VideoPropulsion Torrent QN16e card
Git-commit: c9260693aa0c1e029ed23693cfd4d7814eee6624
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: git-fixes

Commit ac91e6980563 ("PCI: Unify delay handling for reset and resume")
shortened an unconditional 1 sec delay after a Secondary Bus Reset to 100
msec for PCIe (per PCIe r6.1 sec 6.6.1).  The 1 sec delay is only required
for Conventional PCI.

But it turns out that there are PCIe devices which require a longer delay
than prescribed before first config space access after reset recovery or
resume from D3cold:

Chad reports that a "VideoPropulsion Torrent QN16e" MPEG QAM Modulator
"raises a PCI system error (PERR), as reported by the IPMI event log, and
the hardware itself would suffer a catastrophic event, cycling the server"
unless the longer delay is observed.

The card is specified to conform to PCIe r1.0 and indeed only supports Gen1
speed (2.5 GT/s) according to lspci.  PCIe r1.0 sec 7.6 prescribes the same
100 msec delay as PCIe r6.1 sec 6.6.1:

  To allow components to perform internal initialization, system software
  must wait for at least 100 ms from the end of a reset (cold/warm/hot)
  before it is permitted to issue Configuration Requests

The behavior of the Torrent QN16e card thus appears to be a quirk.  Treat
it as such and lengthen the reset delay for this specific device.
