Subject: [PATCH 2/5] security: Add a kernel lockdown flag for early boot stage
Patch-mainline: Never, temporary solution
References: bsc#1234646

This is a a temporary solution. After the patch '77b644c39d6a init/main.c:
Initialize early LSMs after arch code, static keys and calls' be introduced
to v6.12 kernel. The early_security_init() be moved behine setup_arch(). It
causes that thee original code of CONFIG_LOCK_DOWN_IN_EFI_SECURE_BOOT in
setup_arch() is invalid.

The lockdown_early.c file includes two functions which are copied from
security/lockdown/lockdown.c and just simply modified for keeping the
original calling habits. For filling in the gap, I go back to use a
lock flag in early boot stage before the lockdown LSM be initial after
setup_arch(). The reason for creating a new C files instead of direct
modifing lockdown.c is to avoid compromising the security of lockdown LSM.

This solution only be used in limited lock-down functions in setup_arch()
or even in early_initcall stage. I will removed this temporary solution
after the real solution shows on kernel mainline.
