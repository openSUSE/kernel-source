Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: battery: Accept charges over the design capacity as full

Some buggy firmware and/or brand new batteries can support a charge that's
slightly over the reported design capacity. In such cases, the kernel will
report to userspace that the charging state of the battery is "Unknown",
when in reality the battery charge is "Full", at least from the design
capacity point of view. Make the fallback condition accepts capacities
over the designed capacity so userspace knows that is full.
