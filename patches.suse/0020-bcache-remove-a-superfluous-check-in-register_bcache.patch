Subject: [PATCH] bcache:remove a superfluous check in register_bcache
Git-commit: 117ae250cfa3718f21bd07df0650dfbe3bc3a823
Patch-mainline: v5.11-rc1
References: git-fixes

There have no reassign the bdev after check It is IS_ERR.
the double check !IS_ERR(bdev) is superfluous.

After commit 4e7b5671c6a8 ("block: remove i_bdev"),
"Switch the block device lookup interfaces to directly work with a dev_t
so that struct block_device references are only acquired by the
blkdev_get variants (and the blk-cgroup special case).  This means that
we now don't need an extra reference in the inode and can generally
simplify handling of struct block_device to keep the lookups contained
in the core block layer code."

so after lookup_bdev call, there no need to do bdput.

remove a superfluous check the bdev & don't call bdput after lookup_bdev.
