Subject: [PATCH] locking/rt: Take RCU nesting into account for __might_resched()
Git-commit: ef1f4804b27a54da34de6984d16f1fe8f2cc7011
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: bsc#1190137 bsc#1189998

The general rule that rcu_read_lock() held sections cannot voluntary sleep
does apply even on RT kernels. Though the substitution of spin/rw locks on
RT enabled kernels has to be exempt from that rule. On !RT a spin_lock()
can obviously nest inside a RCU read side critical section as the lock
acquisition is not going to block, but on RT this is not longer the case
due to the 'sleeping' spinlock substitution.

The RT patches contained a cheap hack to ignore the RCU nesting depth in
might_sleep() checks, which was a pragmatic but incorrect workaround.

Instead of generally ignoring the RCU nesting depth in __might_sleep() and
__might_resched() checks, pass the rcu_preempt_depth() via the offsets
argument to __might_resched() from spin/read/write_lock() which makes the
checks work correctly even in RCU read side critical sections.

The actual blocking on such a substituted lock within a RCU read side
critical section is already handled correctly in __schedule() by treating
it as a "preemption" of the RCU read side critical section.
