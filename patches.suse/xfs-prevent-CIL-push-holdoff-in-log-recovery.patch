Subject: [PATCH] xfs: prevent CIL push holdoff in log recovery
Git-commit: 8ab39f11d97464bd0f27443f45e43096814d3ccb
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: bsc#1164095

generic/530 on a machine with enough ram and a non-preemptible
kernel can run the AGI processing phase of log recovery enitrely out
of cache. This means it never blocks on locks, never waits for IO
and runs entirely through the unlinked lists until it either
completes or blocks and hangs because it has run out of log space.

It runs out of log space because the background CIL push is
scheduled but never runs. queue_work() queues the CIL work on the
current CPU that is busy, and the workqueue code will not run it on
any other CPU. Hence if the unlinked list processing never yields
the CPU voluntarily, the push work is delayed indefinitely. This
results in the CIL aggregating changes until all the log space is
consumed.

When the log recoveyr processing evenutally blocks, the CIL flushes
but because the last iclog isn't submitted for IO because it isn't
full, the CIL flush never completes and nothing ever moves the log
head forwards, or indeed inserts anything into the tail of the log,
and hence nothing is able to get the log moving again and recovery
hangs.

There are several problems here, but the two obvious ones from
the trace are that:
	a) log recovery does not yield the CPU for over 4 seconds,
	b) binding CIL pushes to a single CPU is a really bad idea.

This patch addresses just these two aspects of the problem, and are
suitable for backporting to work around any issues in older kernels.
The more fundamental problem of preventing the CIL from consuming
more than 50% of the log without committing will take more invasive
and complex work, so will be done as followup work.
