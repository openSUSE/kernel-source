Subject: [PATCH] usbnet: Fix linkwatch use-after-free on disconnect
Git-commit: a69e617e533edddf3fa3123149900f36e0a6dc74
References: git-fixes CVE-2022-50220 bsc#1245348
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1

usbnet uses the work usbnet_deferred_kevent() to perform tasks which may
sleep.  On disconnect, completion of the work was originally awaited in
->ndo_stop().  But in 2003, that was moved to ->disconnect() by historic
commit "[PATCH] USB: usbnet, prevent exotic rtnl deadlock":

  https://git.kernel.org/tglx/history/c/0f138bbfd83c

The change was made because back then, the kernel's workqueue
implementation did not allow waiting for a single work.  One had to wait
for completion of *all* work by calling flush_scheduled_work(), and that
could deadlock when waiting for usbnet_deferred_kevent() with rtnl_mutex
held in ->ndo_stop().

The commit solved one problem but created another:  It causes a
use-after-free in USB Ethernet drivers aqc111.c, asix_devices.c,
ax88179_178a.c, ch9200.c and smsc75xx.c:

* If the drivers receive a link change interrupt immediately before
  disconnect, they raise EVENT_LINK_RESET in their (non-sleepable)
  ->status() callback and schedule usbnet_deferred_kevent().
* usbnet_deferred_kevent() invokes the driver's ->link_reset() callback,
  which calls netif_carrier_{on,off}().
* That in turn schedules the work linkwatch_event().

Because usbnet_deferred_kevent() is awaited after unregister_netdev(),
netif_carrier_{on,off}() may operate on an unregistered netdev and
linkwatch_event() may run after free_netdev(), causing a use-after-free.

In 2010, usbnet was changed to only wait for a single instance of
usbnet_deferred_kevent() instead of *all* work by commit 23f333a2bfaf
("drivers/net: don't use flush_scheduled_work()").

Unfortunately the commit neglected to move the wait back to
->ndo_stop().  Rectify that omission at long last.
