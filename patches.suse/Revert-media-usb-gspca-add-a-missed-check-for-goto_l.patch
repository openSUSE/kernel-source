Subject: [PATCH] Revert "media: usb: gspca: add a missed check for goto_low_power"
Git-commit: fd013265e5b5576a74a033920d6c571e08d7c423
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc3
References: git-fixes

This reverts commit 5b711870bec4dc9a6d705d41e127e73944fa3650.

Because of recent interactions with developers from @umn.edu, all
commits from them have been recently re-reviewed to ensure if they were
correct or not.

Upon review, this commit was found to do does nothing useful as a user
can do nothing with this information and if an error did happen, the
code would continue on as before.  Because of this, just revert it.
