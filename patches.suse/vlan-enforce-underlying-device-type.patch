Subject: vlan: enforce underlying device type
Git-commit: b33a534610067ade2bdaf2052900aaad99701353
References: CVE-2025-21920 bsc#1240686
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc6

Currently, VLAN devices can be created on top of non-ethernet devices.

Besides the fact that it doesn't make much sense, this also causes a
bug which leaks the address of a kernel function to usermode.

When creating a VLAN device, we initialize GARP (garp_init_applicant)
and MRP (mrp_init_applicant) for the underlying device.

As part of the initialization process, we add the multicast address of
each applicant to the underlying device, by calling dev_mc_add.

__dev_mc_add uses dev->addr_len to determine the length of the new
multicast address.

This causes an out-of-bounds read if dev->addr_len is greater than 6,
since the multicast addresses provided by GARP and MRP are only 6
bytes long.

This behaviour can be reproduced using the following commands:

ip tunnel add gretest mode ip6gre local ::1 remote ::2 dev lo
ip l set up dev gretest
ip link add link gretest name vlantest type vlan id 100

Then, the following command will display the address of garp_pdu_rcv:

ip maddr show | grep 01:80:c2:00:00:21

Fix the bug by enforcing the type of the underlying device during VLAN
device initialization.
