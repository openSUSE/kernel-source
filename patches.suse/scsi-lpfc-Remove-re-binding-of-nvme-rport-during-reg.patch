Subject: scsi: lpfc: Remove re-binding of nvme rport during registration
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
Git-commit: b98214f6070ef5052b763b61ac2089a9ac6c8677
References: bsc#1164777 bsc#1164780 bsc#1165211 jsc#SLE-8654

The lldd rebinds the ndlp with rport during a nvme rport registration (via
nvme_fc_register_remoteport). If rport & ndlp pointers are same as the
previous one, the lldd will re-use the ndlp and rport association without
re-initialization. This assumption is incorrect. The lldd should be
ignorant of whether the returned rport pointer is new or not, and should
always assume it is new.

Remove the re-binding code, always assumes that rport pointer received from
transport is a new pointer.
