Subject: drm/i915: Remove lite restore defines
Git-commit: 48d7fb181a9102e4936700367db8d5a04bb12c2c
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-12680, jsc#SLE-12880, jsc#SLE-12882, jsc#SLE-12883, jsc#SLE-13496, jsc#SLE-15322

We have switched from tail manipulation to forced context restore
to implement WaIdleLiteRestore. Remove the old defines and comments.

Note: we still do emit the WA tail, and use it as our first attempt to
avoid forcing a full-restore instead of a lite-restore, we just have a
much stronger backup mechanism for repeated preemptions.
