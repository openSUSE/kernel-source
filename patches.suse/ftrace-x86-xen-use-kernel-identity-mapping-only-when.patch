Subject: [PATCH 3/3] ftrace/x86/xen: use kernel identity mapping only when
 really needed
Patch-mainline: Cleaner solution is needed once the related Xen part gets upstream
Reference: bsc#873195, bsc#886272, bsc#903727, bsc#927725

The dynamic ftrace is not correctly initialized when the kernel is being loaded
using the Xen hypervisor:

The problem is that the kernel identity mapping is set read only very early
in this situation, see make_readonly() that is called from xen_init_pt().

This patch uses the fact that the kernel text mapping is set read only in
kernel_init() that is called after ftrace_init(). Therefore we could safely
use the kernel text mapping during the ftrace initialization.

The change of the kernel text mapping permissions is signalized by the global
variable "kernel_set_to_readonly", see mark_rodata_ro().

A cleaner solution would be to introduce another global variable that would
signalize the change of permissions in the kernel identity mapping. Then we
could create another helper functions that could modify permission only
of the kernel identity mapping and call them from ftrace_init(). Note that
the existing set_kernel_text_rw() and set_kernel_text_ro() modify the kernel
text mapping as well. But this is complicated and can not be accepted upstream
because the Xen code is still not there.
