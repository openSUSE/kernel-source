Subject: [PATCH] selftests/binderfs: use the Makefile's rules, not Make's implicit rules
Git-commit: 019baf635eb6ffe8d6c1343f81788f02a7e0ed98
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc1
References: git-fixes

First of all, in order to build with clang at all, one must first apply
Valentin Obst's build fix for LLVM [1]. Once that is done, then when
building with clang, via:

    make LLVM=1 -C tools/testing/selftests

...the following error occurs:

   clang: error: cannot specify -o when generating multiple output files

This is because clang, unlike gcc, won't accept invocations of this
Form: 

    clang file1.c header2.h

While trying to fix this, I noticed that:

a) selftests/lib.mk already avoids the problem, and

b) The binderfs Makefile indavertently bypasses the selftests/lib.mk
build system, and quitely uses Make's implicit build rules for .c files
instead.

The Makefile attempts to set up both a dependency and a source file,
neither of which was needed, because lib.mk is able to automatically
handle both. This line:

    binderfs_test: binderfs_test.c

...causes Make's implicit rules to run, which builds binderfs_test
without ever looking at lib.mk.

Fix this by simply deleting the "binderfs_test:" Makefile target and
letting lib.mk handle it instead.
