Subject: [PATCH] cifs: allow syscalls to be restarted in __smb_send_rqst()
Git-commit: 6988a619f5b79e4efadea6e19dcfe75fbcd350b5
References: bsc#1176956
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc7

A customer has reported that several files in their multi-threaded app
were left with size of 0 because most of the read(2) calls returned
-EINTR and they assumed no bytes were read.  Obviously, they could
have fixed it by simply retrying on -EINTR.

We noticed that most of the -EINTR on read(2) were due to real-time
signals sent by glibc to process wide credential changes (SIGRT_1),
and its signal handler had been established with SA_RESTART, in which
case those calls could have been automatically restarted by the
kernel.

Let the kernel decide to whether or not restart the syscalls when
there is a signal pending in __smb_send_rqst() by returning
-ERESTARTSYS.  If it can't, it will return -EINTR anyway.
