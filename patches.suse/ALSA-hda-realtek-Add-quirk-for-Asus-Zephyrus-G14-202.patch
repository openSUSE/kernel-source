Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/realtek: Add quirk for Asus Zephyrus G14 2025 using CS35L56, fix speakers
Git-commit: cbd46cbc5470f9cb0bbeff70561a3dd3e0769fe1
Patch-mainline: v6.19-rc6
References: jsc#PED-14430 jsc#PED-14297 jsc#PED-14024

Just like GA403U, this GA403W needs to remap woofers to DAC1. Similarly to
other Asus devices, headphones/headset MIC is not working, however the pin
config alone is not enough to fix it.

From Windows dump of GA403W:
  0x12, 0x90a60140 # Correctly set by codec out of the box
  0x13, 0x90a60550
  0x14, 0x90170510
  0x17, 0x90170120 # Correctly set by codec out of the box
  0x19, 0x03a11050 # Set by ALC285_FIXUP_ASUS_GA403U_HEADSET_MIC
  0x1a, 0x411115F0
  0x1b, 0x03a11c30 # Set by ALC285_FIXUP_ASUS_GA403U_HEADSET_MIC
  0x1d, 0x40663A45 # Correctly set by codec out of the box
  0x21, 0x03211430

Even with all the values set, MIC of the jack is not detected. Until a
complete solution is found, set ALC285_FIXUP_ASUS_GA403U_HEADSET_MIC
for GA403W which fixes audio volume control for woofers. No need to
create new quirk with missing pin config just yet, since its not
making the situation better.
