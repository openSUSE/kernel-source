Subject: USB: change default delay time for usb-storage devices
Patch-mainline: 2.6.34-rc1
Git-commit: a4a47bc03fe520e95e0c4212bf97c86545fb14f9

This reduces the amount of time someone has to wait for a usb-storage
device to be usable from 5 seconds to 1 second.  Some very old and buggy
devices might still need the longer timeout, so they can change this
with the sysfs option.

Change made at the request of the desktop developers who were tired of
us taking longer than Windows for no good reason.
