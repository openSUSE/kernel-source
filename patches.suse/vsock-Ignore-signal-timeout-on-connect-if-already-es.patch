Subject: [PATCH] vsock: Ignore signal/timeout on connect() if already
 established

During connect(), acting on a signal/timeout by disconnecting an already
established socket leads to several issues:

1. connect() invoking vsock_transport_cancel_pkt() ->
   virtio_transport_purge_skbs() may race with sendmsg() invoking
   virtio_transport_get_credit(). This results in a permanently elevated
   `vvs->bytes_unsent`. Which, in turn, confuses the SOCK_LINGER handling.

2. connect() resetting a connected socket's state may race with socket
   being placed in a sockmap. A disconnected socket remaining in a sockmap
   breaks sockmap's assumptions. And gives rise to WARNs.

3. connect() transitioning SS_CONNECTED -> SS_UNCONNECTED allows for a
   transport change/drop after TCP_ESTABLISHED. Which poses a problem for
   any simultaneous sendmsg() or connect() and may result in a
   use-after-free/null-ptr-deref.

Do not disconnect socket on signal/timeout. Keep the logic for unconnected
sockets: they don't linger, can't be placed in a sockmap, are rejected by
sendmsg().
