Subject: drm/bridge: analogix_dp: Support PSR-exit to disable transition
Git-commit: ca871659ec1606d33b1e76de8d4cf924cf627e34
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc2
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

Most eDP panel functions only work correctly when the panel is not in
self-refresh. In particular, analogix_dp_bridge_disable() tends to hit
AUX channel errors if the panel is in self-refresh.

Given the above, it appears that so far, this driver assumes that we are
never in self-refresh when it comes time to fully disable the bridge.
Prior to commit 846c7dfc1193 ("drm/atomic: Try to preserve the crtc
enabled state in drm_atomic_remove_fb, v2."), this tended to be true,
because we would automatically disable the pipe when framebuffers were
removed, and so we'd typically disable the bridge shortly after the last
display activity.

However, that is not guaranteed: an idle (self-refresh) display pipe may
be disabled, e.g., when switching CRTCs. We need to exit PSR first.

Stable notes: this is definitely a bugfix, and the bug has likely
existed in some form for quite a while. It may predate the "PSR helpers"
refactor, but the code looked very different before that, and it's
probably not worth rewriting the fix.
