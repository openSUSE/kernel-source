Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: scan: Make acpi_bus_get_device() clear return pointer on error
Git-commit: 78a18fec5258c8df9435399a1ea022d73d3eceb9
Patch-mainline: v5.11-rc5
References: git-fixes

Set the acpi_device pointer which acpi_bus_get_device() returns-by-
reference to NULL on errors.

We've recently had 2 cases where callers of acpi_bus_get_device()
did not properly error check the return value, so set the returned-
by-reference acpi_device pointer to NULL, because at least some
callers of acpi_bus_get_device() expect that to be done on errors.

[ rjw: This issue was exposed by commit 71da201f38df ("ACPI: scan:
  Defer enumeration of devices with _DEP lists") which caused it to
  be much more likely to occur on some systems, but the real defect
  had been introduced by an earlier commit. ]

Fixes: 40e7fcb19293 ("ACPI: Add _DEP support to fix battery issue on Asus T100TA")
Fixes: bcfcd409d4db ("usb: split code locating ACPI companion into port and device")
