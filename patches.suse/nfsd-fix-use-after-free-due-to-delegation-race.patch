Subject: [PATCH] nfsd: fix use-after-free due to delegation race
Git-commit: 548ec0805c399c65ed66c6641be467f717833ab5
Patch-mainline: v5.16
References: git-fixes bsc#1225404 CVE-2021-47506

A delegation break could arrive as soon as we've called vfs_setlease.  A
delegation break runs a callback which immediately (in
nfsd4_cb_recall_prepare) adds the delegation to del_recall_lru.  If we
then exit nfs4_set_delegation without hashing the delegation, it will be
freed as soon as the callback is done with it, without ever being
removed from del_recall_lru.

Symptoms show up later as use-after-free or list corruption warnings,
usually in the laundromat thread.

I suspect aba2072f4523 "nfsd: grant read delegations to clients holding
writes" made this bug easier to hit, but I looked as far back as v3.0
and it looks to me it already had the same problem.  So I'm not sure
where the bug was introduced; it may have been there from the beginning.
