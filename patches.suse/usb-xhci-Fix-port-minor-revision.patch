Subject: [PATCH] usb: xhci: Fix port minor revision
Git-commit: 64364bc912c01b33bba6c22e3ccb849bfca96398
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc1
References: git-fixes

Some hosts incorrectly use sub-minor version for minor version (i.e.
0x02 instead of 0x20 for bcdUSB 0x320 and 0x01 for bcdUSB 0x310).
Currently the xHCI driver works around this by just checking for minor
revision > 0x01 for USB 3.1 everywhere. With the addition of USB 3.2,
checking this gets a bit cumbersome. Since there is no USB release with
bcdUSB 0x301 to 0x309, we can assume that sub-minor version 01 to 09 is
incorrect. Let's try to fix this and use the minor revision that matches
with the USB/xHCI spec to help with the version checking within the
driver.
