Subject: drm/plane: Extend damage tracking kernel-doc
Git-commit: 017bdf8fa20175b9cccbc746122256432a599845
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: drm-backport-placeholder

The "Damage Tracking Properties" section in the documentation doesn't have
info about the two type of damage handling: frame damage vs buffer damage.

Add it to the section and mention that helpers only support frame damage,
and how drivers handling buffer damage can indicate that the damage clips
should be ignored.

Also add references to further documentation about the two damage types.

+ * Only drivers handling frame damage can use the mentioned damage helpers to
+ * iterate over the damaged regions. Drivers that handle buffer damage, must set
+ * &drm_plane_state.ignore_damage_clips for drm_atomic_helper_damage_iter_init()
+ * to know that damage clips should be ignored and return &drm_plane_state.src
+ * as the damage rectangle, to force a full plane update.

+ * Drivers with a per-buffer upload target could compare the &drm_plane_state.fb
+ * of the old and new plane states to determine if the framebuffer attached to a
+ * plane has changed or not since the last plane update. If &drm_plane_state.fb
+ * has changed, then &drm_plane_state.ignore_damage_clips must be set to true.
+ *
+ * That is because drivers with a per-plane upload target, expect the backing

+ * between page flips, the new upload buffer has to be updated as a whole. This
+ * can be improved in the future if support for frame damage is added to the DRM
+ * damage helpers, similarly to how user-space already handle this case as it is
