Subject: scsi: libsas: Fix the failure of adding phy with zero-address to port
Git-commit: 06036a0a5db34642c5dbe22021a767141f010b7a
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc1
References: git-fixes

As of commit 7d1d86518118 ("[SCSI] libsas: fix false positive 'device
attached' conditions"), reset the phy->entacted_sas_addr address to a
zero-address when the link rate is less than 1.5G.

Currently we find that when a new device is attached, and the link rate is
less than 1.5G, but the device type is not NO_DEVICE, for example: the link
rate is SAS_PHY_RESET_IN_PROGRESS and the device type is stp. After setting
the phy->entacted_sas_addr address to the zero address, the port will
continue to be created for the phy with the zero-address, and other phys
with the zero-address will be tried to be added to the new port:

[562240.051197] sas: ex 500e004aaaaaaa1f phy19:U:0 attached: 0000000000000000 (no device)
// phy19 is deleted but still on the parent port's phy_list
[562240.062536] sas: ex 500e004aaaaaaa1f phy0 new device attached
[562240.062616] sas: ex 500e004aaaaaaa1f phy00:U:5 attached: 0000000000000000 (stp)
[562240.062680] port-7:7:0: trying to add phy phy-7:7:19 fails: it's already part of another port

Therefore, it should be the same as sas_get_phy_attached_dev(). Only when
device_type is SAS_PHY_UNUSED, sas_address is set to the 0 address.
