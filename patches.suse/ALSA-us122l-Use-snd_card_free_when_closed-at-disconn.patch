Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: us122l: Use snd_card_free_when_closed() at disconnection
Git-commit: b7df09bb348016943f56b09dcaafe221e3f73947
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
References: git-fixes CVE-2024-56532 bsc#1235059

The USB disconnect callback is supposed to be short and not too-long
waiting.  OTOH, the current code uses snd_card_free() at
disconnection, but this waits for the close of all used fds, hence it
can take long.  It eventually blocks the upper layer USB ioctls, which
may trigger a soft lockup.

An easy workaround is to replace snd_card_free() with
snd_card_free_when_closed().  This variant returns immediately while
the release of resources is done asynchronously by the card device
release at the last close.

The loop of us122l->mmap_count check is dropped as well.  The check is
useless for the asynchronous operation with *_when_closed().
