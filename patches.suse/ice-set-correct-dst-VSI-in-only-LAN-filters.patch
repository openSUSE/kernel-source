Subject: ice: set correct dst VSI in only LAN filters
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc3
Git-commit: 839e3f9bee425c90a0423d14b102a42fe6635c73
References: git-fixes

The filters set that will reproduce the problem:
$ tc filter add dev $VF0_PR ingress protocol arp prio 0 flower \
	skip_sw dst_mac ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff action mirred egress \
	redirect dev $PF0
$ tc filter add dev $VF0_PR ingress protocol arp prio 0 flower \
	skip_sw dst_mac ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff src_mac 52:54:00:00:00:10 \
	action mirred egress mirror dev $VF1_PR

Expected behaviour is to set all broadcast from VF0 to the LAN. If the
src_mac match the value from filters, send packet to LAN and to VF1.

In this case both LAN_EN and LB_EN flags in switch is set in case of
packet matching both filters. As dst VSI for the only LAN enable bit is
PF VSI, the packet is being seen on PF. To fix this change dst VSI to
the source VSI. It will block receiving any packet even when LB_EN is
set by switch, because local loopback is clear on VF VSI during normal
operation.

Side note: if the second filters action is redirect instead of mirror
LAN_EN is clear, because switch is AND-ing LAN_EN from each matched
filters and OR-ing LB_EN.
