Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda_codec: Replace zero-length array with flexible-array member
Git-commit: bb80b96422b443ddcb6dbb39261ea3e02a13661d
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: git-fixes

The current codebase makes use of the zero-length array language
extension to the C90 standard, but the preferred mechanism to declare
variable-length types such as these ones is a flexible array member[1][2],
introduced in C99:

struct foo {
        int stuff;
        struct boo array[];
};

By making use of the mechanism above, we will get a compiler warning
in case the flexible array does not occur last in the structure, which
will help us prevent some kind of undefined behavior bugs from being
inadvertenly introduced[3] to the codebase from now on.

This issue was found with the help of Coccinelle.
