Subject: scsi: lpfc: Simplify fcp_abort transport callback log message
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jejb/scsi.git
Git-commit: 1a5cd3d073ee3f27a83846deb956f023898830fa
References: bsc#1213756

The driver is reaching into a nvme_fc_cmd_iu ptr that belongs to the
transport during an abort.  This could cause an unintentional ptr
dereference into memory that the driver does not own.  Since the
nvme_fc_cmd_iu ptr was for logging purposes only, simplify the log message
such that the nvme_fc_cmd_iu reference is no longer needed.
