Subject: [PATCH] staging: rtl8192e: Fix incorrect source in memcpy()
Git-commit: 72ad25fbbb78930f892b191637359ab5b94b3190
Patch-mainline: v5.12-rc6
References: git-fixes

The variable "info_element" is of the following type:

	struct rtllib_info_element *info_element

defined in drivers/staging/rtl8192e/rtllib.h:

	struct rtllib_info_element {
		u8 id;
		u8 len;
		u8 data[];
	} __packed;

The "len" field defines the size of the "data[]" array. The code is
supposed to check if "info_element->len" is greater than 4 and later
equal to 6. If this is satisfied then, the last two bytes (the 4th and
5th element of u8 "data[]" array) are copied into "network->CcxRmState".

Right now the code uses "memcpy()" with the source as "&info_element[4]"
which would copy in wrong and unintended information. The struct
"rtllib_info_element" has a size of 2 bytes for "id" and "len",
therefore indexing will be done in interval of 2 bytes. So,
"info_element[4]" would point to data which is beyond the memory
allocated for this pointer (that is, at x+8, while "info_element" has
been allocated only from x to x+7 (2 + 6 => 8 bytes)).

This patch rectifies this error by using "&info_element->data[4]" which
correctly copies the last two bytes of "data[]".

Note: The faulty line of code came from the following commit:

commit ecdfa44610fa ("Staging: add Realtek 8192 PCI wireless driver")

The above commit created the file `rtl8192e/ieee80211/ieee80211_rx.c`
which had the faulty line of code. This file has been deleted (or
possibly renamed) with the contents copied in to a new file
`rtl8192e/rtllib_rx.c` along with additional code in the commit
94a799425eee (tagged in Fixes).
