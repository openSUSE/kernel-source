Subject: [PATCH 55/62] acpi: Ignore acpi_rsdp kernel param when the kernel has
 been locked down
Patch-mainline: No, submitted

References: fate#314486

This option allows userspace to pass the RSDP address to the kernel, which
makes it possible for a user to circumvent any restrictions imposed on
loading modules.  Ignore the option when the kernel is locked down.
