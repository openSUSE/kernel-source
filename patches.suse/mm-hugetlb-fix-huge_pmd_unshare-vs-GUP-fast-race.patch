Subject: [PATCH] mm/hugetlb: fix huge_pmd_unshare() vs GUP-fast race
Patch-mainline: v6.16-rc1
Git-commit: 1013af4f585fccc4d3e5c5824d174de2257f7d6d
References: bsc#1245431 CVE-2025-38085 bsc#1245499

huge_pmd_unshare() drops a reference on a page table that may have
previously been shared across processes, potentially turning it into a
normal page table used in another process in which unrelated VMAs can
afterwards be installed.

If this happens in the middle of a concurrent gup_fast(), gup_fast() could
end up walking the page tables of another process.  While I don't see any
way in which that immediately leads to kernel memory corruption, it is
really weird and unexpected.

Fix it with an explicit broadcast IPI through tlb_remove_table_sync_one(),
just like we do in khugepaged when removing page tables for a THP
collapse.
