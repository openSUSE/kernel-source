Subject: [PATCH] i2c: acpi: Unbind mux adapters before delete
Git-commit: 3f858bbf04dbac934ac279aaee05d49eb9910051
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc1
References: git-fixes CVE-2024-39362 bsc#1226995

There is an issue with ACPI overlay table removal specifically related
to I2C multiplexers.

Consider an ACPI SSDT Overlay that defines a PCA9548 I2C mux on an
existing I2C bus. When this table is loaded we see the creation of a
device for the overall PCA9548 chip and 8 further devices - one
i2c_adapter each for the mux channels. These are all bound to their
ACPI equivalents via an eventual invocation of acpi_bind_one().

When we unload the SSDT overlay we run into the problem. The ACPI
devices are deleted as normal via acpi_device_del_work_fn() and the
acpi_device_del_list.

However, the following warning and stack trace is output as the
deletion does not go smoothly:

repeated 7 more times, 1 for each channel of the mux
...

The issue is that the binding of the ACPI devices to their peer I2C
adapters is not correctly cleaned up. Digging deeper into the issue we
see that the deletion order is such that the ACPI devices matching the
mux channel i2c adapters are deleted first during the SSDT overlay
removal. For each of the channels we see a call to i2c_acpi_notify()
with ACPI_RECONFIG_DEVICE_REMOVE but, because these devices are not
actually i2c_clients, nothing is done for them.

Later on, after each of the mux channels has been dealt with, we come
to delete the i2c_client representing the PCA9548 device. This is the
call stack we see above, whereby the kernel cleans up the i2c_client
including destruction of the mux and its channel adapters. At this
point we do attempt to unbind from the ACPI peers but those peers no
longer exist and so we hit the kernfs errors.

The fix is to augment i2c_acpi_notify() to handle i2c_adapters. But,
given that the life cycle of the adapters is linked to the i2c_client,
instead of deleting the i2c_adapters during the i2c_acpi_notify(), we
just trigger unbinding of the ACPI device from the adapter device, and
allow the clean up of the adapter to continue in the way it always has.
