Subject: arm64: Ensure bits ASID[15:8] are masked out when the kernel uses
 8-bit ASIDs
Git-commit: c0900d15d31c2597dd9f634c8be2b71762199890
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc2
References: bsc#1234605

Linux currently sets the TCR_EL1.AS bit unconditionally during CPU
bring-up. On an 8-bit ASID CPU, this is RES0 and ignored, otherwise
16-bit ASIDs are enabled. However, if running in a VM and the hypervisor
reports 8-bit ASIDs (ID_AA64MMFR0_EL1.ASIDBits == 0) on a 16-bit ASIDs
CPU, Linux uses bits 8 to 63 as a generation number for tracking old
process ASIDs. The bottom 8 bits of this generation end up being written
to TTBR1_EL1 and also used for the ASID-based TLBI operations as the
upper 8 bits of the ASID. Following an ASID roll-over event we can have
threads of the same application with the same 8-bit ASID but different
generation numbers running on separate CPUs. Both TLB caching and the
TLBI operations will end up using different actual 16-bit ASIDs for the
same process.

A similar scenario can happen in a big.LITTLE configuration if the boot
CPU only uses 8-bit ASIDs while secondary CPUs have 16-bit ASIDs.

Ensure that the ASID generation is only tracked by bits 16 and up,
leaving bits 15:8 as 0 if the kernel uses 8-bit ASIDs. Note that
clearing TCR_EL1.AS is not sufficient since the architecture requires
that the top 8 bits of the ASID passed to TLBI instructions are 0 rather
than ignored in such configuration.
