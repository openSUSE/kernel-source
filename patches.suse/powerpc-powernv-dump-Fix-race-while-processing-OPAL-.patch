Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/powernv/dump: Fix race while processing OPAL dump

References: bsc#1065729
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc1
Git-commit: 0a43ae3e2beb77e3481d812834d33abe270768ab

Every dump reported by OPAL is exported to userspace through a sysfs
interface and notified using kobject_uevent(). The userspace daemon
(opal_errd) then reads the dump and acknowledges that the dump is
saved safely to disk. Once acknowledged the kernel removes the
respective sysfs file entry causing respective resources to be
released including kobject.

However it's possible the userspace daemon may already be scanning
dump entries when a new sysfs dump entry is created by the kernel.
User daemon may read this new entry and ack it even before kernel can
notify userspace about it through kobject_uevent() call. If that
happens then we have a potential race between
dump_ack_store->kobject_put() and kobject_uevent which can lead to
use-after-free of a kernfs object resulting in a kernel crash.

This patch fixes this race by protecting the sysfs file
creation/notification by holding a reference count on kobject until we
safely send kobject_uevent().

The function create_dump_obj() returns the dump object which if used
by caller function will end up in use-after-free problem again.
However, the return value of create_dump_obj() function isn't being
used today and there is no need as well. Hence change it to return
void to make this fix complete.
