Subject: [PATCH] hugetlb: fix hugetlb cgroup refcounting during vma split

References: bsc#1190208 (MM functional and performance backports) stable-5.14.6
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
Git-commit: 09a26e832705fdb7a9484495b71a05e0bbc65207

Guillaume Morin reported hitting the following WARNING followed by GPF or
NULL pointer deference either in cgroups_destroy or in the kill_css path.:

    percpu ref (css_release) <= 0 (-1) after switching to atomic
    WARNING: CPU: 23 PID: 130 at lib/percpu-refcount.c:196 percpu_ref_switch_to_atomic_rcu+0x127/0x130

Upon further examination, it was discovered that the css structure was
associated with hugetlb reservations.

For private hugetlb mappings the vma points to a reserve map that
contains a pointer to the css.  At mmap time, reservations are set up
and a reference to the css is taken.  This reference is dropped in the
vma close operation; hugetlb_vm_op_close.  However, if a vma is split no
additional reference to the css is taken yet hugetlb_vm_op_close will be
called twice for the split vma resulting in an underflow.

Fix by taking another reference in hugetlb_vm_op_open.  Note that the
reference is only taken for the owner of the reserve map.  In the more
common fork case, the pointer to the reserve map is cleared for
non-owning vmas.
