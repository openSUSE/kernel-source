Subject: [PATCH] sched/fair: Use candidate prev/recent_used CPU if scanning
 failed for cluster wakeup

References: bsc#1184587, bsc#1212887 (Scheduler functional and performance backports)
Git-commit: 22165f61d0c4092adf40f967c899e5d8b8a0d703
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1

Chen Yu reports a hackbench regression of cluster wakeup when
hackbench threads equal to the CPU number [1]. Analysis shows
it's because we wake up more on the target CPU even if the
prev_cpu is a good wakeup candidate and leads to the decrease
of the CPU utilization.

Generally if the task's prev_cpu is idle we'll wake up the task
on it without scanning. On cluster machines we'll try to wake up
the task in the same cluster of the target for better cache
affinity, so if the prev_cpu is idle but not sharing the same
cluster with the target we'll still try to find an idle CPU within
the cluster. This will improve the performance at low loads on
cluster machines. But in the issue above, if the prev_cpu is idle
but not in the cluster with the target CPU, we'll try to scan an
idle one in the cluster. But since the system is busy, we're
likely to fail the scanning and use target instead, even if
the prev_cpu is idle. Then leads to the regression.

This patch solves this in 2 steps:
o record the prev_cpu/recent_used_cpu if they're good wakeup
  candidates but not sharing the cluster with the target.
o on scanning failure use the prev_cpu/recent_used_cpu if
  they're recorded as idle
