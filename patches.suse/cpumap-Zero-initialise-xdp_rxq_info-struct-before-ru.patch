Subject: cpumap: Zero-initialise xdp_rxq_info struct before running XDP
 program

References: bsc#1224718 CVE-2024-27431

When running an XDP program that is attached to a cpumap entry, we don't
initialise the xdp_rxq_info data structure being used in the xdp_buff
that backs the XDP program invocation. Tobias noticed that this leads to
random values being returned as the xdp_md->rx_queue_index value for XDP
programs running in a cpumap.

This means we're basically returning the contents of the uninitialised
memory, which is bad. Fix this by zero-initialising the rxq data
structure before running the XDP program.
