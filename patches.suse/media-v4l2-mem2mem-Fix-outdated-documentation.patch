Subject: [PATCH] media: v4l2-mem2mem: Fix outdated documentation
Git-commit: 082b86919b7a94de01d849021b4da820a6cb89dc
Patch-mainline: v6.19-rc1
References: git-fixes

Commit cbd9463da1b1 ("media: v4l2-mem2mem: Avoid calling .device_run in
v4l2_m2m_job_finish") deferred calls to .device_run() to a work queue to
avoid recursive calls when a job is finished right away from
.device_run(). It failed to update the v4l2_m2m_job_finish()
documentation that still states the function must not be called from
.device_run(). Fix it.
