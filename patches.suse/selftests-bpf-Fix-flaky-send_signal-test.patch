Subject: [PATCH] selftests/bpf: Fix flaky send_signal test
Git-commit: b16ac5bf732a5e23d164cf908ec7742d6a6120d3
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: stable-5.14.6

[ Upstream commit b16ac5bf732a5e23d164cf908ec7742d6a6120d3 ]

libbpf CI has reported send_signal test is flaky although
I am not able to reproduce it in my local environment.
But I am able to reproduce with on-demand libbpf CI ([1]).

Through code analysis, the following is possible reason.
The failed subtest runs bpf program in softirq environment.
Since bpf_send_signal() only sends to a fork of "test_progs"
process. If the underlying current task is
not "test_progs", bpf_send_signal() will not be triggered
and the subtest will fail.

To reduce the chances where the underlying process is not
the intended one, this patch boosted scheduling priority to
-20 (highest allowed by setpriority() call). And I did
10 runs with on-demand libbpf CI with this patch and I
didn't observe any failures.
