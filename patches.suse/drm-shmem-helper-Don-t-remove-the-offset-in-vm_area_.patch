Subject: [PATCH] drm/shmem-helper: Don't remove the offset in vm_area_struct pgoff
Git-commit: 11d5a4745e00e73745774671dbf2fb07bd6e2363
Patch-mainline: v5.12-rc3
References: git-fixes

When mmapping the shmem, it would previously adjust the pgoff in the
vm_area_struct to remove the fake offset that is added to be able to
identify the buffer. This patch removes the adjustment and makes the
fault handler use the vm_fault address to calculate the page offset
instead. Although using this address is apparently discouraged, several
DRM drivers seem to be doing it anyway.

The problem with removing the pgoff is that it prevents
drm_vma_node_unmap from working because that searches the mapping tree
by address. That doesn't work because all of the mappings are at offset
0. drm_vma_node_unmap is being used by the shmem helpers when purging
the buffer.

This fixes a bug in Panfrost which is using drm_gem_shmem_purge. Without
this the mapping for the purged buffer can still be accessed which might
mean it would access random pages from other buffers

V2: Don't check whether the unsigned page_offset is less than 0.
