Subject: bpf: No need to simulate speculative domain for immediates
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
Git-repo: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
Git-commit: a7036191277f9fa68d92f2071ddc38c09b1e5ee5
References: bsc#1186484,CVE-2021-33200

In 801c6058d14a ("bpf: Fix leakage of uninitialized bpf stack under
speculation") we replaced masking logic with direct loads of immediates
if the register is a known constant. Given in this case we do not apply
any masking, there is also no reason for the operation to be truncated
under the speculative domain.

Therefore, there is also zero reason for the verifier to branch-off and
simulate this case, it only needs to do it for unknown but bounded scalars.
As a side-effect, this also enables few test cases that were previously
rejected due to simulation under zero truncation.
