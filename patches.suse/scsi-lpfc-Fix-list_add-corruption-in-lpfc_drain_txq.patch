Subject: scsi: lpfc: Fix list_add() corruption in lpfc_drain_txq()
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jejb/scsi.git
Git-commit: 99154581b05c8fb22607afb7c3d66c1bace6aa5d
References: bsc#1190576

When parsing the txq list in lpfc_drain_txq(), the driver attempts to pass
the requests to the adapter. If such an attempt fails, a local "fail_msg"
string is set and a log message output.  The job is then added to a
completions list for cancellation.

Processing of any further jobs from the txq list continues, but since
"fail_msg" remains set, jobs are added to the completions list regardless
of whether a wqe was passed to the adapter.  If successfully added to
txcmplq, jobs are added to both lists resulting in list corruption.

Fix by clearing the fail_msg string after adding a job to the completions
list. This stops the subsequent jobs from being added to the completions
list unless they had an appropriate failure.
