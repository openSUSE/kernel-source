Subject: netfilter: nft_set_hash: skip duplicated elements pending gc run
Git-commit: 7ffc7481153bbabf3332c6a19b289730c7e1edf5
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc2
References: CVE-2023-52923 bsc#1236104

rhashtable does not provide stable walk, duplicated elements are
possible in case of resizing. I considered that checking for errors when
calling rhashtable_walk_next() was sufficient to detect the resizing.
However, rhashtable_walk_next() returns -EAGAIN only at the end of the
iteration, which is too late, because a gc work containing duplicated
elements could have been already scheduled for removal to the worker.

Add a u32 gc worker sequence number per set, bump it on every workqueue
run. Annotate gc worker sequence number on the expired element. Use it
to skip those already seen in this gc workqueue run.

Note that this new field is never reset in case gc transaction fails, so
next gc worker run on the expired element overrides it. Wraparound of gc
worker sequence number should not be an issue with stale gc worker
sequence number in the element, that would just postpone the element
removal in one gc run.

Note that it is not possible to use flags to annotate that element is
pending gc run to detect duplicates, given that gc transaction can be
invalidated in case of update from the control plane, therefore, not
allowing to clear such flag.

On x86_64, pahole reports no changes in the size of nft_rhash_elem.
