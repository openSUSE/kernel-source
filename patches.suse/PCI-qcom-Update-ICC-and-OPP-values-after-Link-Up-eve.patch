4581403f6792 ("PCI: qcom: Enumerate endpoints based on Link up event in
'global_irq' interrupt") added the Link Up-based enumeration support, but
did not update the ICC/OPP vote once link is up. Before that, the update
happened during probe and the endpoints may or may not be enumerated at
that time, so the ICC/OPP vote was not guaranteed to be accurate.

With Link Up-based enumeration support, the driver can request the accurate
vote based on the PCIe link.

Call qcom_pcie_icc_opp_update() in qcom_pcie_global_irq_thread() after
enumerating the endpoints.
