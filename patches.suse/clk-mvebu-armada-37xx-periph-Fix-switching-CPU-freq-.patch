Subject: [PATCH] clk: mvebu: armada-37xx-periph: Fix switching CPU freq from 250 Mhz to 1 GHz

Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc1
References: git-fixes

It was observed that the workaround introduced by commit 61c40f35f5cd
("clk: mvebu: armada-37xx-periph: Fix switching CPU rate from 300Mhz to
1.2GHz") when base CPU frequency is 1.2 GHz is also required when base
CPU frequency is 1 GHz. Otherwise switching CPU frequency directly from
L2 (250 MHz) to L0 (1 GHz) causes a crash.

When base CPU frequency is just 800 MHz no crashed were observed during
switch from L2 to L0.
