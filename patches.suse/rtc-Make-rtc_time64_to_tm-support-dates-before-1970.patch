Subject: [PATCH] rtc: Make rtc_time64_to_tm() support dates before 1970
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-transfer-encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: 7df4cfef8b351fec3156160bedfc7d6d29de4cce
Patch-mainline: v6.16-rc1
References: stable-fixes

Conversion of dates before 1970 is still relevant today because these
dates are reused on some hardwares to store dates bigger than the
maximal date that is representable in the device's native format.
This prominently and very soon affects the hardware covered by the
rtc-mt6397 driver that can only natively store dates in the interval
1900-01-01 up to 2027-12-31. So to store the date 2028-01-01 00:00:00
to such a device, rtc_time64_to_tm() must do the right thing for
time=-2208988800.
