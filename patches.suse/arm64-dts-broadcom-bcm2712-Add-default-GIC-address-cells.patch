Subject: arm64: dts: broadcom: bcm2712: Add default GIC address cells
Git-commit: 278b6cabf18bd804f956b98a2f1068717acdbfe3
Patch-mainline: v6.18-rc1
References: git-fixes

Add missing address-cells 0 to GIC interrupt node to silence W=1
warning:

  bcm2712.dtsi:494.4-497.31: Warning (interrupt_map): /axi/pcie@1000110000:interrupt-map:
    Missing property '#address-cells' in node /soc@107c000000/interrupt-controller@7fff9000, using 0 as fallback

Value '0' is correct because:
1. GIC interrupt controller does not have children,
2. interrupt-map property (in PCI node) consists of five components and
   the fourth component "parent unit address", which size is defined by
   '#address-cells' of the node pointed to by the interrupt-parent
   component, is not used (=0)
