Currently this has no practial relevance I think because there's not
many who can pull off a setup with panfrost and another gpu in the
same system. But the rules are that if you're setting an exclusive
fence, indicating a gpu write access in the implicit fencing system,
then you need to wait for all fences, not just the previous exclusive
fence.

panfrost against itself has no problem, because it always sets the
exclusive fence (but that's probably something that will need to be
fixed for vulkan and/or multi-engine gpus, or you'll suffer badly).
Also no problem with that against display.

With the prep work done to switch over to the dependency helpers this
is now a oneliner.
