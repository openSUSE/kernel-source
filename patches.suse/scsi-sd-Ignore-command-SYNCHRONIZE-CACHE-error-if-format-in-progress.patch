Subject: scsi: sd: Ignore command SYNCHRONIZE CACHE error if format in
 progress
Git-commit: 4f9eedfa27ae5806ed10906bcceee7bae49c8941
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc6
References: git-fixes

If formatting a suspended disk (such as formatting with different DIF
type), the disk will be resuming first, and then the format command will
submit to the disk through SG_IO ioctl.

When the disk is processing the format command, the system does not
submit other commands to the disk. Therefore, the system attempts to
suspend the disk again and sends the SYNCHRONIZE CACHE command. However,
the SYNCHRONIZE CACHE command will fail because the disk is in the
formatting process. This will cause the runtime_status of the disk to
error and it is difficult for user to recover it. Error info like:

[  669.925325] sd 6:0:6:0: [sdg] Synchronizing SCSI cache
[  670.202371] sd 6:0:6:0: [sdg] Synchronize Cache(10) failed: Result: hostbyte=0x00 driverbyte=DRIVER_OK
[  670.216300] sd 6:0:6:0: [sdg] Sense Key : 0x2 [current]
[  670.221860] sd 6:0:6:0: [sdg] ASC=0x4 ASCQ=0x4

To solve the issue, ignore the error and return success/0 when format is
in progress.
