Subject: bpf: tcp: Recv() should return 0 when the peer socket is closed
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
Git-commit: 2c7269b231194aae23fb90ab65842573a91acbc9
References: bsc#1177028

If the peer is closed, we will never get more data, so
tcp_bpf_wait_data will get stuck forever. In case we passed
MSG_DONTWAIT to recv(), we get EAGAIN but we should actually get
0.

>From man 2 recv:

    RETURN VALUE

    When a stream socket peer has performed an orderly shutdown, the
    return value will be 0 (the traditional "end-of-file" return).

This patch makes tcp_bpf_wait_data always return 1 when the peer
socket has been shutdown. Either we have data available, and it would
have returned 1 anyway, or there isn't, in which case we'll call
tcp_recvmsg which does the right thing in this situation.
