Subject: [PATCH] PCI/PM: Skip resuming to D0 if device is disconnected

Patch-mainline: v6.18-rc1
References: stable-fixes

When a device is surprise-removed (e.g., due to a dock unplug), the PCI
core unconfigures all downstream devices and sets their error state to
pci_channel_io_perm_failure. This marks them as disconnected via
pci_dev_is_disconnected().

During device removal, the runtime PM framework may attempt to resume the
device to D0 via pm_runtime_get_sync(), which calls into pci_power_up().
Since the device is already disconnected, this resume attempt is
unnecessary and results in a predictable errors like this, typically when
undocking from a TBT3 or USB4 dock with PCIe tunneling:

  pci 0000:01:00.0: Unable to change power state from D3cold to D0, device inaccessible

Avoid powering up disconnected devices by checking their status early in
pci_power_up() and returning -EIO.
