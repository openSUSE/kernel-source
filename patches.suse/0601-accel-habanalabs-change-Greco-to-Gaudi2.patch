Subject: accel/habanalabs: change Greco to Gaudi2
Git-commit: 26f5b6c364382803e4c29743bf8e9fd0de161190
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: drm-backport-placeholder jsc#PED-3527 jsc#PED-5475 jsc#PED-6068 jsc#PED-6070 jsc#PED-6116 jsc#PED-6120 jsc#PED-5065 jsc#PED-5477 jsc#PED-5511 jsc#PED-6041 jsc#PED-6069 jsc#PED-6071

Greco was not upstreamed so no point of mentioning it here.
