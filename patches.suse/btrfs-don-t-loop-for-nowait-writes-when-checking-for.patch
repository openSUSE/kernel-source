Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: don't loop for nowait writes when checking for cross
 references
Git-commit: ed67f2a913a4f0fc505db29805c41dd07d3cb356
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc2
References: git-fixes

When checking for delayed refs when verifying if there are cross
references for a data extent, we stop if the path has nowait set and we
can't try lock the delayed ref head's mutex, returning -EAGAIN with the
goal of making a write fallback to a blocking context. However we ignore
the -EAGAIN at btrfs_cross_ref_exist() when check_delayed_ref() returns
it, and keep looping instead of immediately returning the -EAGAIN to the
caller.

Fix this by not looping if we get -EAGAIN and we have a nowait path.

Fixes: 26ce91144631 ("btrfs: make can_nocow_extent nowait compatible")
