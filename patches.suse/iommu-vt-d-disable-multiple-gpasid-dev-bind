Subject: iommu/vt-d: Disable multiple GPASID-dev bind
Git-commit: d315e9e684d1efd4cb2e8cd70b8d71dec02fcf1f
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc1
References: bsc#1175713

For the unlikely use case where multiple aux domains from the same pdev
are attached to a single guest and then bound to a single process
(thus same PASID) within that guest, we cannot easily support this case
by refcounting the number of users. As there is only one SL page table
per PASID while we have multiple aux domains thus multiple SL page tables
for the same PASID.

Extra unbinding guest PASID can happen due to race between normal and
exception cases. Termination of one aux domain may affect others unless
we actively track and switch aux domains to ensure the validity of SL
page tables and TLB states in the shared PASID entry.

Support for sharing second level PGDs across domains can reduce the
complexity but this is not available due to the limitations on VFIO
container architecture. We can revisit this decision once sharing PGDs
are available.

Overall, the complexity and potential glitch do not warrant this unlikely
use case thereby removed by this patch.
