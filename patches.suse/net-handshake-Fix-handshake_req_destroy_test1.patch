Subject: net/handshake: Fix handshake_req_destroy_test1
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc5
Git-commit: 4e1d71cabb19ec2586827adfc60d68689c68c194
References: git-fixes CVE-2024-26831 bsc#1223008

Recently, handshake_req_destroy_test1 started failing:

Expected handshake_req_destroy_test == req, but
    handshake_req_destroy_test == 0000000000000000
    req == 0000000060f99b40
not ok 11 req_destroy works

This is because "sock_release(sock)" was replaced with "fput(filp)"
to address a memory leak. Note that sock_release() is synchronous
but fput() usually delays the final close and clean-up.

The delay is not consequential in the other cases that were changed
but handshake_req_destroy_test1 is testing that handshake_req_cancel()
followed by closing the file actually does call the ->hp_destroy
method. Thus the PTR_EQ test at the end has to be sure that the
final close is complete before it checks the pointer.

We cannot use a completion here because if ->hp_destroy is never
called (ie, there is an API bug) then the test will hang.
