Subject: drm/i915/guc: Refcount context during error capture
Git-commit: 08d1ecd98a8fe653d24644f072a87549e8503447
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

When i915 receives a context reset notification from GuC, it triggers
an error capture before resetting any outstanding requsts of that
context. Unfortunately, the error capture is not a time bound
operation. In certain situations it can take a long time, particularly
when multiple large LMEM buffers must be read back and eoncoded. If
this delay is longer than other timeouts (heartbeat, test recovery,
etc.) then a full GT reset can be triggered in the middle.

That can result in the context being reset by GuC actually being
destroyed before the error capture completes and the GuC submission
code resumes. Thus, the GuC side can start dereferencing stale
pointers and Bad Things ensue.

So add a refcount get of the context during the entire reset
operation. That way, the context can't be destroyed part way through
no matter what other resets or user interactions occur.

v2:
 (Matthew Brost)
  - Update patch to work with async error capture
v3:
 (Matthew Brost)
  - Drop async capture support as that hasn't landed yet
