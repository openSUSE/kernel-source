Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: stm32: sai: manage context in set_sysclk callback
Git-commit: 27fa1a8b2803dfd88c39f03b0969c55f667cdc43
Patch-mainline: v6.18-rc1
References: stable-fixes

The mclk direction now needs to be specified in endpoint node with
"system-clock-direction-out" property. However some calls to the
set_sysclk callback, related to CPU DAI clock, result in unbalanced
calls to clock API.
The set_sysclk callback in STM32 SAI driver is intended only for mclk
management. So it is relevant to ensure that calls to set_sysclk are
related to mclk only.
Since the master clock is handled only at runtime, skip the calls to
set_sysclk in the initialization phase.
