Subject: nvme-tcp: fix possible use-after-free in transport error_recovery
 work
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc3
Git-commit: ff9fc7ebf5c06de1ef72a69f9b1ab40af8b07f9e
References: git-fixes

While nvme_tcp_submit_async_event_work is checking the ctrl and queue
state before preparing the AER command and scheduling io_work, in order
to fully prevent a race where this check is not reliable the error
recovery work must flush async_event_work before continuing to destroy
the admin queue after setting the ctrl state to RESETTING such that
there is no race .submit_async_event and the error recovery handler
itself changing the ctrl state.
