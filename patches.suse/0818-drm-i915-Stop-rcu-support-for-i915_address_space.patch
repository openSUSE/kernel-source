The full audit is quite a bit of work:

- i915_dpt has very simple lifetime (somehow we create a display pagetable vm
  per object, so its _very_ simple, there's only ever a single vma in there),
  and uses i915_vm_close(), which internally does a i915_vm_put(). No rcu.

  Aside: wtf is i915_dpt doing in the intel_display.c garbage collector as a new
  feature, instead of added as a separate file with some clean-ish interface.

  Also, i915_dpt unfortunately re-introduces some coding patterns from
  pre-dma_resv_lock conversion times.

- i915_gem_proto_ctx is fully refcounted and no rcu, all protected by
  fpriv->proto_context_lock.

- i915_gem_context is itself rcu protected, and that might leak to anything it
  points at. Before

  those are gone now. The main one was removed even earlier with

  There doesn't seem to be anything left that's actually protecting
  stuff now that the ctx->vm itself is invariant. See

	    drm/i915/gem: Don't allow changing the VM on running contexts (v4)

  Note that we drop the vm refcount before the final release of the gem context
  refcount, so this is all very dangerous even without rcu. Note that aside from
  later on creating new engines (a defunct feature) and debug output we're never
  looked at gem_ctx->vm for anything functional, hence why this is ok.
  Fingers crossed.

  Preceeding patches removed all vestiges of rcu use from gem_ctx->vm
  derferencing to make it clear it's really not used.

  The gem_ctx->rcu protection was introduced in

	    drm/i915: Move context management under GEM

  The commit message is somewhat entertaining because it fails to
  mention this fact completely, and compensates that by an in-commit
  changelog entry that claims that ctx->vm is protected by ctx->mutex.
  Which was the case _before_ this commit, but no longer after it.

- intel_context holds a full reference. Unfortunately intel_context is also rcu
  protected and the reference to the ->vm is dropped before the
  rcu barrier - only the kfree is delayed. So again we need to check
  whether that leaks anywhere on the intel_context->vm. RCU is only
  used to protect intel_context sitting on the breadcrumb lists, which
  don't look at the vm anywhere, so we are fine.

  Nothing else relies on rcu protection of intel_context and hence is
  fully protected by the kref refcount alone, which protects
  intel_context->vm in turn.

  The breadcrumbs rcu usage was added in

	    drm/i915/gt: Protect context lifetime with RCU

  given some credence to my claim that I've actually caught them all.

- drm_i915_gem_object's shares_resv_from pointer has a full refcount to the
  dma_resv, which is a sub-refcount that's released after the final
  i915_vm_put() has been called. Safe.

  Aside: Maybe we should have a struct dma_resv_shared which is just dma_resv +
  kref as a stand-alone thing. It's a pretty useful pattern which other drivers
  might want to copy.

	    drm/i915: Don't free shared locks while shared

- the fpriv->vm_xa was relying on rcu_read_lock for lookup, but that
  was updated in a prep patch too to just be a spinlock-protected
  lookup.

- intel_gt->vm is set at driver load in intel_gt_init() and released
  in intel_gt_driver_release(). There seems to be some issue that
  in some error paths this is called twice, but otherwise no rcu to be
  found anywhere. This was added in the below commit, which
  unfortunately doesn't explain why this complication exists.

	    drm/i915: Remove i915->kernel_context

  The proper fix most likely for this is to start using drmm_ at large
  scale, but that's also huge amounts of work.

- i915_vma->vm is some real pain, because rcu is rcu protected, at
  least in the vma lookup in the context lookup cache in
  eb_lookup_vma(). This was added in

	    drm/i915/gem: Avoid gem_context->mutex for simple vma lookup

  the locking was changed from dev->struct_mutex to rcu, which added
  the requirement to rcu protect i915_vma. Somehow this was missed in
  review (or I'm completely blind).

  Irrespective of all that the vma lookup cache rcu_read_lock grabs a
  full reference of the vma and the rcu doesn't leak further. So no
  impact on i915_address_space from that.

  I have not found any other rcu use for i915_vma, but given that it
  seems broken I also didn't bother to do a careful in-depth audit.

Alltogether there's nothing left in-tree anymore which requires that a
pointer deref to an i915_address_space is safe undre rcu_read_lock
only.

rcu protection of i915_address_space was introduced in

    drm/i915/gtt: Defer address space cleanup to an RCU worker

by mixing up a bugfixing (i915_address_space needs to be released from
a worker) with enabling rcu support. The commit message also seems
somewhat confused, because it talks about cleanup of WC pages
requiring sleep, while the code and linked bugzilla are about a
requirement to take dev->struct_mutex (which yes sleeps but it's a
much more specific problem). Since final kref_put can be called from
pretty much anywhere (including hardirq context through the
scheduler's i915_active cleanup) we need a worker here. Hence that
part must be kept.

Ideally all these reclaim workers should have some kind of integration
with our shrinkers, but for some of these it's rather tricky. Anyway,
that's a preexisting condition in the codeebase that we wont fix in
this patch here.

We also remove the rcu_barrier in ggtt_cleanup_hw added in
