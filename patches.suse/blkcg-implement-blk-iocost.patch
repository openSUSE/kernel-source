Subject: [PATCH] blkcg: implement blk-iocost
References: bsc#1156419,jsc#SLE-8281
Git-commit: 7caa47151ab2e644dd221f741ec7578d9532c9a3
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1

This patchset implements IO cost model based work-conserving
proportional controller.

While io.latency provides the capability to comprehensively prioritize
and protect IOs depending on the cgroups, its protection is binary -
the lowest latency target cgroup which is suffering is protected at
the cost of all others.  In many use cases including stacking multiple
workload containers in a single system, it's necessary to distribute
IO capacity with better granularity.

One challenge of controlling IO resources is the lack of trivially
observable cost metric.  The most common metrics - bandwidth and iops
- can be off by orders of magnitude depending on the device type and
IO pattern.  However, the cost isn't a complete mystery.  Given
several key attributes, we can make fairly reliable predictions on how
expensive a given stream of IOs would be, at least compared to other
IO patterns.

The function which determines the cost of a given IO is the IO cost
model for the device.  This controller distributes IO capacity based
on the costs estimated by such model.  The more accurate the cost
model the better but the controller adapts based on IO completion
latency and as long as the relative costs across differents IO
patterns are consistent and sensible, it'll adapt to the actual
performance of the device.

Currently, the only implemented cost model is a simple linear one with
a few sets of default parameters for different classes of device.
This covers most common devices reasonably well.  All the
infrastructure to tune and add different cost models is already in
place and a later patch will also allow using bpf progs for cost
models.

Please see the top comment in blk-iocost.c and documentation for
more details.

v2: Rebased on top of RQ_ALLOC_TIME changes and folded in Rik's fix
    for a divide-by-zero bug in current_hweight() triggered by zero
    inuse_sum.

+  io.cost.qos
+	A read-write nested-keyed file with exists only on the root
+	cgroup.
+
+	This file configures the Quality of Service of the IO cost
+	model based controller (CONFIG_BLK_CGROUP_IOCOST) which
+	currently implements "io.weight" proportional control.  Lines
+	are keyed by $MAJ:$MIN device numbers and not ordered.  The
+	line for a given device is populated on the first write for
+	the device on "io.cost.qos" or "io.cost.model".  The following
+	nested keys are defined.
+
+	  ======	=====================================
+	  enable	Weight-based control enable
+	  ctrl		"auto" or "user"
+	  rpct		Read latency percentile    [0, 100]
+	  rlat		Read latency threshold
+	  wpct		Write latency percentile   [0, 100]
+	  wlat		Write latency threshold
+	  min		Minimum scaling percentage [1, 10000]
+	  max		Maximum scaling percentage [1, 10000]
+	  ======	=====================================
+
+	The controller is disabled by default and can be enabled by
+	setting "enable" to 1.  "rpct" and "wpct" parameters default
+	to zero and the controller uses internal device saturation
+	state to adjust the overall IO rate between "min" and "max".
+
+	When a better control quality is needed, latency QoS
+	parameters can be configured.  For example::
+
+	  8:16 enable=1 ctrl=auto rpct=95.00 rlat=75000 wpct=95.00 wlat=150000 min=50.00 max=150.0
+
+	shows that on sdb, the controller is enabled, will consider
+	the device saturated if the 95th percentile of read completion
+	latencies is above 75ms or write 150ms, and adjust the overall
+	IO issue rate between 50% and 150% accordingly.
+
+	The lower the saturation point, the better the latency QoS at
+	the cost of aggregate bandwidth.  The narrower the allowed
+	adjustment range between "min" and "max", the more conformant
+	to the cost model the IO behavior.  Note that the IO issue
+	base rate may be far off from 100% and setting "min" and "max"
+	blindly can lead to a significant loss of device capacity or
+	control quality.  "min" and "max" are useful for regulating
+	devices which show wide temporary behavior changes - e.g. a
+	ssd which accepts writes at the line speed for a while and
+	then completely stalls for multiple seconds.
+
+	When "ctrl" is "auto", the parameters are controlled by the
+	kernel and may change automatically.  Setting "ctrl" to "user"
+	or setting any of the percentile and latency parameters puts
+	it into "user" mode and disables the automatic changes.  The
+	automatic mode can be restored by setting "ctrl" to "auto".
+
+  io.cost.model
+	A read-write nested-keyed file with exists only on the root
+	cgroup.
+
+	This file configures the cost model of the IO cost model based
+	controller (CONFIG_BLK_CGROUP_IOCOST) which currently
+	implements "io.weight" proportional control.  Lines are keyed
+	by $MAJ:$MIN device numbers and not ordered.  The line for a
+	given device is populated on the first write for the device on
+	"io.cost.qos" or "io.cost.model".  The following nested keys
+	are defined.
+
+	  =====		================================
+	  ctrl		"auto" or "user"
+	  model		The cost model in use - "linear"
+	  =====		================================
+
+	When "ctrl" is "auto", the kernel may change all parameters
+	dynamically.  When "ctrl" is set to "user" or any other
+	parameters are written to, "ctrl" become "user" and the
+	automatic changes are disabled.
+
+	When "model" is "linear", the following model parameters are
+	defined.
+
+	  =============	========================================
+	  [r|w]bps	The maximum sequential IO throughput
+	  [r|w]seqiops	The maximum 4k sequential IOs per second
+	  [r|w]randiops	The maximum 4k random IOs per second
+	  =============	========================================
+
+	From the above, the builtin linear model determines the base
+	costs of a sequential and random IO and the cost coefficient
+	for the IO size.  While simple, this model can cover most
+	common device classes acceptably.
+
+	The IO cost model isn't expected to be accurate in absolute
+	sense and is scaled to the device behavior dynamically.

+ * One challenge of controlling IO resources is the lack of trivially
+ * observable cost metric.  This is distinguished from CPU and memory where
+ * wallclock time and the number of bytes can serve as accurate enough
+ * approximations.
+ *
+ * Bandwidth and iops are the most commonly used metrics for IO devices but
+ * depending on the type and specifics of the device, different IO patterns
+ * easily lead to multiple orders of magnitude variations rendering them
+ * useless for the purpose of IO capacity distribution.  While on-device
+ * time, with a lot of clutches, could serve as a useful approximation for
+ * non-queued rotational devices, this is no longer viable with modern
+ * devices, even the rotational ones.
+ *
+ * While there is no cost metric we can trivially observe, it isn't a
+ * complete mystery.  For example, on a rotational device, seek cost
+ * dominates while a contiguous transfer contributes a smaller amount
+ * proportional to the size.  If we can characterize at least the relative
+ * costs of these different types of IOs, it should be possible to
+ * implement a reasonable work-conserving proportional IO resource
+ * distribution.
+ *
+ * 1. IO Cost Model
+ *
+ * IO cost model estimates the cost of an IO given its basic parameters and
+ * history (e.g. the end sector of the last IO).  The cost is measured in
+ * device time.  If a given IO is estimated to cost 10ms, the device should
+ * be able to process ~100 of those IOs in a second.
+ *
+ * Currently, there's only one builtin cost model - linear.  Each IO is
+ * classified as sequential or random and given a base cost accordingly.
+ * On top of that, a size cost proportional to the length of the IO is
+ * added.  While simple, this model captures the operational
+ * characteristics of a wide varienty of devices well enough.  Default
+ * paramters for several different classes of devices are provided and the
+ * parameters can be configured from userspace via
+ * /sys/fs/cgroup/io.cost.model.
+ *
+ * If needed, tools/cgroup/iocost_coef_gen.py can be used to generate
+ * device-specific coefficients.
+ *
+ * 2. Control Strategy
+ *
+ * The device virtual time (vtime) is used as the primary control metric.
+ * The control strategy is composed of the following three parts.
+ *
+ * 2-1. Vtime Distribution
+ *
+ * When a cgroup becomes active in terms of IOs, its hierarchical share is
+ * calculated.  Please consider the following hierarchy where the numbers
+ * inside parentheses denote the configured weights.
+ *
+ *           root
+ *         /       \
+ *      A (w:100)  B (w:300)
+ *      /       \
+ *  A0 (w:100)  A1 (w:100)
+ *
+ * If B is idle and only A0 and A1 are actively issuing IOs, as the two are
+ * of equal weight, each gets 50% share.  If then B starts issuing IOs, B
+ * gets 300/(100+300) or 75% share, and A0 and A1 equally splits the rest,
+ * 12.5% each.  The distribution mechanism only cares about these flattened
+ * shares.  They're called hweights (hierarchical weights) and always add
+ * upto 1 (HWEIGHT_WHOLE).
+ *
+ * A given cgroup's vtime runs slower in inverse proportion to its hweight.
+ * For example, with 12.5% weight, A0's time runs 8 times slower (100/12.5)
+ * against the device vtime - an IO which takes 10ms on the underlying
+ * device is considered to take 80ms on A0.
+ *
+ * This constitutes the basis of IO capacity distribution.  Each cgroup's
+ * vtime is running at a rate determined by its hweight.  A cgroup tracks
+ * the vtime consumed by past IOs and can issue a new IO iff doing so
+ * wouldn't outrun the current device vtime.  Otherwise, the IO is
+ * suspended until the vtime has progressed enough to cover it.
+ *
+ * 2-2. Vrate Adjustment
+ *
+ * It's unrealistic to expect the cost model to be perfect.  There are too
+ * many devices and even on the same device the overall performance
+ * fluctuates depending on numerous factors such as IO mixture and device
+ * internal garbage collection.  The controller needs to adapt dynamically.
+ *
+ * This is achieved by adjusting the overall IO rate according to how busy
+ * the device is.  If the device becomes overloaded, we're sending down too
+ * many IOs and should generally slow down.  If there are waiting issuers
+ * but the device isn't saturated, we're issuing too few and should
+ * generally speed up.
+ *
+ * To slow down, we lower the vrate - the rate at which the device vtime
+ * passes compared to the wall clock.  For example, if the vtime is running
+ * at the vrate of 75%, all cgroups added up would only be able to issue
+ * 750ms worth of IOs per second, and vice-versa for speeding up.
+ *
+ * Device business is determined using two criteria - rq wait and
+ * completion latencies.
+ *
+ * When a device gets saturated, the on-device and then the request queues
+ * fill up and a bio which is ready to be issued has to wait for a request
+ * to become available.  When this delay becomes noticeable, it's a clear
+ * indication that the device is saturated and we lower the vrate.  This
+ * saturation signal is fairly conservative as it only triggers when both
+ * hardware and software queues are filled up, and is used as the default
+ * busy signal.
+ *
+ * As devices can have deep queues and be unfair in how the queued commands
+ * are executed, soley depending on rq wait may not result in satisfactory
+ * control quality.  For a better control quality, completion latency QoS
+ * parameters can be configured so that the device is considered saturated
+ * if N'th percentile completion latency rises above the set point.
+ *
+ * The completion latency requirements are a function of both the
+ * underlying device characteristics and the desired IO latency quality of
+ * service.  There is an inherent trade-off - the tighter the latency QoS,
+ * the higher the bandwidth lossage.  Latency QoS is disabled by default
+ * and can be set through /sys/fs/cgroup/io.cost.qos.
+ *
+ * 2-3. Work Conservation
+ *
+ * Imagine two cgroups A and B with equal weights.  A is issuing a small IO
+ * periodically while B is sending out enough parallel IOs to saturate the
+ * device on its own.  Let's say A's usage amounts to 100ms worth of IO
+ * cost per second, i.e., 10% of the device capacity.  The naive
+ * distribution of half and half would lead to 60% utilization of the
+ * device, a significant reduction in the total amount of work done
+ * compared to free-for-all competition.  This is too high a cost to pay
+ * for IO control.
+ *
+ * To conserve the total amount of work done, we keep track of how much
+ * each active cgroup is actually using and yield part of its weight if
+ * there are other cgroups which can make use of it.  In the above case,
+ * A's weight will be lowered so that it hovers above the actual usage and
+ * B would be able to use the rest.
+ *
+ * As we don't want to penalize a cgroup for donating its weight, the
+ * surplus weight adjustment factors in a margin and has an immediate
+ * snapback mechanism in case the cgroup needs more IO vtime for itself.
+ *
+ * Note that adjusting down surplus weights has the same effects as
+ * accelerating vtime for other cgroups and work conservation can also be
+ * implemented by adjusting vrate dynamically.  However, squaring who can
+ * donate and should take back how much requires hweight propagations
+ * anyway making it easier to implement and understand as a separate
+ * mechanism.
