Subject: ftrace: Do not blindly read the ip address in ftrace_bug()
Git-commit: 6c14133d2d3f768e0a35128faac8aa6ed4815051
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc6
References: git-fixes

It was reported that a bug on arm64 caused a bad ip address to be used for
updating into a nop in ftrace_init(), but the error path (rightfully)
returned -EINVAL and not -EFAULT, as the bug caused more than one error to
occur. But because -EINVAL was returned, the ftrace_bug() tried to report
what was at the location of the ip address, and read it directly. This
caused the machine to panic, as the ip was not pointing to a valid memory
address.

Instead, read the ip address with copy_from_kernel_nofault() to safely
access the memory, and if it faults, report that the address faulted,
otherwise report what was in that location.
