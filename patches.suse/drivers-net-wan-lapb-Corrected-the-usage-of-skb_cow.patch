Subject: [PATCH] drivers/net/wan: lapb: Corrected the usage of skb_cow
Git-commit: 8754e1379e7089516a449821f88e1fe1ebbae5e1
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc7
References: git-fixes

This patch fixed 2 issues with the usage of skb_cow in LAPB drivers
"lapbether" and "hdlc_x25":

1) After skb_cow fails, kfree_skb should be called to drop a reference
to the skb. But in both drivers, kfree_skb is not called.

2) skb_cow should be called before skb_push so that is can ensure the
safety of skb_push. But in "lapbether", it is incorrectly called after
skb_push.

More details about these 2 issues:

1) The behavior of calling kfree_skb on failure is also the behavior of
netif_rx, which is called by this function with "return netif_rx(skb);".
So this function should follow this behavior, too.

2) In "lapbether", skb_cow is called after skb_push. This results in 2
logical issues:
   a) skb_push is not protected by skb_cow;
   b) An extra headroom of 1 byte is ensured after skb_push. This extra
      headroom has no use in this function. It also has no use in the
      upper-layer function that this function passes the skb to
      (x25_lapb_receive_frame in net/x25/x25_dev.c).
So logically skb_cow should instead be called before skb_push.
