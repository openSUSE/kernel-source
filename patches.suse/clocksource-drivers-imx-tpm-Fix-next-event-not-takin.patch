Subject: [PATCH] clocksource/drivers/imx-tpm: Fix next event not taking effect sometime
Git-commit: 3d5c2f8e75a55cfb11a85086c71996af0354a1fb
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc7
References: git-fixes

The value written into the TPM CnV can only be updated into the hardware
when the counter increases. Additional writes to the CnV write buffer are
ignored until the register has been updated. Therefore, we need to check
if the CnV has been updated before continuing. This may require waiting for
1 counter cycle in the worst case.
