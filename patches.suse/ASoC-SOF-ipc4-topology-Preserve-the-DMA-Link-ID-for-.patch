Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: SOF: ipc4-topology: Preserve the DMA Link ID for ChainDMA on unprepare
Git-commit: e6fc5fcaeffa04a3fa1db8dfccdfd4b6001c0446
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
References: git-fixes

The DMA Link ID is set to the IPC message's primary during dai_config,
which is only during hw_params.
During xrun handling the hw_params is not called and the DMA Link ID
information will be lost.

All other fields in the message expected to be 0 for re-configuration, only
the DMA Link ID needs to be preserved and the in case of repeated
dai_config, it is correctly updated (masked and then set).
