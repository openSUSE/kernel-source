Subject: [PATCH] drm/nouveau: replace snprintf() with scnprintf() in nvkm_snprintbf()
Git-commit: 6510b62fe9303aaf48ff136ff69186bcfc32172d
Patch-mainline: v6.18-rc1
References: stable-fixes

snprintf() returns the number of characters that *would* have been
written, which can overestimate how much you actually wrote to the
buffer in case of truncation. That leads to 'data += this' advancing
the pointer past the end of the buffer and size going negative.

Switching to scnprintf() prevents potential buffer overflows and ensures
consistent behavior when building the output string.
