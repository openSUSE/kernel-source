and update the main GuC submission section with the new interface
details.

 - Drop guc_active.lock DOC
v3:
 - Fixup a few kernel doc comments (Daniele)

 /**
  * DOC: GuC-based command submission
  *
- * IMPORTANT NOTE: GuC submission is currently not supported in i915. The GuC
- * firmware is moving to an updated submission interface and we plan to
- * turn submission back on when that lands. The below documentation (and related
- * code) matches the old submission model and will be updated as part of the
- * upgrade to the new flow.
- *
- * GuC stage descriptor:
- * During initialization, the driver allocates a static pool of 1024 such
- * descriptors, and shares them with the GuC. Currently, we only use one
- * descriptor. This stage descriptor lets the GuC know about the workqueue and
- * process descriptor. Theoretically, it also lets the GuC know about our HW
- * contexts (context ID, etc...), but we actually employ a kind of submission
- * where the GuC uses the LRCA sent via the work item instead. This is called
- * a "proxy" submission.
- *
  * The Scratch registers:
  * There are 16 MMIO-based registers start from 0xC180. The kernel driver writes
  * a value to the action register (SOFT_SCRATCH_0) along with any data. It then
@@ -51,14 +36,85 @@
  * processes the request. The kernel driver polls waiting for this update and
  * then proceeds.
  *
- * Work Items:
- * There are several types of work items that the host may place into a
- * workqueue, each with its own requirements and limitations. Currently only
- * WQ_TYPE_INORDER is needed to support legacy submission via GuC, which
- * represents in-order queue. The kernel driver packs ring tail pointer and an
- * ELSP context descriptor dword into Work Item.
- * See guc_add_request()
+ * Command Transport buffers (CTBs):
+ * Covered in detail in other sections but CTBs (Host to GuC - H2G, GuC to Host
+ * - G2H) are a message interface between the i915 and GuC.
+ *
+ * Context registration:
+ * Before a context can be submitted it must be registered with the GuC via a
+ * H2G. A unique guc_id is associated with each context. The context is either
+ * registered at request creation time (normal operation) or at submission time
+ * (abnormal operation, e.g. after a reset).
+ *
+ * Context submission:
+ * The i915 updates the LRC tail value in memory. The i915 must enable the
+ * scheduling of the context within the GuC for the GuC to actually consider it.
+ * Therefore, the first time a disabled context is submitted we use a schedule
+ * enable H2G, while follow up submissions are done via the context submit H2G,
+ * which informs the GuC that a previously enabled context has new work
+ * available.
+ *
+ * Context unpin:
+ * To unpin a context a H2G is used to disable scheduling. When the
+ * corresponding G2H returns indicating the scheduling disable operation has
+ * completed it is safe to unpin the context. While a disable is in flight it
+ * isn't safe to resubmit the context so a fence is used to stall all future
+ * requests of that context until the G2H is returned.
+ *
+ * Context deregistration:
+ * Before a context can be destroyed or if we steal its guc_id we must
+ * deregister the context with the GuC via H2G. If stealing the guc_id it isn't
+ * safe to submit anything to this guc_id until the deregister completes so a
+ * fence is used to stall all requests associated with this guc_id until the
+ * corresponding G2H returns indicating the guc_id has been deregistered.
+ *
+ * guc_ids:
+ * Unique number associated with private GuC context data passed in during
+ * context registration / submission / deregistration. 64k available. Simple ida
+ * is used for allocation.
+ *
+ * Stealing guc_ids:
+ * If no guc_ids are available they can be stolen from another context at
+ * request creation time if that context is unpinned. If a guc_id can't be found
+ * we punt this problem to the user as we believe this is near impossible to hit
+ * during normal use cases.
+ *
+ * Locking:
+ * In the GuC submission code we have 3 basic spin locks which protect
+ * everything. Details about each below.
+ *
+ * sched_engine->lock
+ * This is the submission lock for all contexts that share an i915 schedule
+ * engine (sched_engine), thus only one of the contexts which share a
+ * sched_engine can be submitting at a time. Currently only one sched_engine is
+ * used for all of GuC submission but that could change in the future.
+ *
+ * guc->contexts_lock
+ * Protects guc_id allocation for the given GuC, i.e. only one context can be
+ * doing guc_id allocation operations at a time for each GuC in the system.
+ *
+ * ce->guc_state.lock
+ * Protects everything under ce->guc_state. Ensures that a context is in the
+ * correct state before issuing a H2G. e.g. We don't issue a schedule disable
+ * on a disabled context (bad idea), we don't issue a schedule enable when a
+ * schedule disable is in flight, etc... Also protects list of inflight requests
+ * on the context and the priority management state. Lock is individual to each
+ * context.
+ *
+ * Lock ordering rules:
+ * sched_engine->lock -> ce->guc_state.lock
+ * guc->contexts_lock -> ce->guc_state.lock
  *
+ * Reset races:
+ * When a full GT reset is triggered it is assumed that some G2H responses to
+ * H2Gs can be lost as the GuC is also reset. Losing these G2H can prove to be
+ * fatal as we do certain operations upon receiving a G2H (e.g. destroy
+ * contexts, release guc_ids, etc...). When this occurs we can scrub the
+ * context state and cleanup appropriately, however this is quite racey.
+ * To avoid races, the reset code must disable submission before scrubbing for
+ * the missing G2H, while the submission code must check for submission being
+ * disabled and skip sending H2Gs and updating context states when it is. Both
+ * sides must also make sure to hold the relevant locks.
