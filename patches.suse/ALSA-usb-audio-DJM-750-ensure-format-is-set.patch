Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: usb-audio: DJM-750: ensure format is set
Git-commit: e7df7df5a3809d733888db6ce6592a644acaac19
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc1
References: git-fixes

Add case statement to set sample-rate for the DJM-750 Pioneer
mixer. This was included as part of another patch but I think it has
been archived on Patchwork and hasn't been merged.
