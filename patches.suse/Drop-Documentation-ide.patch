- *                         CDROMREADRAW, since many drives don't support
- *                         MODE2 (even though ATAPI 2.6 says they must).
- *                      - Added ignore parameter to ide-cd (as a module), eg

- *			- report 1 slot for non-changers, like the other
- *			  cd-rom drivers. don't report select disc for
- *			  non-changers as well.
- *			- mask out audio playing, if the device can't do it.
- *
- * 4.55  Sep 1, 1999	- Eliminated the rest of the audio ioctls, except

-/*
- * Many thanks to Lode Leroy <Lode.Leroy@www.ibase.be>, who tested so many
- * ALPHA patches to this driver on an EASYSTOR LS-120 ATAPI floppy drive.
- *
- * Ver 0.1   Oct 17 96   Initial test version, mostly based on ide-tape.c.
- * Ver 0.2   Oct 31 96   Minor changes.
- * Ver 0.3   Dec  2 96   Fixed error recovery bug.
- * Ver 0.4   Jan 26 97   Add support for the HDIO_GETGEO ioctl.
- * Ver 0.5   Feb 21 97   Add partitions support.
- *                       Use the minimum of the LBA and CHS capacities.
- *                       Avoid hwgroup->rq == NULL on the last irq.
- *                       Fix potential null dereferencing with DEBUG_LOG.
- * Ver 0.8   Dec  7 97   Increase irq timeout from 10 to 50 seconds.
- *                       Add media write-protect detection.
- *                       Issue START command only if TEST UNIT READY fails.
- *                       Add work-around for IOMEGA ZIP revision 21.D.
- *                       Remove idefloppy_get_capabilities().
- * Ver 0.9   Jul  4 99   Fix a bug which might have caused the number of
- *                        bytes requested on each interrupt to be zero.
- *                        Thanks to <shanos@es.co.nz> for pointing this out.
- * Ver 0.9.sv Jan 6 01   Sam Varshavchik <mrsam@courier-mta.com>
- *                       Implement low level formatting.  Reimplemented
- *                       IDEFLOPPY_CAPABILITIES_PAGE, since we need the srfp
- *                       bit.  My LS-120 drive barfs on
- *                       IDEFLOPPY_CAPABILITIES_PAGE, but maybe it's just me.
- *                       Compromise by not reporting a failure to get this
- *                       mode page.  Implemented four IOCTLs in order to
- *                       implement formatting.  IOCTls begin with 0x4600,
- *                       0x46 is 'F' as in Format.
- *            Jan 9 01   Userland option to select format verify.
- *                       Added PC_SUPPRESS_ERROR flag - some idefloppy drives
- *                       do not implement IDEFLOPPY_CAPABILITIES_PAGE, and
- *                       return a sense error.  Suppress error reporting in
- *                       this particular case in order to avoid spurious
- *                       errors in syslog.  The culprit is
- *                       idefloppy_get_capability_page(), so move it to
- *                       idefloppy_begin_format() so that it's not used
- *                       unless absolutely necessary.
- *                       If drive does not support format progress indication
- *                       monitor the dsc bit in the status register.
- *                       Also, O_NDELAY on open will allow the device to be
- *                       opened without a disk available.  This can be used to
- *                       open an unformatted disk, or get the device capacity.
- * Ver 0.91  Dec 11 99   Added IOMEGA Clik! drive support by
- *     		   <paul@paulbristow.net>
- * Ver 0.92  Oct 22 00   Paul Bristow became official maintainer for this
- *           		   driver.  Included Powerbook internal zip kludge.
- * Ver 0.93  Oct 24 00   Fixed bugs for Clik! drive
- *                        no disk on insert and disk change now works
- * Ver 0.94  Oct 27 00   Tidied up to remove strstr(Clik) everywhere
- * Ver 0.95  Nov  7 00   Brought across to kernel 2.4
- * Ver 0.96  Jan  7 01   Actually in line with release version of 2.4.0
- *                       including set_bit patch from Rusty Russell
- * Ver 0.97  Jul 22 01   Merge 0.91-0.96 onto 0.9.sv for ac series
- * Ver 0.97.sv Aug 3 01  Backported from 2.4.7-ac3
- * Ver 0.98  Oct 26 01   Split idefloppy_transfer_pc into two pieces to
- *                        fix a lost interrupt problem. It appears the busy
- *                        bit was being deasserted by my IOMEGA ATAPI ZIP 100
- *                        drive before the drive was actually ready.
- * Ver 0.98a Oct 29 01   Expose delay value so we can play.
- * Ver 0.99  Feb 24 02   Remove duplicate code, modify clik! detection code
- *                        to support new PocketZip drives

- * Ver 0.1   Nov  1 95   Pre-working code :-)
- * Ver 0.2   Nov 23 95   A short backup (few megabytes) and restore procedure
- *                        was successful ! (Using tar cvf ... on the block
- *                        device interface).
- *                       A longer backup resulted in major swapping, bad
- *                        overall Linux performance and eventually failed as
- *                        we received non serial read-ahead requests from the
- *                        buffer cache.
- * Ver 0.3   Nov 28 95   Long backups are now possible, thanks to the
- *                        character device interface. Linux's responsiveness
- *                        and performance doesn't seem to be much affected
- *                        from the background backup procedure.
- *                       Some general mtio.h magnetic tape operations are
- *                        now supported by our character device. As a result,
- *                        popular tape utilities are starting to work with
- *                        ide tapes :-)
- *                       The following configurations were tested:
- *                       1. An IDE ATAPI TAPE shares the same interface
- *                        and irq with an IDE ATAPI CDROM.
- *                       2. An IDE ATAPI TAPE shares the same interface
- *                        and irq with a normal IDE disk.
- *                        Both configurations seemed to work just fine !
- *                        However, to be on the safe side, it is meanwhile
- *                        recommended to give the IDE TAPE its own interface
- *                        and irq.
- *                       The one thing which needs to be done here is to
- *                        add a "request postpone" feature to ide.c,
- *                        so that we won't have to wait for the tape to finish
- *                        performing a long media access (DSC) request (such
- *                        as a rewind) before we can access the other device
- *                        on the same interface. This effect doesn't disturb
- *                        normal operation most of the time because read/write
- *                        requests are relatively fast, and once we are
- *                        performing one tape r/w request, a lot of requests
- *                        from the other device can be queued and ide.c will
- *			  service all of them after this single tape request.
- * Ver 1.0   Dec 11 95   Integrated into Linux 1.3.46 development tree.
- *                       On each read / write request, we now ask the drive
- *                        if we can transfer a constant number of bytes
- *                        (a parameter of the drive) only to its buffers,
- *                        without causing actual media access. If we can't,
- *                        we just wait until we can by polling the DSC bit.
- *                        This ensures that while we are not transferring
- *                        more bytes than the constant referred to above, the
- *                        interrupt latency will not become too high and
- *                        we won't cause an interrupt timeout, as happened
- *                        occasionally in the previous version.
- *                       While polling for DSC, the current request is
- *                        postponed and ide.c is free to handle requests from
- *                        the other device. This is handled transparently to
- *                        ide.c. The hwgroup locking method which was used
- *                        in the previous version was removed.
- *                       Use of new general features which are provided by
- *                        ide.c for use with atapi devices.
- *                        (Programming done by Mark Lord)
- *                       Few potential bug fixes (Again, suggested by Mark)
- *                       Single character device data transfers are now
- *                        not limited in size, as they were before.
- *                       We are asking the tape about its recommended
- *                        transfer unit and send a larger data transfer
- *                        as several transfers of the above size.
- *                        For best results, use an integral number of this
- *                        basic unit (which is shown during driver
- *                        initialization). I will soon add an ioctl to get
- *                        this important parameter.
- *                       Our data transfer buffer is allocated on startup,
- *                        rather than before each data transfer. This should
- *                        ensure that we will indeed have a data buffer.
- * Ver 1.1   Dec 14 95   Fixed random problems which occurred when the tape
- *                        shared an interface with another device.
- *                        (poll_for_dsc was a complete mess).
- *                       Removed some old (non-active) code which had
- *                        to do with supporting buffer cache originated
- *                        requests.
- *                       The block device interface can now be opened, so
- *                        that general ide driver features like the unmask
- *                        interrupts flag can be selected with an ioctl.
- *                        This is the only use of the block device interface.
- *                       New fast pipelined operation mode (currently only on
- *                        writes). When using the pipelined mode, the
- *                        throughput can potentially reach the maximum
- *                        tape supported throughput, regardless of the
- *                        user backup program. On my tape drive, it sometimes
- *                        boosted performance by a factor of 2. Pipelined
- *                        mode is enabled by default, but since it has a few
- *                        downfalls as well, you may want to disable it.
- *                        A short explanation of the pipelined operation mode
- *                        is available below.
- * Ver 1.2   Jan  1 96   Eliminated pipelined mode race condition.
- *                       Added pipeline read mode. As a result, restores
- *                        are now as fast as backups.
- *                       Optimized shared interface behavior. The new behavior
- *                        typically results in better IDE bus efficiency and
- *                        higher tape throughput.
- *                       Pre-calculation of the expected read/write request
- *                        service time, based on the tape's parameters. In
- *                        the pipelined operation mode, this allows us to
- *                        adjust our polling frequency to a much lower value,
- *                        and thus to dramatically reduce our load on Linux,
- *                        without any decrease in performance.
- *                       Implemented additional mtio.h operations.
- *                       The recommended user block size is returned by
- *                        the MTIOCGET ioctl.
- *                       Additional minor changes.
- * Ver 1.3   Feb  9 96   Fixed pipelined read mode bug which prevented the
- *                        use of some block sizes during a restore procedure.
- *                       The character device interface will now present a
- *                        continuous view of the media - any mix of block sizes
- *                        during a backup/restore procedure is supported. The
- *                        driver will buffer the requests internally and
- *                        convert them to the tape's recommended transfer
- *                        unit, making performance almost independent of the
- *                        chosen user block size.
- *                       Some improvements in error recovery.
- *                       By cooperating with ide-dma.c, bus mastering DMA can
- *                        now sometimes be used with IDE tape drives as well.
- *                        Bus mastering DMA has the potential to dramatically
- *                        reduce the CPU's overhead when accessing the device,
- *                        and can be enabled by using hdparm -d1 on the tape's
- *                        block device interface. For more info, read the
- *                        comments in ide-dma.c.
- * Ver 1.4   Mar 13 96   Fixed serialize support.
- * Ver 1.5   Apr 12 96   Fixed shared interface operation, broken in 1.3.85.
- *                       Fixed pipelined read mode inefficiency.
- *                       Fixed nasty null dereferencing bug.
- * Ver 1.6   Aug 16 96   Fixed FPU usage in the driver.
- *                       Fixed end of media bug.
- * Ver 1.7   Sep 10 96   Minor changes for the CONNER CTT8000-A model.
- * Ver 1.8   Sep 26 96   Attempt to find a better balance between good
- *                        interactive response and high system throughput.
- * Ver 1.9   Nov  5 96   Automatically cross encountered filemarks rather
- *                        than requiring an explicit FSF command.
- *                       Abort pending requests at end of media.
- *                       MTTELL was sometimes returning incorrect results.
- *                       Return the real block size in the MTIOCGET ioctl.
- *                       Some error recovery bug fixes.
- * Ver 1.10  Nov  5 96   Major reorganization.
- *                       Reduced CPU overhead a bit by eliminating internal
- *                        bounce buffers.
- *                       Added module support.
- *                       Added multiple tape drives support.
- *                       Added partition support.
- *                       Rewrote DSC handling.

-===============================
-IDE ATAPI streaming tape driver
-===============================
-
-This driver is a part of the Linux ide driver.
-
-The driver, in co-operation with ide.c, basically traverses the
-request-list for the block device interface. The character device
-interface, on the other hand, creates new requests, adds them
-to the request-list of the block device, and waits for their completion.
-
-The block device major and minor numbers are determined from the
-tape's relative position in the ide interfaces, as explained in ide.c.
-
-The character device interface consists of the following devices::
-
-  ht0		major 37, minor 0	first  IDE tape, rewind on close.
-  ht1		major 37, minor 1	second IDE tape, rewind on close.
-  ...
-  nht0		major 37, minor 128	first  IDE tape, no rewind on close.
-  nht1		major 37, minor 129	second IDE tape, no rewind on close.
-  ...
-
-The general magnetic tape commands compatible interface, as defined by
-include/linux/mtio.h, is accessible through the character device.
-
-General ide driver configuration options, such as the interrupt-unmask
-flag, can be configured by issuing an ioctl to the block device interface,
-as any other ide device.
-
-Our own ide-tape ioctl's can be issued to either the block device or
-the character device interface.
-
-Maximal throughput with minimal bus load will usually be achieved in the
-following scenario:
-
-     1.	ide-tape is operating in the pipelined operation mode.
-     2.	No buffering is performed by the user backup program.
-
-Testing was done with a 2 GB CONNER CTMA 4000 IDE ATAPI Streaming Tape Drive.
-
-Here are some words from the first releases of hd.c, which are quoted
-in ide.c and apply here as well:
-
-* Special care is recommended.  Have Fun!
-
-Possible improvements
-=====================
-
-1. Support for the ATAPI overlap protocol.
-
-In order to maximize bus throughput, we currently use the DSC
-overlap method which enables ide.c to service requests from the
-other device while the tape is busy executing a command. The
-DSC overlap method involves polling the tape's status register
-for the DSC bit, and servicing the other device while the tape
-isn't ready.
-
-In the current QIC development standard (December 1995),
-it is recommended that new tape drives will *in addition*
-implement the ATAPI overlap protocol, which is used for the
-same purpose - efficient use of the IDE bus, but is interrupt
-driven and thus has much less CPU overhead.
-
-ATAPI overlap is likely to be supported in most new ATAPI
-devices, including new ATAPI cdroms, and thus provides us
-a method by which we can achieve higher throughput when
-sharing a (fast) ATA-2 disk with any (slow) new ATAPI device.

-============================================
-Information regarding the Enhanced IDE drive
-============================================
-
-   The hdparm utility can be used to control various IDE features on a
-   running system. It is packaged separately.  Please Look for it on popular
-   linux FTP sites.
-
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-.. important::
-
-   BUGGY IDE CHIPSETS CAN CORRUPT DATA!!
-
-    PCI versions of the CMD640 and RZ1000 interfaces are now detected
-    automatically at startup when PCI BIOS support is configured.
-
-    Linux disables the "prefetch" ("readahead") mode of the RZ1000
-    to prevent data corruption possible due to hardware design flaws.
-
-    For the CMD640, linux disables "IRQ unmasking" (hdparm -u1) on any
-    drive for which the "prefetch" mode of the CMD640 is turned on.
-    If "prefetch" is disabled (hdparm -p8), then "IRQ unmasking" can be
-    used again.
-
-    For the CMD640, linux disables "32bit I/O" (hdparm -c1) on any drive
-    for which the "prefetch" mode of the CMD640 is turned off.
-    If "prefetch" is enabled (hdparm -p9), then "32bit I/O" can be
-    used again.
-
-    The CMD640 is also used on some Vesa Local Bus (VLB) cards, and is *NOT*
-    automatically detected by Linux.  For safe, reliable operation with such
-    interfaces, one *MUST* use the "cmd640.probe_vlb" kernel option.
-
-    Use of the "serialize" option is no longer necessary.
-
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-Common pitfalls
-===============
-
-- 40-conductor IDE cables are capable of transferring data in DMA modes up to
-  udma2, but no faster.
-
-- If possible devices should be attached to separate channels if they are
-  available. Typically the disk on the first and CD-ROM on the second.
-
-- If you mix devices on the same cable, please consider using similar devices
-  in respect of the data transfer mode they support.
-
-- Even better try to stick to the same vendor and device type on the same
-  cable.
-
-This is the multiple IDE interface driver, as evolved from hd.c
-===============================================================
-
-It supports up to 9 IDE interfaces per default, on one or more IRQs (usually
-14 & 15).  There can be up to two drives per interface, as per the ATA-6 spec.::
-
-  Primary:    ide0, port 0x1f0; major=3;  hda is minor=0; hdb is minor=64
-  Secondary:  ide1, port 0x170; major=22; hdc is minor=0; hdd is minor=64
-  Tertiary:   ide2, port 0x1e8; major=33; hde is minor=0; hdf is minor=64
-  Quaternary: ide3, port 0x168; major=34; hdg is minor=0; hdh is minor=64
-  fifth..     ide4, usually PCI, probed
-  sixth..     ide5, usually PCI, probed
-
-To access devices on interfaces > ide0, device entries please make sure that
-device files for them are present in /dev.  If not, please create such
-entries, by using /dev/MAKEDEV.
-
-This driver automatically probes for most IDE interfaces (including all PCI
-ones), for the drives/geometries attached to those interfaces, and for the IRQ
-lines being used by the interfaces (normally 14, 15 for ide0/ide1).
-
-Any number of interfaces may share a single IRQ if necessary, at a slight
-performance penalty, whether on separate cards or a single VLB card.
-The IDE driver automatically detects and handles this.  However, this may
-or may not be harmful to your hardware.. two or more cards driving the same IRQ
-can potentially burn each other's bus driver, though in practice this
-seldom occurs.  Be careful, and if in doubt, don't do it!
-
-Drives are normally found by auto-probing and/or examining the CMOS/BIOS data.
-For really weird situations, the apparent (fdisk) geometry can also be specified
-on the kernel "command line" using LILO.  The format of such lines is::
-
-	ide_core.chs=[interface_number.device_number]:cyls,heads,sects
-
-or::
-
-	ide_core.cdrom=[interface_number.device_number]
-
-For example::
-
-	ide_core.chs=1.0:1050,32,64  ide_core.cdrom=1.1
-
-The results of successful auto-probing may override the physical geometry/irq
-specified, though the "original" geometry may be retained as the "logical"
-geometry for partitioning purposes (fdisk).
-
-If the auto-probing during boot time confuses a drive (ie. the drive works
-with hd.c but not with ide.c), then an command line option may be specified
-for each drive for which you'd like the drive to skip the hardware
-probe/identification sequence.  For example::
-
-	ide_core.noprobe=0.1
-
-or::
-
-	ide_core.chs=1.0:768,16,32
-	ide_core.noprobe=1.0
-
-Note that when only one IDE device is attached to an interface, it should be
-jumpered as "single" or "master", *not* "slave".  Many folks have had
-"trouble" with cdroms because of this requirement, so the driver now probes
-for both units, though success is more likely when the drive is jumpered
-correctly.
-
-Courtesy of Scott Snyder and others, the driver supports ATAPI cdrom drives
-such as the NEC-260 and the new MITSUMI triple/quad speed drives.
-Such drives will be identified at boot time, just like a hard disk.
-
-If for some reason your cdrom drive is *not* found at boot time, you can force
-the probe to look harder by supplying a kernel command line parameter
-via LILO, such as:::
-
-	ide_core.cdrom=1.0	/* "master" on second interface (hdc) */
-
-or::
-
-	ide_core.cdrom=1.1	/* "slave" on second interface (hdd) */
-
-For example, a GW2000 system might have a hard drive on the primary
-interface (/dev/hda) and an IDE cdrom drive on the secondary interface
-(/dev/hdc).  To mount a CD in the cdrom drive, one would use something like::
-
-	ln -sf /dev/hdc /dev/cdrom
-	mkdir /mnt/cdrom
-	mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom -t iso9660 -o ro
-
-If, after doing all of the above, mount doesn't work and you see
-errors from the driver (with dmesg) complaining about `status=0xff`,
-this means that the hardware is not responding to the driver's attempts
-to read it.  One of the following is probably the problem:
-
-  - Your hardware is broken.
-
-  - You are using the wrong address for the device, or you have the
-    drive jumpered wrong.  Review the configuration instructions above.
-
-  - Your IDE controller requires some nonstandard initialization sequence
-    before it will work properly.  If this is the case, there will often
-    be a separate MS-DOS driver just for the controller.  IDE interfaces
-    on sound cards usually fall into this category.  Such configurations
-    can often be made to work by first booting MS-DOS, loading the
-    appropriate drivers, and then warm-booting linux (without powering
-    off).  This can be automated using loadlin in the MS-DOS autoexec.
-
-If you always get timeout errors, interrupts from the drive are probably
-not making it to the host.  Check how you have the hardware jumpered
-and make sure it matches what the driver expects (see the configuration
-instructions above).  If you have a PCI system, also check the BIOS
-setup; I've had one report of a system which was shipped with IRQ 15
-disabled by the BIOS.
-
-The kernel is able to execute binaries directly off of the cdrom,
-provided it is mounted with the default block size of 1024 (as above).
-
-Please pass on any feedback on any of this stuff to the maintainer,
-whose address can be found in linux/MAINTAINERS.
-
-The IDE driver is modularized.  The high level disk/CD-ROM/tape/floppy
-drivers can always be compiled as loadable modules, the chipset drivers
-can only be compiled into the kernel, and the core code (ide.c) can be
-compiled as a loadable module provided no chipset support is needed.
-
-When using ide.c as a module in combination with kmod, add::
-
-	alias block-major-3 ide-probe
-
-to a configuration file in /etc/modprobe.d/.
-
-When ide.c is used as a module, you can pass command line parameters to the
-driver using the "options=" keyword to insmod, while replacing any ',' with
-';'.
-
-
-Summary of ide driver parameters for kernel command line
-========================================================
-
-For legacy IDE VLB host drivers (ali14xx/dtc2278/ht6560b/qd65xx/umc8672)
-you need to explicitly enable probing by using "probe" kernel parameter,
-i.e. to enable probing for ALI M14xx chipsets (ali14xx host driver) use:
-
-* "ali14xx.probe" boot option when ali14xx driver is built-in the kernel
-
-* "probe" module parameter when ali14xx driver is compiled as module
-  ("modprobe ali14xx probe")
-
-Also for legacy CMD640 host driver (cmd640) you need to use "probe_vlb"
-kernel paremeter to enable probing for VLB version of the chipset (PCI ones
-are detected automatically).
-
-You also need to use "probe" kernel parameter for ide-4drives driver
-(support for IDE generic chipset with four drives on one port).
-
-To enable support for IDE doublers on Amiga use "doubler" kernel parameter
-for gayle host driver (i.e. "gayle.doubler" if the driver is built-in).
-
-To force ignoring cable detection (this should be needed only if you're using
-short 40-wires cable which cannot be automatically detected - if this is not
-a case please report it as a bug instead) use "ignore_cable" kernel parameter:
-
-* "ide_core.ignore_cable=[interface_number]" boot option if IDE is built-in
-  (i.e. "ide_core.ignore_cable=1" to force ignoring cable for "ide1")
-
-* "ignore_cable=[interface_number]" module parameter (for ide_core module)
-  if IDE is compiled as module
-
-Other kernel parameters for ide_core are:
-
-* "nodma=[interface_number.device_number]" to disallow DMA for a device
-
-* "noflush=[interface_number.device_number]" to disable flush requests
-
-* "nohpa=[interface_number.device_number]" to disable Host Protected Area
-
-* "noprobe=[interface_number.device_number]" to skip probing
-
-* "nowerr=[interface_number.device_number]" to ignore the WRERR_STAT bit
-
-* "cdrom=[interface_number.device_number]" to force device as a CD-ROM
-
-* "chs=[interface_number.device_number]" to force device as a disk (using CHS)
-
-
-Some Terminology
-================
-
-IDE
-  Integrated Drive Electronics, meaning that each drive has a built-in
-  controller, which is why an "IDE interface card" is not a "controller card".
-
-ATA
-  AT (the old IBM 286 computer) Attachment Interface, a draft American
-  National Standard for connecting hard drives to PCs.  This is the official
-  name for "IDE".
-
-  The latest standards define some enhancements, known as the ATA-6 spec,
-  which grew out of vendor-specific "Enhanced IDE" (EIDE) implementations.
-
-ATAPI
-  ATA Packet Interface, a new protocol for controlling the drives,
-  similar to SCSI protocols, created at the same time as the ATA2 standard.
-  ATAPI is currently used for controlling CDROM, TAPE and FLOPPY (ZIP or
-  LS120/240) devices, removable R/W cartridges, and for high capacity hard disk
-  drives.

-IDE warm-plug HOWTO
-===================
-
-To warm-plug devices on a port 'idex'::
-
-	# echo -n "1" > /sys/class/ide_port/idex/delete_devices
-
-unplug old device(s) and plug new device(s)::
-
-	# echo -n "1" > /sys/class/ide_port/idex/scan
-
-done
-
-NOTE: please make sure that partitions are unmounted and that there are
-no other active references to devices before doing "delete_devices" step,
