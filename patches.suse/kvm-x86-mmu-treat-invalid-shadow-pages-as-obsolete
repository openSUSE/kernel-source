Subject: KVM: x86/mmu: Treat invalid shadow pages as obsolete
Git-commit: fac026dac0bc4dc3bb2e72309fa47ff3c4dd7c16
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: bsc#1164364

Treat invalid shadow pages as obsolete to fix a bug where an obsolete
and invalid page with a non-zero root count could become non-obsolete
due to mmu_valid_gen wrapping.  The bug is largely theoretical with the
current code base, as an unsigned long will effectively never wrap on
64-bit KVM, and userspace would have to deliberately stall a vCPU in
order to keep an obsolete invalid page on the active list while
simultaneously modifying memslots billions of times to trigger a wrap.

The obvious alternative is to use a 64-bit value for mmu_valid_gen,
but it's actually desirable to go in the opposite direction, i.e. using
a smaller 8-bit value to reduce KVM's memory footprint by 8 bytes per
shadow page, and relying on proper treatment of invalid pages instead of
preventing the generation from wrapping.

Note, "Fixes" points at a commit that was at one point reverted, but has
since been restored.
