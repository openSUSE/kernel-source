Christian reported a warning like the following obtained during running
some KVM-related tests on s390:

    ---[ end trace b035e7da5788eb09 ]---

The problem occurs because kmem_cache_destroy() is called immediately
after deleting of a memcg, so it races with the memcg kmem_cache
deactivation.

flush_memcg_workqueue() at the beginning of kmem_cache_destroy() is
supposed to guarantee that all deactivation processes are finished, but
failed to do so.  It waits for an rcu grace period, after which all
children kmem_caches should be deactivated.  During the deactivation
percpu_ref_kill() is called for non root kmem_cache refcounters, but it
requires yet another rcu grace period to finish the transition to the
atomic (dead) state.

So in a rare case when not all children kmem_caches are destroyed at the
moment when the root kmem_cache is about to be gone, we need to wait
another rcu grace period before destroying the root kmem_cache.

This issue can be triggered only with dynamically created kmem_caches
which are used with memcg accounting.  In this case per-memcg child
kmem_caches are created.  They are deactivated from the cgroup removing
path.  If the destruction of the root kmem_cache is racing with the
removal of the cgroup (both are quite complicated multi-stage
processes), the described issue can occur.  The only known way to
trigger it in the real life, is to unload some kernel module which
creates a dedicated kmem_cache, used from different memory cgroups with
GFP_ACCOUNT flag.  If the unloading happens immediately after calling
rmdir on the corresponding cgroup, there is some chance to trigger the
issue.
