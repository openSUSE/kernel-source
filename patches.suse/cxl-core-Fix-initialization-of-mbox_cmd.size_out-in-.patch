Subject: [PATCH] cxl/core: Fix initialization of mbox_cmd.size_out in get
 event
Git-commit: f7c52345ccc96343c0a05bdea3121c8ac7b67d5f
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc4
References: jsc#PED-10836

Since mbox_cmd.size_out is overwritten with the actual output size in
the function below, it needs to be initialized every time.

cxl_internal_send_cmd -> __cxl_pci_mbox_send_cmd

Problem scenario:

1) The size_out variable is initially set to the size of the mailbox.
2) Read an event.
   - size_out is set to 160 bytes(header 32B + one event 128B).
   - Two event are created while reading.
3) Read the new *two* events.
   - size_out is still set to 160 bytes.
   - Although the value of out_len is 288 bytes, only 160 bytes are
     copied from the mailbox register to the local variable.
   - record_count is set to 2.
   - Accessing records[1] will result in reading incorrect data.
