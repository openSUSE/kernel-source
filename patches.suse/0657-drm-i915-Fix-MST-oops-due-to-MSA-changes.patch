Subject: drm/i915: Fix MST oops due to MSA changes

Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: bsc#1152489

The MSA MISC computation now depends on the connector state, and
we do it from the DDI .pre_enable() hook. All that is fine for
DP SST but with MST we don't actually pass the connector state
to the dig port's .pre_enable() hook which leads to an oops.

Need to think more how to solve this in a cleaner fashion, but
for now let's just add a NULL check to stop the oopsing.
