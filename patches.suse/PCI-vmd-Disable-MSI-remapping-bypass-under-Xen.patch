Subject: [PATCH] PCI: vmd: Disable MSI remapping bypass under Xen

Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc1
References: stable-fixes

MSI remapping bypass (directly configuring MSI entries for devices on the
VMD bus) won't work under Xen, as Xen is not aware of devices in such bus,
and hence cannot configure the entries using the pIRQ interface in the PV
case, and in the PVH case traps won't be setup for MSI entries for such
devices.

Until Xen is aware of devices in the VMD bus prevent the
VMD_FEAT_CAN_BYPASS_MSI_REMAP capability from being used when running as
any kind of Xen guest.

The MSI remapping bypass is an optional feature of VMD bridges, and hence
when running under Xen it will be masked and devices will be forced to
redirect its interrupts from the VMD bridge.  That mode of operation must
always be supported by VMD bridges and works when Xen is not aware of
devices behind the VMD bridge.
