Subject: [PATCH] drm/nouveau/kms/nv140-: Disable interlacing
Git-commit: 8ba9249396bef37cb68be9e8dee7847f1737db9d
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc1
References: git-fixes

As it turns out: while Nvidia does actually have interlacing knobs on their
GPU still pretty much no current GPUs since Volta actually support it.
Trying interlacing on these GPUs will result in NVDisplay being quite
unhappy like so:

nouveau 0000:1f:00.0: disp: chid 0 stat 00004802 reason 4 [INVALID_ARG] mthd 2008 data 00000001 code 00080000
nouveau 0000:1f:00.0: disp: chid 0 stat 10005080 reason 5 [INVALID_STATE] mthd 0200 data 00000001 code 00000001

So let's fix this by following the same behavior Nvidia's driver does and
disable interlacing entirely.
