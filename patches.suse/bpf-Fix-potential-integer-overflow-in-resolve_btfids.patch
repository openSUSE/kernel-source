Subject: bpf: Fix potential integer overflow in resolve_btfids
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc2
Git-commit: 44382b3ed6b2787710c8ade06c0e97f5970a47c8
References: git-fixes

err is a 32-bit integer, but elf_update returns an off_t, which is 64-bit
at least on 64-bit platforms. If symbols_patch is called on a binary between
2-4GB in size, the result will be negative when cast to a 32-bit integer,
which the code assumes means an error occurred. This can wrongly trigger
build failures when building very large kernel images.
