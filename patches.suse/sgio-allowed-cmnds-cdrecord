Hello again,

as i get informed, that the kmail emailclient has not made
what i want, i decided to use mutt for next time. I will
include the patch again to make it readable. I have also
changed the thing with MODE_SELECT_10 to write mode 
because Christer Weinig figured out, that this CMD may
be insecure in connection with harddisks.
The changes to cdrom.h made by Marc Ballarin have not yet 
been included.
But i think, that the security model should made more 
precise - deciding only upon the commands does not give
the effekt of much improved security.

Here ist the patch.
