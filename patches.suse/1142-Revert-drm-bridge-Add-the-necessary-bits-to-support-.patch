Subject: Revert "drm/bridge: Add the necessary bits to support bus format
Git-commit: 3dfbf2d3d05eccb0d4ffb4f30467519e601a5db6
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-12680, jsc#SLE-12880, jsc#SLE-12882, jsc#SLE-12883, jsc#SLE-13496, jsc#SLE-15322
 negotiation"

This reverts commit e351e4d5eaec ("drm/bridge: Add the necessary bits
to support bus format negotiation"). Commit 6ed7e9625fa6 ("drm/bridge:
Add a drm_bridge_state object") introduced a circular dependency
between drm.ko and drm_kms_helper.ko which uncovered a misdesign in
how the whole thing was implemented. Let's revert all patches depending
on the bridge_state infrastructure for now.

- * This function is called by &drm_atomic_bridge_chain_check() just before
- * calling &drm_bridge_funcs.atomic_check() on all elements of the chain.
- * It performs bus format negotiation between bridge elements. The negotiation
- * happens in reverse order, starting from the last element in the chain up to
- * @bridge.
- *
- * Negotiation starts by retrieving supported output bus formats on the last
- * bridge element and testing them one by one. The test is recursive, meaning
- * that for each tested output format, the whole chain will be walked backward,
- * and each element will have to choose an input bus format that can be
- * transcoded to the requested output format. When a bridge element does not
- * support transcoding into a specific output format -ENOTSUPP is returned and
- * the next bridge element will have to try a different format. If none of the
- * combinations worked, -ENOTSUPP is returned and the atomic modeset will fail.
- *
- * This implementation is relying on
- * &drm_bridge_funcs.atomic_get_output_bus_fmts() and
- * &drm_bridge_funcs.atomic_get_input_bus_fmts() to gather supported
- * input/output formats.
- *
- * When &drm_bridge_funcs.atomic_get_output_bus_fmts() is not implemented by
- * the last element of the chain, &drm_atomic_bridge_chain_select_bus_fmts()
- * tries a single format: &drm_connector.display_info.bus_formats[0] if
- * available, MEDIA_BUS_FMT_FIXED otherwise.
- *
- * When &drm_bridge_funcs.atomic_get_input_bus_fmts() is not implemented,
- * &drm_atomic_bridge_chain_select_bus_fmts() skips the negotiation on the
- * bridge element that lacks this hook and asks the previous element in the
- * chain to try MEDIA_BUS_FMT_FIXED. It's up to bridge drivers to decide what
- * to do in that case (fail if they want to enforce bus format negotiation, or
- * provide a reasonable default if they need to support pipelines where not
- * all elements support bus format negotiation).
