Subject: overflow: Introduce __DEFINE_FLEX for having no initializer
Patch-mainline: v6.16-rc1
Git-commit: 5c78e793f78732b60276401f75cc1a101f9ad121
References: git-fixes

While not yet in the tree, there is a proposed patch[1] that was
depending on the prior behavior of _DEFINE_FLEX, which did not have an
explicit initializer. Provide this via __DEFINE_FLEX now, which can also
have attributes applied (e.g. __uninitialized).

Examples of the resulting initializer behaviors can be seen here:

Fixes: 47e36ed78406 ("overflow: Fix direct struct member initialization in _DEFINE_FLEX()")
