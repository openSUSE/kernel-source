Subject: irqchip/gic-v3: Warn about inconsistent implementations of extended
 ranges
Git-commit: ad5a78d3da81836c88d1f2d53310484462660997
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-14773

As is it usual for the GIC, it isn't disallowed to put together a system
that is majorly inconsistent, with a distributor supporting the
extended ranges while some of the CPUs don't.

Kindly tell the user that things are sailing isn't going to be smooth.
