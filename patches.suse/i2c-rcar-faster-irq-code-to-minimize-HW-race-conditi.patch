Subject: [PATCH] i2c: rcar: faster irq code to minimize HW race condition

References: git-fixes

To avoid the HW race condition on R-Car Gen2 and earlier, we need to
write to ICMCR as soon as possible in the interrupt handler. We can
improve this by writing a static value instead of masking out bits.
