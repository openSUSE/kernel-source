Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915/execlists: Cancel breadcrumb on preempting the virtual engine
Git-commit: 7d6b60dbc6a015dbdc444e4d39549600f7156690
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-7953

As we unwind the requests for a preemption event, we return a virtual
request back to its original virtual engine (so that it is available for
execution on any of its siblings). In the process, this means that its
breadcrumb should no longer be associated with the original physical
engine, and so we are forced to decouple it. Previously, as the request
could not complete without our awareness, we would move it to the next
real engine without any danger. However, preempt-to-busy allowed for
requests to continue on the HW and complete in the background as we
unwound, which meant that we could end up retiring the request before
fixing up the breadcrumb link.
