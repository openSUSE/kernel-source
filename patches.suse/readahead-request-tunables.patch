Subject: mm: readahead: Increase default readahead window
Patch-mainline: Never, mainline concerned by side-effects, <jack: will revisit upstream, Oct 4, 2017>
References: VM Performance, bnc#548529

Increase read_ahead_kb to values from SLES10 SP3 to get back sequential IO
performance. This could be a sysctl but the sysctl would only be applied
to files opened after the sysctl was updated.  While it is unlikely that
files opened by a systemd service earlier belong to processes that are
read-intensive, it is still possible and this is more visible to kernel
developers.

This is not in mainline due to concerns about side-effects. The most
important is that a large readahead at the wrong times causes either stalls
or IO starvations. For example, readahead on a slow device for data that
is not required would starve other reads for potentially a long time. Larger
readahead windows also increase memory footprint if the data was not required
which potentially causes stalls due to reclaim later.

This was evaluated on two machines
o a UMA machine, 8 cores and rotary storage
o A NUMA machine, 4 socket, 48 cores and SSD storage

Five basic tests were conducted;

1. paralleldd-single
   paralleldd uses different instances of dd to access a single file and
   write the contents to /dev/null. The performance of it depends on how
   well readahead works for a single file. It's mostly sequential IO.

2. paralleldd-multi
   Similar to test 1 except each instance of dd accesses a different file
   so each instance of dd is accessing data sequentially but the timing
   makes it look like random read IO.

3. pgbench-small
   A standard init of pgbench and execution with a small data set

4. pgbench-large
   A standard init of pgbench and execution with a large data set

5. bonnie++ with dataset sizes 2X RAM and in asyncronous mode

Results speak for themselves, readahead is a major boost when there
are multiple readers of data. It's not displayed but system CPU
usage is overall. The IO stats support the results

It shows that the average request size is 2.5 times larger even
though the merging stats are similar. It's also interesting to
note that average wait times are higher but more IO is being
initiated per dd instance.

It's interesting to note that this is specific to ext3 and that xfs showed
a small regression with larger readahead.

The IO stats are not displayed but show a similar ratio to ext3 and system
CPU usage is also lower. Hence, this slowdown is unexplained but may be
due to differences in XFS in the read path and how it locks even though
direct IO is not a factor. Tracing was not enabled to see what flags are
passed into xfs_ilock to see if the IO is all behind one lock but it's
one potential explanation.

UMA paralleldd-single on ext3

This showed nothing interesting as the test was too short-lived to draw
any conclusions. There was some difference in the kernels but it was
within the noise. The same applies for XFS.

UMA pgbench-small on ext3

This showed very little that was interesting. The database load time
was slower but by a very small margin. The actual transaction times
were highly variable and inconclusive.

Load times are not reported but they completed 1.5% faster.

The impact here is substantial particularly for higher thread-counts.
It's interesting to note that there is an apparent regression for low
thread counts. In general, there was a high degree of variability
but the gains were all outside of the noise. In general, the io stats
did not show any particular pattern about request size as the workload
is mostly resident in memory. The real curiousity is that readahead
should have had little or no impact here as the data is mostly resident
in memory. Observing the transactions over time, there was a lot of
variability and the performance is likely dominated by whether the
data happened to be local or not. In itself, this test does not push
for inclusion of the patch due to the lack of IO but is included for
completeness.

UMA pgbench-small on xfs

Similar observations to ext3 on the load times. The transaction times
were stable but showed no significant performance difference.

UMA pgbench-large on ext3

Database load times were slightly faster (3.36%). The transaction times
were slower on average, more variable but still very close to the noise.

UMA pgbench-large on xfs

No significant difference on either database load times or transactions.

The impact is small but in line with the UMA machine in a number of details.
As before, the CPU usage is lower even if the iostats show very little
differences overall.

Overall, the headline performance figures are mostly improved or show
little difference. There is a small anomaly with XFS that indicates it may
not always win there due to other factors. There is also the possibility
that a mostly random read workload that was larger than memory with each
read spanning multiple pages but less than the max readahead window would
suffer but the probability is low as the readahead window should scale
properly. On balance, this is a win -- particularly on the large read
workloads that a customer is likely to examine.
