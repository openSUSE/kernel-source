Subject: drm/bridge: parade-ps8640: Never store more than msg->size bytes in
 AUX xfer
Git-commit: 3164c8a70073d43629b4e11e083d3d2798f7750f
Patch-mainline: v6.7
References: jsc#PED-3527 jsc#PED-5475 jsc#PED-6068 jsc#PED-6070 jsc#PED-6116 jsc#PED-6120 jsc#PED-5065 jsc#PED-5477 jsc#PED-5511 jsc#PED-6041 jsc#PED-6069 jsc#PED-6071

While testing, I happened to notice a random crash that looked like:

  Kernel panic - not syncing: stack-protector:
  Kernel stack is corrupted in: drm_dp_dpcd_probe+0x120/0x120

Analysis of drm_dp_dpcd_probe() shows that we pass in a 1-byte buffer
(allocated on the stack) to the aux->transfer() function. Presumably
if the aux->transfer() writes more than one byte to this buffer then
we're in a bad shape.

Dropping into kgdb, I noticed that "aux->transfer" pointed at
ps8640_aux_transfer().

Reading through ps8640_aux_transfer(), I can see that there are cases
where it could write more bytes to msg->buffer than were specified by
msg->size. This could happen if the hardware reported back something
bogus to us. Let's fix this so we never write more than msg->size
bytes. We'll still read all the bytes from the hardware just in case
the hardware requires it since the aux transfer data comes through an
auto-incrementing register.

NOTE: I have no actual way to reproduce this issue but it seems likely
this is what was happening in the crash I looked at.
