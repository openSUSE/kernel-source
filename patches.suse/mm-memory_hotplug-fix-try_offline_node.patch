Subject: mm/memory_hotplug: fix try_offline_node()
Git-commit: 2c91f8fc6c999fe10185d8ad99fda1759f662f70
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc8
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.12

try_offline_node() is pretty much broken right now:

 - The node span is updated when onlining memory, not when adding it. We
   ignore memory that was mever onlined. Bad.

 - We touch possible garbage memmaps. The pfn_to_nid(pfn) can easily
   trigger a kernel panic. Bad for memory that is offline but also bad
   for subsection hotadd with ZONE_DEVICE, whereby the memmap of the
   first PFN of a section might contain garbage.

 - Sections belonging to mixed nodes are not properly considered.

As memory blocks might belong to multiple nodes, we would have to walk
all pageblocks (or at least subsections) within present sections.
However, we don't have a way to identify whether a memmap that is not
online was initialized (relevant for ZONE_DEVICE).  This makes things
more complicated.

Luckily, we can piggy pack on the node span and the nid stored in memory
blocks.  Currently, the node span is grown when calling
move_pfn_range_to_zone() - e.g., when onlining memory, and shrunk when
removing memory, before calling try_offline_node().  Sysfs links are
created via link_mem_sections(), e.g., during boot or when adding
memory.

If the node still spans memory or if any memory block belongs to the
nid, we don't set the node offline.  As memory blocks that span multiple
nodes cannot get offlined, the nid stored in memory blocks is reliable
enough (for such online memory blocks, the node still spans the memory).

Introduce for_each_memory_block() to efficiently walk all memory blocks.

Note: We will soon stop shrinking the ZONE_DEVICE zone and the node span
when removing ZONE_DEVICE memory to fix similar issues (access of
garbage memmaps) - until we have a reliable way to identify whether
these memmaps were properly initialized.  This implies later, that once
a node had ZONE_DEVICE memory, we won't be able to set a node offline -
which should be acceptable.

Since commit f1dd2cd13c4b ("mm, memory_hotplug: do not associate
hotadded memory to zones until online") memory that is added is not
assoziated with a zone/node (memmap not initialized).  The introducing
commit 60a5a19e7419 ("memory-hotplug: remove sysfs file of node")
already missed that we could have multiple nodes for a section and that
the zone/node span is updated when onlining pages, not when adding them.

I tested this by hotplugging two DIMMs to a memory-less and cpu-less
NUMA node.  The node is properly onlined when adding the DIMMs.  When
removing the DIMMs, the node is properly offlined.
