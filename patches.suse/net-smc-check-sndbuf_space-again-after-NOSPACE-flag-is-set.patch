Subject: net/smc: check sndbuf_space again after NOSPACE flag is set in
 smc_poll
Git-commit: 679e9ddcf90dbdf98aaaa71a492454654b627bcb
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc4
References: git-fixes jsc#PED-14951

When application sending data more than sndbuf_space, there have chances
application will sleep in epoll_wait, and will never be wakeup again. This
is caused by a race between smc_poll and smc_cdc_tx_handler.

application                                      tasklet
smc_tx_sendmsg(len > sndbuf_space)   |
epoll_wait for EPOLL_OUT,timeout=0   |
  smc_poll                           |
    if (!smc->conn.sndbuf_space)     |
                                     |  smc_cdc_tx_handler
                                     |    atomic_add sndbuf_space
                                     |    smc_tx_sndbuf_nonfull
                                     |      if (!test_bit SOCK_NOSPACE)
                                     |        do not sk_write_space;
      set_bit SOCK_NOSPACE;          |
    return mask=0;                   |

Application will sleep in epoll_wait as smc_poll returns 0. And
smc_cdc_tx_handler will not call sk_write_space because the SOCK_NOSPACE
has not be set. If there is no inflight cdc msg, sk_write_space will not be
called any more, and application will sleep in epoll_wait forever.
So check sndbuf_space again after NOSPACE flag is set to break the race.
