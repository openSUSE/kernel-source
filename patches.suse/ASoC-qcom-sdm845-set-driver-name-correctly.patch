Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: qcom: sdm845: set driver name correctly
Git-commit: 3f48b6eba15ea342ef4cb420b580f5ed6605669f
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc3
References: git-fixes

With the current state of code, we would endup with something like
below in /proc/asound/cards for 2 machines based on this driver.

Machine 1:
 0 [DB845c            ]: DB845c - DB845c
                       DB845c
Machine 2:
 0 [LenovoYOGAC6301]: Lenovo-YOGA-C63 - Lenovo-YOGA-C630-13Q50
                     LENOVO-81JL-LenovoYOGAC630_13Q50-LNVNB161216

This is not very UCM friendly both w.r.t to common up configs and
card identification, and UCM2 became totally not usefull with just
one ucm sdm845.conf for two machines which have different setups
w.r.t HDMI and other dais.

Reasons for such thing is partly because Qualcomm machine drivers never
cared to set driver_name.

This patch sets up driver name for the this driver to sort out the
UCM integration issues!

after this patch contents of /proc/asound/cards:

Machine 1:
 0 [DB845c         ]: sdm845 - DB845c
                      DB845c
Machine 2:
 0 [LenovoYOGAC6301]: sdm845 - Lenovo-YOGA-C630-13Q50
                     LENOVO-81JL-LenovoYOGAC630_13Q50-LNVNB161216

with this its possible to align with what UCM2 expects and we can have
sdm845/DB845.conf
sdm845/LENOVO-81JL-LenovoYOGAC630_13Q50-LNVNB161216.conf
... for board variants. This should scale much better!
