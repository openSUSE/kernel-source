Subject: netfs/fscache: Add a memory barrier for FSCACHE_VOLUME_CREATING
Git-commit: 22f9400a6f3560629478e0a64247b8fcc811a24d
References: CVE-2024-56755 bsc#1234920
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1

In fscache_create_volume(), there is a missing memory barrier between the
bit-clearing operation and the wake-up operation. This may cause a
situation where, after a wake-up, the bit-clearing operation hasn't been
detected yet, leading to an indefinite wait. The triggering process is as
follows:

  [cookie1]                [cookie2]                  [volume_work]
fscache_perform_lookup
  fscache_create_volume
                        fscache_perform_lookup
                          fscache_create_volume
			                        fscache_create_volume_work
                                                  cachefiles_acquire_volume
                                                  clear_and_wake_up_bit
    test_and_set_bit
                            test_and_set_bit
                              goto maybe_wait
      goto no_wait

In the above process, cookie1 and cookie2 has the same volume. When cookie1
enters the -no_wait- process, it will clear the bit and wake up the waiting
process. If a barrier is missing, it may cause cookie2 to remain in the
-wait- process indefinitely.

In commit 3288666c7256 ("fscache: Use clear_and_wake_up_bit() in
fscache_create_volume_work()"), barriers were added to similar operations
in fscache_create_volume_work(), but fscache_create_volume() was missed.

By combining the clear and wake operations into clear_and_wake_up_bit() to
fix this issue.
