  * How do these macros work?

- * In __COUNT_ARGS() _0 to _12 are just placeholders from the start
+ * In __COUNT_ARGS() _0 to _15 are just placeholders from the start
  * in order to make sure _n is positioned over the correct number
- * from 12 to 0 (depending on X, which is a variadic argument list).
+ * from 15 to 0 (depending on X, which is a variadic argument list).
  * They serve no purpose other than occupying a position. Since each
  * macro parameter must have a distinct identifier, those identifiers
  * are as good as any.
