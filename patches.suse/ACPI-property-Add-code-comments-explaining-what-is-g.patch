Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: property: Add code comments explaining what is going on
Git-commit: 737c3a09dcf69ba2814f3674947ccaec1861c985
Patch-mainline: v6.18-rc1
References: stable-fixes

In some places in the ACPI device properties handling code, it is
unclear why the code is what it is.  Some assumptions are not documented
and some pieces of code are based on knowledge that is not mentioned
anywhere.

Add code comments explaining these things.
