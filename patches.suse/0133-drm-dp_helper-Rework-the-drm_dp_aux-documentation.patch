Subject: drm/dp_helper: Rework the drm_dp_aux documentation
Git-commit: 14407d3afed07c48a536be01d92dcd9812bcb3d5
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

Split the existing documentation to move the comments on particular
fields next to them.
