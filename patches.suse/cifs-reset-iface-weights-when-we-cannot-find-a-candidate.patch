Subject: [PATCH] cifs: reset iface weights when we cannot find a candidate
Git-commit: 9d5eff7821f6d70f7d1b4d8a60680fba4de868a7
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc1

We now do a weighted selection of server interfaces when allocating
new channels. The weights are decided based on the speed advertised.
The fulfilled weight for an interface is a counter that is used to
track the interface selection. It should be reset back to zero once
all interfaces fulfilling their weight.

In cifs_chan_update_iface, this reset logic was missing. As a result
when the server interface list changes, the client may not be able
to find a new candidate for other channels after all interfaces have
been fulfilled.

Fixes: a6d8fb54a515 ("cifs: distribute channels across interfaces based on speed")
