Subject: x86/e820: Fix handling of subpage regions when calculating nosave
 ranges in e820__register_nosave_regions()
Git-commit: f2f29da9f0d4367f6ff35e0d9d021257bb53e273
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc2
References: git-fixes

While debugging kexec/hibernation hangs and crashes, it turned out that
the current implementation of e820__register_nosave_regions() suffers from
multiple serious issues:

 - The end of last region is tracked by PFN, causing it to find holes
   that aren't there if two consecutive subpage regions are present

 - The nosave PFN ranges derived from holes are rounded out (instead of
   rounded in) which makes it inconsistent with how explicitly reserved
   regions are handled

Fix this by:

 - Treating reserved regions as if they were holes, to ensure consistent
   handling (rounding out nosave PFN ranges is more correct as the
   kernel does not use partial pages)

 - Tracking the end of the last RAM region by address instead of pages
   to detect holes more precisely

These bugs appear to have been introduced about ~18 years ago with the very
first version of e820_mark_nosave_regions(), and its flawed assumptions were
carried forward uninterrupted through various waves of rewrites and renames.

[ mingo: Added Git archeology details, for kicks and giggles. ]
