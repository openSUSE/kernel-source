Subject: x86/cpuid: Fix up "virtual" IBRS/IBPB/STIBP feature bits on Intel
Git-commit: 7fcae1118f5fd44a862aa5c3525248e35ee67c3b
Patch-mainline: v4.16-rc1
References: bsc#1068032 CVE-2017-5753

Despite the fact that all the other code there seems to be doing it, just
using set_cpu_cap() in early_intel_init() doesn't actually work.

For CPUs with PKU support, setup_pku() calls get_cpu_cap() after
c->c_init() has set those feature bits. That resets those bits back to what
was queried from the hardware.

Turning the bits off for bad microcode is easy to fix. That can just use
setup_clear_cpu_cap() to force them off for all CPUs.

I was less keen on forcing the feature bits *on* that way, just in case
of inconsistencies. I appreciate that the kernel is going to get this
utterly wrong if CPU features are not consistent, because it has already
applied alternatives by the time secondary CPUs are brought up.

But at least if setup_force_cpu_cap() isn't being used, we might have a
chance of *detecting* the lack of the corresponding bit and either
panicking or refusing to bring the offending CPU online.

So ensure that the appropriate feature bits are set within get_cpu_cap()
regardless of how many extra times it's called.
