Subject: netfilter: xt_time: use time64_t
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
Git-commit: fcbad8293d52864d87d0b9f6035fd87a049d59d8
References: bsc#1176447

The current xt_time driver suffers from the y2038 overflow on 32-bit
architectures, when the time of day calculations break.

Also, on both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures, there is a problem with
info->date_start/stop, which is part of the user ABI and overflows in
in 2106.

Fix the first issue by using time64_t and explicit calls to div_u64()
and div_u64_rem(), and document the seconds issue.

The explicit 64-bit division is unfortunately slower on 32-bit
architectures, but doing it as unsigned lets us use the optimized
division-through-multiplication path in most configurations.  This should
be fine, as the code already does not allow any negative time of day
values.

Using u32 seconds values consistently would probably also work and
be a little more efficient, but that doesn't feel right as it would
propagate the y2106 overflow to more place rather than fewer.
