Subject: sched/core: Fix PI boosting between RT and DEADLINE tasks
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc3
Git-commit: 740797ce3a124b7dd22b7fb832d87bc8fba1cf6f
References: bsc#1172823 git-fixes

syzbot reported the following warning:

 WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 6351 at kernel/sched/deadline.c:628
 enqueue_task_dl+0x22da/0x38a0 kernel/sched/deadline.c:1504

At deadline.c:628 we have:

 623 static inline void setup_new_dl_entity(struct sched_dl_entity *dl_se)
 624 {
 625 	struct dl_rq *dl_rq = dl_rq_of_se(dl_se);
 626 	struct rq *rq = rq_of_dl_rq(dl_rq);
 627
 628 	WARN_ON(dl_se->dl_boosted);
 629 	WARN_ON(dl_time_before(rq_clock(rq), dl_se->deadline));
        [...]
     }

Which means that setup_new_dl_entity() has been called on a task
currently boosted. This shouldn't happen though, as setup_new_dl_entity()
is only called when the 'dynamic' deadline of the new entity
is in the past w.r.t. rq_clock and boosted tasks shouldn't verify this
condition.

Digging through the PI code I noticed that what above might in fact happen
if an RT tasks blocks on an rt_mutex hold by a DEADLINE task. In the
first branch of boosting conditions we check only if a pi_task 'dynamic'
deadline is earlier than mutex holder's and in this case we set mutex
holder to be dl_boosted. However, since RT 'dynamic' deadlines are only
initialized if such tasks get boosted at some point (or if they become
DEADLINE of course), in general RT 'dynamic' deadlines are usually equal
to 0 and this verifies the aforementioned condition.

Fix it by checking that the potential donor task is actually (even if
temporary because in turn boosted) running at DEADLINE priority before
using its 'dynamic' deadline value.
