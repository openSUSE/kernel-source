Subject: [PATCH] vsock: Set socket state back to SS_UNCONNECTED in vsock_connect_timeout()
Git-commit: a3e7b29e30854ed67be0d17687e744ad0c769c4b
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: git-fixes

Imagine two non-blocking vsock_connect() requests on the same socket.
The first request schedules @connect_work, and after it times out,
vsock_connect_timeout() sets *sock* state back to TCP_CLOSE, but keeps
*socket* state as SS_CONNECTING.

Later, the second request returns -EALREADY, meaning the socket "already
has a pending connection in progress", even though the first request has
already timed out.

As suggested by Stefano, fix it by setting *socket* state back to
SS_UNCONNECTED, so that the second request will return -ETIMEDOUT.
