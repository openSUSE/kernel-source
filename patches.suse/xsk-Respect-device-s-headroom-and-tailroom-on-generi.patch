Subject: xsk: Respect device's headroom and tailroom on generic xmit path
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc1
Git-commit: 3914d88f7608e6c2e80e344474fa289370c32451
References: git-fixes

xsk_generic_xmit() allocates a new skb and then queues it for
xmitting. The size of new skb's headroom is desc->len, so it comes
to the driver/device with no reserved headroom and/or tailroom.
Lots of drivers need some headroom (and sometimes tailroom) to
prepend (and/or append) some headers or data, e.g. CPU tags,
device-specific headers/descriptors (LSO, TLS etc.), and if case
of no available space skb_cow_head() will reallocate the skb.
Reallocations are unwanted on fast-path, especially when it comes
to XDP, so generic XSK xmit should reserve the spaces declared in
dev->needed_headroom and dev->needed tailroom to avoid them.

Note on max(NET_SKB_PAD, L1_CACHE_ALIGN(dev->needed_headroom)):

Usually, output functions reserve LL_RESERVED_SPACE(dev), which
consists of dev->hard_header_len + dev->needed_headroom, aligned
by 16.

However, on XSK xmit hard header is already here in the chunk, so
hard_header_len is not needed. But it'd still be better to align
data up to cacheline, while reserving no less than driver requests
for headroom. NET_SKB_PAD here is to double-insure there will be
no reallocations even when the driver advertises no needed_headroom,
but in fact need it (not so rare case).
