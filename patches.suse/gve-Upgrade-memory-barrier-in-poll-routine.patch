Subject: gve: Upgrade memory barrier in poll routine
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc4
Git-commit: f81781835f0adfae8d701545386030d223efcd6f
References: git-fixes

As currently written, if the driver checks for more work (via
gve_tx_poll or gve_rx_poll) before the device posts work and the
irq doorbell is not unmasked
(via iowrite32be(GVE_IRQ_ACK | GVE_IRQ_EVENT, ...)) before the device
attempts to raise an interrupt, an interrupt is lost and this could
potentially lead to the traffic being completely halted. For
example, if a tx queue has already been stopped, the driver won't get
the chance to complete work and egress will be halted.

We need a full memory barrier in the poll
routine to ensure that the irq doorbell is unmasked before the driver
checks for more work.
