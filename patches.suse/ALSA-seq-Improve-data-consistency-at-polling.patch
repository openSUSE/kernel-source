Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: seq: Improve data consistency at polling
Git-commit: e3cd33ab17c33bd8f1a9df66ec83a15dd8f7afbb
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc1
References: stable-fixes

snd_seq_poll() calls snd_seq_write_pool_allocated() that reads out a
field in client->pool object, while it can be updated concurrently via
ioctls, as reported by syzbot.  The data race itself is harmless, as
it's merely a poll() call, and the state is volatile.  OTOH, the read
out of poll object info from the caller side is fragile, and we can
leave it better in snd_seq_pool_poll_wait() alone.

A similar pattern is seen in snd_seq_kernel_client_write_poll(), too,
which is called from the OSS sequencer.

This patch drops the pool checks from the caller side and add the
pool->lock in snd_seq_pool_poll_wait() for better data consistency.
