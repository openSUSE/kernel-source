Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda: Allow HDA to be runtime suspended when dGPU is not bound to a driver
Git-commit: bacd861452d2be86a4df341b12e32db7dac8021e
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: git-fixes

Nvidia proprietary driver doesn't support runtime power management, so
when a user only wants to use the integrated GPU, it's a common practice
to let dGPU not to bind any driver, and let its upstream port to be
runtime suspended. At the end of runtime suspension the port uses
platform power management to disable power through _OFF method of power
resource, which is listed by _PR3.

After commit b516ea586d71 ("PCI: Enable NVIDIA HDA controllers"), when
the dGPU comes with an HDA function, the HDA won't be suspended if the
dGPU is unbound, so the power resource can't be turned off by its
upstream port driver.

Commit 37a3a98ef601 ("ALSA: hda - Enable runtime PM only for
discrete GPU") only allows HDA to be runtime suspended once GPU is
bound, to keep APU's HDA working.

However, HDA on dGPU isn't that useful if dGPU is not bound to any
driver.  So let's relax the runtime suspend requirement for dGPU's HDA
function, to disable the power source to save lots of power.
