Subject: [PATCH] MM: replace PF_LESS_THROTTLE with PF_LOCAL_THROTTLE
Patch-mainline: Submitted, Tue, 07 Apr 2020 09:44:25 +1000 - linux-mm@kvack.org,
References: bsc#1163403

PF_LESS_THROTTLE exists for loop-back nfsd, and a similar need in the
loop block driver, where a daemon needs to write to one bdi in
order to free up writes queued to another bdi.

The daemon sets PF_LESS_THROTTLE and gets a larger allowance of dirty
pages, so that it can still dirty pages after other processses have been
throttled.

This approach was designed when all threads were blocked equally,
independently on which device they were writing to, or how fast it was.
Since that time the writeback algorithm has changed substantially with
different threads getting different allowances based on non-trivial
heuristics.  This means the simple "add 25%" heuristic is no longer
reliable.

This patch changes the heuristic to ignore the global limits and
consider only the limit relevant to the bdi being written to.  This
approach is already available for BDI_CAP_STRICTLIMIT users (fuse) and
should not introduce surprises.  This has the desired result of
protecting the task from the consequences of large amounts of dirty data
queued for other devices.

This approach of "only consider the target bdi" is consistent with the
other use of PF_LESS_THROTTLE in current_may_throttle(), were it causes
attention to be focussed only on the target bdi.

So this patch
 - renames PF_LESS_THROTTLE to PF_LOCAL_THROTTLE,
 - remove the 25% bonus that that flag gives, and
 - imposes 'strictlimit' handling for any process with PF_LOCAL_THROTTLE
   set.

Note that previously realtime threads were treated the same as
PF_LESS_THROTTLE threads.  This patch does *not* change the behvaiour for
real-time threads, so it is now different from the behaviour of nfsd and
loop tasks.  I don't know what is wanted for realtime.
