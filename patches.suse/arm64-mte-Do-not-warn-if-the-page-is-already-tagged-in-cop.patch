Subject: arm64: mte: Do not warn if the page is already tagged in
 copy_highpage()
Git-commit: b98c94eed4a975e0c80b7e90a649a46967376f58
Patch-mainline: v6.18-rc3
References: git-fixes CVE-2025-40353 bsc#1255312

The arm64 copy_highpage() assumes that the destination page is newly
allocated and not MTE-tagged (PG_mte_tagged unset) and warns
accordingly. However, following commit 060913999d7a ("mm: migrate:
support poisoned recover from migrate folio"), folio_mc_copy() is called
before __folio_migrate_mapping(). If the latter fails (-EAGAIN), the
copy will be done again to the same destination page. Since
copy_highpage() already set the PG_mte_tagged flag, this second copy
will warn.

Replace the WARN_ON_ONCE(page already tagged) in the arm64
copy_highpage() with a comment.
