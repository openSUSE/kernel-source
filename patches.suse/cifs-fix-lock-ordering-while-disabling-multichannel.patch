Subject: [PATCH] cifs: fix lock ordering while disabling multichannel
Git-commit: 5eef12c4e3230f2025dc46ad8c4a3bc19978e5d7
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc2

The code to handle the case of server disabling multichannel
was picking iface_lock with chan_lock held. This goes against
the lock ordering rules, as iface_lock is a higher order lock
(even if it isn't so obvious).

This change fixes the lock ordering by doing the following in
that order for each secondary channel:
1. store iface and server pointers in local variable
2. remove references to iface and server in channels
3. unlock chan_lock
4. lock iface_lock
5. dec ref count for iface
6. unlock iface_lock
7. dec ref count for server
8. lock chan_lock again

Since this function can only be called in smb2_reconnect, and
that cannot be called by two parallel processes, we should not
have races due to dropping chan_lock between steps 3 and 8.
