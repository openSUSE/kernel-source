Subject: [PATCH 1/1] RDMA/bnxt_re: Correct the sequence of device suspend
Git-commit: 68b3bca2df00f0a63f0aa2db2b2adc795665229e
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
References: jsc#PED-11250

When in fatal error condition, mark device as detached first
and then complete all pending HWRM commands as firmware is not
going to process them and eventually time out. Move the device
to error only if suspend is called when device is in Fatal state.

Also, remove some outdated comments. Remove the stop_irq call
which is no longer required.

Fixes: cc5b9b48d447 ("RDMA/bnxt_re: Recover the device when FW error is detected")
