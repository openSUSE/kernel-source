Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: usb-audio: Fix PCM buffer allocation in non-vmalloc mode
Git-commit: fb3c293b82c31a9a68fbcf4e7a45fadd8a47ea2b
Patch-mainline: v5.12-rc1
References: git-fixes

The commit f274baa49be6 ("ALSA: usb-audio: Allow non-vmalloc buffer
for PCM buffers") introduced the mode to allocate coherent pages for
PCM buffers, and it used bus->controller device as its DMA device.
It turned out, however, that bus->sysdev is a more appropriate device
to be used for DMA mapping in HCD code.

This patch corrects the device reference accordingly.

Note that, on most platforms, both point to the very same device,
hence this patch doesn't change anything practically.  But on
platforms like xhcd-plat hcd, the change becomes effective.
