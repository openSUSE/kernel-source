Subject: drm/vc4: hdmi: Take into account the clock doubling flag in
 atomic_check
Git-commit: 320e84dc6111ecc1c957e2b186d4d2bafee6bde2
Patch-mainline: v5.11 or v5.11-rc8 (next release)
References: git-fixes

Commit 63495f6b4aed ("drm/vc4: hdmi: Make sure our clock rate is within
limits") was intended to compute the pixel rate to make sure we remain
within the boundaries of what the hardware can provide.

However, unlike what mode_valid was checking for, we forgot to take
into account the clock doubling flag that can be set for modes. Let's
honor that flag if it's there.
