Subject: [PATCH] filelock: Fix fcntl/close race recovery compat path
Git-commit: f8138f2ad2f745b9a1c696a05b749eabe44337ea
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
References: bsc#1228427 CVE-2024-41020

When I wrote commit 3cad1bc01041 ("filelock: Remove locks reliably when
fcntl/close race is detected"), I missed that there are two copies of the
code I was patching: The normal version, and the version for 64-bit offsets
on 32-bit kernels.
Thanks to Greg KH for stumbling over this while doing the stable
backport...

Apply exactly the same fix to the compat path for 32-bit kernels.
