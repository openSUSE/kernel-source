Subject: [PATCH] spi: ch341: fix out-of-bounds memory access in ch341_transfer_one
Git-commit: 545d1287e40a55242f6ab68bcc1ba3b74088b1bc
Patch-mainline: v6.19-rc1
References: git-fixes CVE-2025-68352 bsc#1255541

Discovered by Atuin - Automated Vulnerability Discovery Engine.

The 'len' variable is calculated as 'min(32, trans->len + 1)',
which includes the 1-byte command header.

When copying data from 'trans->tx_buf' to 'ch341->tx_buf + 1', using 'len'
as the length is incorrect because:

1. It causes an out-of-bounds read from 'trans->tx_buf' (which has size
   'trans->len', i.e., 'len - 1' in this context).
2. It can cause an out-of-bounds write to 'ch341->tx_buf' if 'len' is
   CH341_PACKET_LENGTH (32). Writing 32 bytes to ch341->tx_buf + 1
   overflows the buffer.

Fix this by copying 'len - 1' bytes.
