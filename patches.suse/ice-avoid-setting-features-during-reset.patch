Subject: ice: avoid setting features during reset
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
Git-commit: 5f8cc355c4134767aa586920458cc21e01295715
References: jsc#SLE-7926

Certain subsystems behave very badly when called during reset (core
dump). This patch returns -EBUSY when reconfiguring some subsystems
during reset. With this patch some ethtool functions will not core
dump during reset.
