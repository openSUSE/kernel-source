Subject: bpf, docs: Change underline in btf to match style guide
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
Git-commit: 3ff36bffaf3545d46e7dedcd8b89e62591de246d
References: jsc#PED-1368

This changes the type of underline used to follow the guidelines in
Documentation/doc-guide/sphinx.rst which also ensures that the headings
are rendered at the correct level in the HTML sidebar
