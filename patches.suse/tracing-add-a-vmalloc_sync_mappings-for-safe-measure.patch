Subject: tracing: Add a vmalloc_sync_mappings() for safe measure
Git-commit: 11f5efc3ab66284f7aaacc926e9351d658e2577b
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc5
References: git-fixes

x86_64 lazily maps in the vmalloc pages, and the way this works with per_cpu
areas can be complex, to say the least. Mappings may happen at boot up, and
if nothing synchronizes the page tables, those page mappings may not be
synced till they are used. This causes issues for anything that might touch
one of those mappings in the path of the page fault handler. When one of
those unmapped mappings is touched in the page fault handler, it will cause
another page fault, which in turn will cause a page fault, and leave us in
a loop of page faults.

Commit 763802b53a42 ("x86/mm: split vmalloc_sync_all()") split
vmalloc_sync_all() into vmalloc_sync_unmappings() and
vmalloc_sync_mappings(), as on system exit, it did not need to do a full
sync on x86_64 (although it still needed to be done on x86_32). By chance,
the vmalloc_sync_all() would synchronize the page mappings done at boot up
and prevent the per cpu area from being a problem for tracing in the page
fault handler. But when that synchronization in the exit of a task became a
nop, it caused the problem to appear.
