Subject: [PATCH] lib/xz: Validate the value before assigning it to an enum variable
Git-commit: 4f8d7abaa413c34da9d751289849dbfb7c977d05
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: git-fixes

This might matter, for example, if the underlying type of enum xz_check
was a signed char. In such a case the validation wouldn't have caught an
unsupported header. I don't know if this problem can occur in the kernel
on any arch but it's still good to fix it because some people might copy
the XZ code to their own projects from Linux instead of the upstream
XZ Embedded repository.

This change may increase the code size by a few bytes. An alternative
would have been to use an unsigned int instead of enum xz_check but
using an enumeration looks cleaner.
