Subject: smb3: fix unmount hang in open_shroot
Git-commit: 96d9f7ed00b86104bf03adeffc8980897e9694ab
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.4

An earlier patch "CIFS: fix deadlock in cached root handling"
did not completely address the deadlock in open_shroot. This
patch addresses the deadlock.

In testing the recent patch:
  smb3: improve handling of share deleted (and share recreated)
we were able to reproduce the open_shroot deadlock to one
of the target servers in unmount in a delete share scenario.

Fixes: 7e5a70ad88b1e ("CIFS: fix deadlock in cached root handling")

This is version 2 of this patch. An earlier version of this
patch "smb3: fix unmount hang in open_shroot" had a problem
found by Dan.
