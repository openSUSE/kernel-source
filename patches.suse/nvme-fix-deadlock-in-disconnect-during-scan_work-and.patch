Subject: [PATCH] nvme: fix deadlock in disconnect during scan_work and/or
 ana_work
Git-commit: ecca390e80561debbfdb4dc96bf94595136889fa
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc1
References: git-fixes

A deadlock happens in the following scenario with multipath:
1) scan_work(nvme0) detects a new nsid while nvme0
    is an optimized path to it, path nvme1 happens to be
    inaccessible.

2) Before scan_work is complete nvme0 disconnect is initiated
    nvme_delete_ctrl_sync() sets nvme0 state to NVME_CTRL_DELETING

3) scan_work(1) attempts to submit IO,
    but nvme_path_is_optimized() observes nvme0 is not LIVE.
    Since nvme1 is a possible path IO is requeued and scan_work hangs.

4) Delete also hangs in flush_work(ctrl->scan_work)
    from nvme_remove_namespaces().

Similiarly a deadlock with ana_work may happen: if ana_work has started
and calls nvme_mpath_set_live and device_add_disk, it will
trigger I/O. When we trigger disconnect I/O will block because
our accessible (optimized) path is disconnecting, but the alternate
path is inaccessible, so I/O blocks. Then disconnect tries to flush
the ana_work and hangs.

Fix this by introducing a new state: NVME_CTRL_DELETE_NOIO, which will
indicate the phase of controller deletion where I/O cannot be allowed
to access the namespace. NVME_CTRL_DELETING still allows mpath I/O to
be issued to the bottom device, and only after we flush the ana_work
and scan_work (after nvme_stop_ctrl and nvme_prep_remove_namespaces)
we change the state to NVME_CTRL_DELETING_NOIO. Also we prevent ana_work
from re-firing by aborting early if we are not LIVE, so we should be safe
here.

In addition, change the transport drivers to follow the updated state
machine.
