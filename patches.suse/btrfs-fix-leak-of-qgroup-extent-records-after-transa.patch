Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: fix leak of qgroup extent records after transaction
 abort

Qgroup extent records are created when delayed ref heads are created and
then released after accounting extents at btrfs_qgroup_account_extents(),
called during the transaction commit path.

If a transaction is aborted we free the qgroup records by calling
btrfs_qgroup_destroy_extent_records() at btrfs_destroy_delayed_refs(),
unless we don't have delayed references. We are incorrectly assuming
that no delayed references means we don't have qgroup extents records.

We can currently have no delayed references because we ran them all
during a transaction commit and the transaction was aborted after that
due to some error in the commit path.

So fix this by ensuring we btrfs_qgroup_destroy_extent_records() at
btrfs_destroy_delayed_refs() even if we don't have any delayed references.
