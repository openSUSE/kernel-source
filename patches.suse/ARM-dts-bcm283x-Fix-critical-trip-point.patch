Subject: ARM: dts: bcm283x: Fix critical trip point
Git-commit: 30e647a764d446723a7e0fb08d209e0104f16173
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc3
References: bsc#1164158

During definition of the CPU thermal zone of BCM283x SoC family there
was a misunderstanding of the meaning "criticial trip point" and the
thermal throttling range of the VideoCore firmware. The latter one takes
effect when the core temperature is at least 85 degree celsius or higher

So the current critical trip point doesn't make sense, because the
thermal shutdown appears before the firmware has a chance to throttle
the ARM core(s).

Fix these unwanted shutdowns by increasing the critical trip point
to a value which shouldn't be reached with working thermal throttling.
