Subject: [PATCH] sched/fair: Spread out tasks evenly when not overloaded

References: bnc#1155798 (CPU scheduler functional and performance backports)
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
Git-commit: 2ab4092fc82d6001fdd9d51dbba27d04dec967e0

When there is only one CPU per group, using the idle CPUs to evenly spread
tasks doesn't make sense and nr_running is a better metrics.
