Subject: [PATCH] io_uring: check if we need to reschedule during overflow
 flush
Git-commit: eac2ca2d682f94f46b1973bdf5e77d85d77b8e53
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc1
References: bsc#1232417 CVE-2024-50060

In terms of normal application usage, this list will always be empty.
And if an application does overflow a bit, it'll have a few entries.
However, nothing obviously prevents syzbot from running a test case
that generates a ton of overflow entries, and then flushing them can
take quite a while.

Check for needing to reschedule while flushing, and drop our locks and
do so if necessary. There's no state to maintain here as overflows
always prune from head-of-list, hence it's fine to drop and reacquire
the locks at the end of the loop.
