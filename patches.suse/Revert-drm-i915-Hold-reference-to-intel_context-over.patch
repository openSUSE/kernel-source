Subject: Revert "drm/i915: Hold reference to intel_context over life of
 i915_request"
Git-commit: bcb9aa45d5a0e11ef91245330c53cde214d15e8d
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225 jsc#PED-2849

This reverts commit 1e98d8c52ed5dfbaf273c4423c636525c2ce59e7.

The problem with this patch is that it makes i915_request to hold a
reference to intel_context, which in turn holds a reference on the VM.
This strong back referencing can lead to reference loops which leads
to resource leak.

An example is the upcoming VM_BIND work which requires VM to hold
a reference to some shared VM specific BO. But this BO's dma-resv
fences holds reference to the i915_request thus leading to reference
loop.

v2:
  Do not use reserved requests for virtual engines
