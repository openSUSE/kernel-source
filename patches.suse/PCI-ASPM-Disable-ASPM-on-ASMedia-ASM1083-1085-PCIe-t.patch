Subject: [PATCH] PCI/ASPM: Disable ASPM on ASMedia ASM1083/1085 PCIe-to-PCI bridge
Git-commit: b361663c5a40c8bc758b7f7f2239f7a192180e7c
Patch-mainline: v5.8 or v5.8-rc8 (next release)
References: git-fixes

Recently ASPM handling was changed to allow ASPM on PCIe-to-PCI/PCI-X
bridges.  Unfortunately the ASMedia ASM1083/1085 PCIe to PCI bridge device
doesn't seem to function properly with ASPM enabled.  On an Asus PRIME
H270-PRO motherboard, it causes errors like these:

  pcieport 0000:00:1c.0: AER: PCIe Bus Error: severity=Corrected, type=Data Link Layer, (Transmitter ID)
  pcieport 0000:00:1c.0: AER:   device [8086:a292] error status/mask=00003000/00002000
  pcieport 0000:00:1c.0: AER:    [12] Timeout
  pcieport 0000:00:1c.0: AER: Corrected error received: 0000:00:1c.0
  pcieport 0000:00:1c.0: AER: can't find device of ID00e0

In addition to flooding the kernel log, this also causes the machine to
wake up immediately after suspend is initiated.

The device advertises ASPM L0s and L1 support in the Link Capabilities
register, but the ASMedia web page for ASM1083 [1] claims "No PCIe ASPM
support".

Windows 10 (build 2004) enables L0s, but it also logs correctable PCIe
errors.

Add a quirk to disable ASPM for this device.
