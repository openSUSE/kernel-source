Subject: [PATCH] drm/xe/userptr: fix EFAULT handling

Alt-commit: 6b93cb98910c826c2e2004942f8b060311e43618
References: git-fixes CVE-2025-21880 bsc#1240170

Currently we treat EFAULT from hmm_range_fault() as a non-fatal error
when called from xe_vm_userptr_pin() with the idea that we want to avoid
killing the entire vm and chucking an error, under the assumption that
the user just did an unmap or something, and has no intention of
actually touching that memory from the GPU.  At this point we have
already zapped the PTEs so any access should generate a page fault, and
if the pin fails there also it will then become fatal.

However it looks like it's possible for the userptr vma to still be on
the rebind list in preempt_rebind_work_func(), if we had to retry the
pin again due to something happening in the caller before we did the
rebind step, but in the meantime needing to re-validate the userptr and
this time hitting the EFAULT.

This explains an internal user report of hitting:

Followed by NPD, when running some workload, since the sg was never
actually populated but the vma is still marked for rebind when it should
be skipped for this special EFAULT case. This is confirmed to fix the
user report.

v2 (MattB):
 - Move earlier.
v3 (MattB):
 - Update the commit message to make it clear that this indeed fixes the
   issue.
