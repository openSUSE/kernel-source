Subject: accel/habanalabs: set default device release watchdog T/O as 30 sec
Git-commit: 10926f60051332a754084d45862afc4e83e597e1
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: drm-backport-placeholder

After being notified about certain errors, user is expected to finish
his post-errors actions and to release the device within some timeout,
after which is deice is being reset.
The default timeout value is 5 sec, which in some case is not enough for
a user application to collect debug data.
Increase the default value to 30 sec.
