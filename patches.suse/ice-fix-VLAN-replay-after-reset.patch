Subject: ice: fix VLAN replay after reset
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc3
Git-commit: 0eae2c136cb624e4050092feb59f18159b4f2512
References: git-fixes

There is a bug currently when there are more than one VLAN defined
and any reset that affects the PF is initiated, after the reset rebuild
no traffic will pass on any VLAN but the last one created.

This is caused by the iteration though the VLANs during replay each
clearing the vsi_map bitmap of the VSI that is being replayed.  The
problem is that during rhe replay, the pointer to the vsi_map bitmap
is used by each successive vlan to determine if it should be replayed
on this VSI.

The logic was that the replay of the VLAN would replace the bit in the map
before the next VLAN would iterate through.  But, since the replay copies
the old bitmap pointer to filt_replay_rules and creates a new one for the
recreated VLANS, it does not do this, and leaves the old bitmap broken
to be used to replay the remaining VLANs.

Since the old bitmap will be cleaned up in post replay cleanup, there is
no need to alter it and break following VLAN replay, so don't clear the
bit.
