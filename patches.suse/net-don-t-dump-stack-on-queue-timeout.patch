Subject: net: don't dump stack on queue timeout
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
Git-commit: e316dd1cf1358ff9c44b37c7be273a7dc4349986
References: git-fixes

The top syzbot report for networking (#14 for the entire kernel)
is the queue timeout splat. We kept it around for a long time,
because in real life it provides pretty strong signal that
something is wrong with the driver or the device.

Removing it is also likely to break monitoring for those who
track it as a kernel warning.

Nevertheless, WARN()ings are best suited for catching kernel
programming bugs. If a Tx queue gets starved due to a pause
storm, priority configuration, or other weirdness - that's
obviously a problem, but not a problem we can fix at
the kernel level.

Bite the bullet and convert the WARN() to a print.

Before:

  NETDEV WATCHDOG: eni1np1 (netdevsim): transmit queue 0 timed out 1975 ms
  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 0 at net/sched/sch_generic.c:525 dev_watchdog+0x39e/0x3b0
  [... completely pointless stack trace of a timer follows ...]

Now:

  netdevsim netdevsim1 eni1np1: NETDEV WATCHDOG: CPU: 0: transmit queue 0 timed out 1769 ms

Alternatively we could mark the drivers which syzbot has
learned to abuse as "print-instead-of-WARN" selectively.
