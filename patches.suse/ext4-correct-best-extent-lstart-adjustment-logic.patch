Subject: [PATCH] ext4: correct best extent lstart adjustment logic
Git-commit: 4fbf8bc733d14bceb16dda46a3f5e19c6a9621c5
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: bsc#1234179

When yangerkun review commit 93cdf49f6eca ("ext4: Fix best extent lstart
adjustment logic in ext4_mb_new_inode_pa()"), it was found that the best
extent did not completely cover the original request after adjusting the
best extent lstart in ext4_mb_new_inode_pa() as follows:

  original request: 2/10(8)
  normalized request: 0/64(64)
  best extent: 0/9(9)

When we check if best ex can be kept at start of goal, ac_o_ex.fe_logical
is 2 less than the adjusted best extent logical end 9, so we think the
adjustment is done. But obviously 0/9(9) doesn't cover 2/10(8), so we
should determine here if the original request logical end is less than or
equal to the adjusted best extent logical end.

In addition, add a comment stating when adjusted best_ex will not cover
the original request, and remove the duplicate assertion because adjusting
lstart makes no change to b_ex.fe_len.
