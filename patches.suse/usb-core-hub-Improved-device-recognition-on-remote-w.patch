Subject: [PATCH] usb: core: hub: Improved device recognition on remote wakeup
Git-commit: 9c06ac4c83df6d6fbdbf7488fbad822b4002ba19
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc7
References: git-fixes

If hub_activate() is called before D+ has stabilized after remote
wakeup, the following situation might occur:

         __      ___________________
        /  \    /
D+   __/    \__/

Hub  _______________________________
          |  ^   ^           ^
          |  |   |           |
Host _____v__|___|___________|______
          |  |   |           |
          |  |   |           \-- Interrupt Transfer (*3)
          |  |    \-- ClearPortFeature (*2)
          |   \-- GetPortStatus (*1)
          \-- Host detects remote wakeup

- D+ goes high, Host starts running by remote wakeup
- D+ is not stable, goes low
- Host requests GetPortStatus at (*1) and gets the following hub status:
  - Current Connect Status bit is 0
  - Connect Status Change bit is 1
- D+ stabilizes, goes high
- Host requests ClearPortFeature and thus Connect Status Change bit is
  cleared at (*2)
- After waiting 100 ms, Host starts the Interrupt Transfer at (*3)
- Since the Connect Status Change bit is 0, Hub returns NAK.

In this case, port_event() is not called in hub_event() and Host cannot
recognize device. To solve this issue, flag change_bits even if only
Connect Status Change bit is 1 when got in the first GetPortStatus.

This issue occurs rarely because it only if D+ changes during a very
short time between GetPortStatus and ClearPortFeature. However, it is
fatal if it occurs in embedded system.
