Subject: x86/speculation: Add Kconfig option for GDS
Git-commit: 53cf5797f114ba2bd86d23a862302119848eff19
Patch-mainline: v6.6 or v6.5-rc3 (next release)
References: bsc#1206418, CVE-2022-40982

Gather Data Sampling (GDS) is mitigated in microcode. However, on
systems that haven't received the updated microcode, disabling AVX
can act as a mitigation. Add a Kconfig option that uses the microcode
mitigation if available and disables AVX otherwise. Setting this
option has no effect on systems not affected by GDS. This is the
equivalent of setting gather_data_sampling=force.

+	  Gather Data Sampling (GDS) is a hardware vulnerability which allows
+	  unprivileged speculative access to data which was previously stored in
+	  vector registers.
+
+	  This option is equivalent to setting gather_data_sampling=force on the
+	  command line. The microcode mitigation is used if present, otherwise
+	  AVX is disabled as a mitigation. On affected systems that are missing
+	  the microcode any userspace code that unconditionally uses AVX will
+	  break with this option set.
+
+	  Setting this option on systems not vulnerable to GDS has no effect.
+
+	  If in doubt, say N.
