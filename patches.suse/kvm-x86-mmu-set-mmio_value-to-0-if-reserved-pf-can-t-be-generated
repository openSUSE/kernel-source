Subject: KVM: x86/mmu: Set mmio_value to '0' if reserved #PF can't be generated
Git-commit: 6129ed877d409037b79866327102c9dc59a302fe
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
References: bsc#1171904

Set the mmio_value to '0' instead of simply clearing the present bit to
squash a benign warning in kvm_mmu_set_mmio_spte_mask() that complains
about the mmio_value overlapping the lower GFN mask on systems with 52
bits of PA space.

Opportunistically clean up the code and comments.
