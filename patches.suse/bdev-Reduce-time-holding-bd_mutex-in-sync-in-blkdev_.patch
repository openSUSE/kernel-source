Subject: [PATCH] bdev: Reduce time holding bd_mutex in sync in blkdev_close()
Git-commit: b849dd84b6ccfe32622988b79b7b073861fcf9f7

References: bsc#1175995,jsc#SLE-15608

While trying to "dd" to the block device for a USB stick, I
encountered a hung task warning (blocked for > 120 seconds).  I
managed to come up with an easy way to reproduce this on my system
(where /dev/sdb is the block device for my USB stick) with:

  while true; do dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=4M; done

With my reproduction here are the relevant bits from the hung task
detector:

 INFO: task udevd:294 blocked for more than 122 seconds.

The problem appears related to the fact that my USB disk is terribly
slow and that I have a lot of RAM in my system to cache things.
Specifically my writes seem to be happening at ~15 MB/s and I've got
~4 GB of RAM in my system that can be used for buffering.  To write 4
GB of buffer to disk thus takes ~4000 MB / ~15 MB/s = ~267 seconds.

The 267 second number is a problem because in __blkdev_put() we call
sync_blockdev() while holding the bd_mutex.  Any other callers who
want the bd_mutex will be blocked for the whole time.

The problem is made worse because I believe blkdev_put() specifically
tells other tasks (namely udev) to go try to access the device at right
around the same time we're going to hold the mutex for a long time.

Putting some traces around this (after disabling the hung task detector),
I could confirm:
 dd:    437.608600: __blkdev_put() right before sync_blockdev() for sdb
 udevd: 437.623901: blkdev_open() right before blkdev_get() for sdb
 dd:    661.468451: __blkdev_put() right after sync_blockdev() for sdb
 udevd: 663.820426: blkdev_open() right after blkdev_get() for sdb

A simple fix for this is to realize that sync_blockdev() works fine if
you're not holding the mutex.  Also, it's not the end of the world if
you sync a little early (though it can have performance impacts).
Thus we can make a guess that we're going to need to do the sync and
then do it without holding the mutex.  We still do one last sync with
the mutex but it should be much, much faster.

With this, my hung task warnings for my test case are gone.
