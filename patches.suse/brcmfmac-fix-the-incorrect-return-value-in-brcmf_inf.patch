Subject: [PATCH] brcmfmac: fix the incorrect return value in brcmf_inform_single_bss().
Git-commit: bd9944918ceb28ede97f715d209e220db5e92c09
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-13430

The function brcmf_inform_single_bss returns the value as success,
even when the length exceeds the maximum value.
The fix is to send appropriate code on this error.
This issue is observed when Cypress test group reported random fmac
crashes when running their tests and the path was identified from the
crash logs. With this fix the random failure issue in Cypress test group
was resolved.
