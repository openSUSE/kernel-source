Subject: perf/x86/intel: Add a quirk for the calculation of the number of
 counters on Alder Lake
Git-commit: 7fa981cad216e9f64f49e22112f610c0bfed91bc
Patch-mainline: v5.17 or v5.17-rc2 (next release)
References: git-fixes

For some Alder Lake machine with all E-cores disabled in a BIOS, the
below warning may be triggered.

[ 2.010766] hw perf events fixed 5 > max(4), clipping!

Current perf code relies on the CPUID leaf 0xA and leaf 7.EDX[15] to
calculate the number of the counters and follow the below assumption.

For a hybrid configuration, the leaf 7.EDX[15] (X86_FEATURE_HYBRID_CPU)
is set. The leaf 0xA only enumerate the common counters. Linux perf has
to manually add the extra GP counters and fixed counters for P-cores.
For a non-hybrid configuration, the X86_FEATURE_HYBRID_CPU should not
be set. The leaf 0xA enumerates all counters.

However, that's not the case when all E-cores are disabled in a BIOS.
Although there are only P-cores in the system, the leaf 7.EDX[15]
(X86_FEATURE_HYBRID_CPU) is still set. But the leaf 0xA is updated
to enumerate all counters of P-cores. The inconsistency triggers the
warning.

Several software ways were considered to handle the inconsistency.
- Drop the leaf 0xA and leaf 7.EDX[15] CPUID enumeration support.
  Hardcode the number of counters. This solution may be a problem for
  virtualization. A hypervisor cannot control the number of counters
  in a Linux guest via changing the guest CPUID enumeration anymore.
- Find another CPUID bit that is also updated with E-cores disabled.
  There may be a problem in the virtualization environment too. Because
  a hypervisor may disable the feature/CPUID bit.
- The P-cores have a maximum of 8 GP counters and 4 fixed counters on
  ADL. The maximum number can be used to detect the case.
  This solution is implemented in this patch.
