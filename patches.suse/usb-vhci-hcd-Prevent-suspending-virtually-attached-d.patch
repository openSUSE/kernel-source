Subject: [PATCH] usb: vhci-hcd: Prevent suspending virtually attached devices
Git-commit: e40b984b6c4ce3f80814f39f86f87b2a48f2e662
Patch-mainline: v6.18-rc1
References: git-fixes

The VHCI platform driver aims to forbid entering system suspend when at
least one of the virtual USB ports are bound to an active USB/IP
connection.

However, in some cases, the detection logic doesn't work reliably, i.e.
when all devices attached to the virtual root hub have been already
suspended, leading to a broken suspend state, with unrecoverable resume.

Ensure the virtually attached devices do not enter suspend by setting
the syscore PM flag.  Note this is currently limited to the client side
only, since the server side doesn't implement system suspend prevention.
