Subject: x86/cpu: Align cpu_caps_cleared and cpu_caps_set to unsigned long
Git-commit: f6a892ddd53e555362dbf64d31b47fde0f550ec4
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-12677

cpu_caps_cleared[] and cpu_caps_set[] are arrays of type u32 and therefore
naturally aligned to 4 bytes, which is also unsigned long aligned on
32-bit, but not on 64-bit.

The array pointer is handed into atomic bit operations. If the access not
aligned to unsigned long then the atomic bit operations can end up crossing
a cache line boundary, which causes the CPU to do a full bus lock as it
can't lock both cache lines at once. The bus lock operation is heavy weight
and can cause severe performance degradation.

The upcoming #AC split lock detection mechanism will issue warnings for
this kind of access.

Force the alignment of these arrays to unsigned long. This avoids the
massive code changes which would be required when converting the array data
type to unsigned long.
