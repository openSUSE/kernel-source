Subject: [PATCH 09/11] net: hdlc: In hdlc_rcv, check to make sure dev is an
 HDLC device
Git-commit: 01c4ceae0a38a0bdbfea6896f41efcd985a9c064
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc1
References: git-fixes

The hdlc_rcv function is used as hdlc_packet_type.func to process any
skb received in the kernel with skb->protocol == htons(ETH_P_HDLC).
The purpose of this function is to provide second-stage processing for
skbs not assigned a "real" L3 skb->protocol value in the first stage.

This function assumes the device from which the skb is received is an
HDLC device (a device created by this module). It assumes that
netdev_priv(dev) returns a pointer to "struct hdlc_device".

However, it is possible that some driver in the kernel (not necessarily
in our control) submits a received skb with skb->protocol ==
htons(ETH_P_HDLC), from a non-HDLC device. In this case, the skb would
still be received by hdlc_rcv. This will cause problems.

hdlc_rcv should be able to recognize and drop invalid skbs. It should
first make sure "dev" is actually an HDLC device, before starting its
processing. This patch adds this check to hdlc_rcv.
