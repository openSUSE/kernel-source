Subject: [PATCH] Revert "nfc/nci: Add the inconsistency check between the input data length and count"
Git-commit: f40ddcc0c0ca1a0122a7f4440b429f97d5832bdf
Patch-mainline: v6.19-rc7
References: git-fixes

This reverts commit 068648aab72c9ba7b0597354ef4d81ffaac7b979.

NFC packets may have NUL-bytes. Checking for string length is not a correct
assumption here. As long as there is a check for the length copied from
copy_from_user, all should be fine.

The fix only prevented the syzbot reproducer from triggering the bug
because the packet is not enqueued anymore and the code that triggers the
bug is not exercised.

The fix even broke
testing/selftests/nci/nci_dev, making all tests there fail. After the
revert, 6 out of 8 tests pass.
