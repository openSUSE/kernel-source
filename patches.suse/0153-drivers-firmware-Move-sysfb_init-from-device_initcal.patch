Subject: drivers/firmware: Move sysfb_init() from device_initcall to
 subsys_initcall_sync
Git-commit: 60aebc9559492cea6a9625f514a8041717e3a2e4
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc1
References: jsc#PED-3527 jsc#PED-5475 jsc#PED-6068 jsc#PED-6070 jsc#PED-6116 jsc#PED-6120 jsc#PED-5065 jsc#PED-5477 jsc#PED-5511 jsc#PED-6041 jsc#PED-6069 jsc#PED-6071

Consider a configuration like this:
1, efifb (or simpledrm) is built-in;
2, a native display driver (such as radeon) is also built-in.

As Javier said, this is not a common configuration (the native display
driver is usually built as a module), but it can happen and cause some
trouble.

In this case, since efifb, radeon and sysfb are all in device_initcall()
level, the order in practise is like this:

efifb registered at first, but no "efi-framebuffer" device yet. radeon
registered later, and /dev/fb0 created. sysfb_init() comes at last, it
registers "efi-framebuffer" and then causes an error message "efifb: a
framebuffer is already registered". Make sysfb_init() to be subsys_
initcall_sync() can avoid this. And Javier Martinez Canillas is trying
to make a more general solution in commit 873eb3b11860 ("fbdev: Disable
sysfb device registration when removing conflicting FBs").

However, this patch still makes sense because it can make the screen
display as early as possible (We cannot move to subsys_initcall, since
sysfb_init() should be executed after PCI enumeration).
