Subject: PCI: hv: Fix a timing issue which causes kdump to fail occasionally
Git-commit: d6af2ed29c7c1c311b96dac989dcb991e90ee195
References: bsc#1172871, git-fixes

Kdump could fail sometime on Hyper-V guest because the retry in
hv_pci_enter_d0() releases child device structures in hv_pci_bus_exit().

Although there is a second asynchronous device relations message sending
from the host, if this message arrives to the guest after
hv_send_resource_allocated() is called, the retry would fail.

Fix the problem by moving retry to hv_pci_probe() and start the retry
from hv_pci_query_relations() call.  This will cause a device relations
message to arrive to the guest synchronously; the guest would then be
able to rebuild the child device structures before calling
hv_send_resource_allocated().
