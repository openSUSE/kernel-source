Subject: rbd: drop extra rbd_img_request_get
Patch-mainline: Never, it fixes SUSE-specific code that has never been
   merged upstream
References: bsc#1045596

Upstream commit 4a17dadcae55 ("rbd: move bumping img_request refcount into
rbd_obj_request_submit()") has modified rbd_obj_request_submit() to do a
get img_request.

This however introduced a regression in function tcm_rbd_execute_cmp_and_write
as it is calling rbd_img_cmp_and_write_request_fill (which does an
rbd_img_request_get()) followed by rbd_img_request_submit, which will
eventually invoke rbd_obj_request_submit.
