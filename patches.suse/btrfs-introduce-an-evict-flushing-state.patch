Subject: btrfs: introduce an evict flushing state
Git-commit: d3984c90414a36af581b3b7c0daa87f9de3c0533
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: bsc#1141456

We have this weird space flushing loop inside inode.c for evict where
we'll do the normal LIMIT flush, and then commit the transaction and
hope we get our space.  This is super janky, and in fact there's really
nothing stopping us from using FLUSH_ALL except that we run delayed
iputs, which means we could deadlock.  So introduce a new flush state
for eviction that does the normal priority flushing with all of the
states that are safe for eviction.

The nice side-effect of this is that we'll try harder for evictions.
Previously if (for example generic/269) you had a bunch of other
operations happening on the fs you could race with those reservations
when committing the transaction, and eventually miss getting a
reservation for the evict.  With this code we'll have our ticket in
place through the transaction commit, so any pinned bytes will go to our
pending evictions first.
