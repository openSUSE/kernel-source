Subject: mm, meminit: recalculate pcpu batch and high limits after init
 completes
Git-commit: 3e8fc0075e24338b1117cdff6a79477427b8dbed
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc7
References: bnc#1155628 bnc#1151927 5.3.11

Deferred memory initialisation updates zone->managed_pages during the
initialisation phase but before that finishes, the per-cpu page
allocator (pcpu) calculates the number of pages allocated/freed in
batches as well as the maximum number of pages allowed on a per-cpu
list.  As zone->managed_pages is not up to date yet, the pcpu
initialisation calculates inappropriately low batch and high values.

This increases zone lock contention quite severely in some cases with
the degree of severity depending on how many CPUs share a local zone and
the size of the zone.  A private report indicated that kernel build
times were excessive with extremely high system CPU usage.  A perf
profile indicated that a large chunk of time was lost on zone->lock
contention.

This patch recalculates the pcpu batch and high values after deferred
initialisation completes for every populated zone in the system.  It was
tested on a 2-socket AMD EPYC 2 machine using a kernel compilation
workload -- allmodconfig and all available CPUs.

mmtests configuration: config-workload-kernbench-max Configuration was
modified to build on a fresh XFS partition.

The patch reduces system CPU usage by 69.86% and total build time by
26.65%.  The variance of system CPU usage is also much reduced.

Before, this was the breakdown of batch and high values over all zones
was:

    256               batch: 1
    256               batch: 63
    512               batch: 7
    256               high:  0
    256               high:  378
    512               high:  42

512 pcpu pagesets had a batch limit of 7 and a high limit of 42.  After
the patch:

    256               batch: 1
    768               batch: 63
    256               high:  0
    768               high:  378
