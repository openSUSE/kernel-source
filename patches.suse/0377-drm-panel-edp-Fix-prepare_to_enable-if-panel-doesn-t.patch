Subject: drm/panel-edp: Fix "prepare_to_enable" if panel doesn't handle HPD
Git-commit: a64ad9c3e4a53257a13aefe33741aad46e7b34de
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

While cleaning up the descriptions of the delay for eDP panels I
realized that we'd have a bug if any panels need the
"prepare_to_enable" but HPD handling isn't happening in the panel
driver. Let's put in a stopgap to at least make us not violate
timings. This is not perfectly optimal but trying to do better is
hard. At the moment only 2 panels specify this delay and only 30 ms is
at stake. These panels are also currently hooked up with "hpd-gpios"
so effectively this "fix" is just a theoretical fix and won't actually
do anything for any devices currently supported in mainline.
