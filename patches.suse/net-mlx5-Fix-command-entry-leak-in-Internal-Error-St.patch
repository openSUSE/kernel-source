Subject: net/mlx5: Fix command entry leak in Internal Error State
Git-commit: cece6f432cca9f18900463ed01b97a152a03600a
Patch-mainline: 5.7-rc5
References: networking-stable-20_05_12

Processing commands by cmd_work_handler() while already in Internal
Error State will result in entry leak, since the handler process force
completion without doorbell. Forced completion doesn't release the entry
and event completion will never arrive, so entry should be released.

Fixes: 73dd3a4839c1 ("net/mlx5: Avoid using pending command interface slots")
