Subject: [PATCH] NFSD: Retransmit callbacks after client reconnects
Git-commit: 43b02dba110e63e5f8180248920032422ac8c1e4
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: git-fixes

NFSv4.1 clients assume that if they disconnect, that will force the
server to resend pending callback operations once a fresh connection
has been established.

Turns out NFSD has not been resending after reconnect.

Fixes: 7ba6cad6c88f ("nfsd: New helper nfsd4_cb_sequence_done() for processing more cb errors")
