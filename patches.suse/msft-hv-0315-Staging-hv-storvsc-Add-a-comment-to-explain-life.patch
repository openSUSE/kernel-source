+ * We can get incoming messages from the host that are not in response to
+ * messages that we have sent out. An example of this would be messages
+ * received by the guest to notify dynamic addition/removal of LUNs. To
+ * deal with potential race conditions where the driver may be in the
+ * midst of being unloaded when we might receive an unsolicited message
+ * from the host, we have implemented a mechanism to gurantee sequential
+ * consistency:
+ *
+ * 1) Once the device is marked as being destroyed, we will fail all
+ *    outgoing messages.
+ * 2) We permit incoming messages when the device is being destroyed,
+ *    only to properly account for messages already sent out.
