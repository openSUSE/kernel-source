Subject: [PATCH] net: phy: Avoid multiple suspends
Git-commit: 503ba7c6961034ff0047707685644cad9287c226
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc4
References: git-fixes

It is currently possible for a PHY device to be suspended as part of a
network device driver's suspend call while it is still being attached to
that net_device, either via phy_suspend() or implicitly via phy_stop().

Later on, when the MDIO bus controller get suspended, we would attempt
to suspend again the PHY because it is still attached to a network
device.

This is both a waste of time and creates an opportunity for improper
clock/power management bugs to creep in.
