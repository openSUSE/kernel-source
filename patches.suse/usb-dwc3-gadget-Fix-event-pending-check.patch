Subject: [PATCH] usb: dwc3: gadget: Fix event pending check
Git-commit: 7441b273388b9a59d8387a03ffbbca9d5af6348c
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc7

The DWC3_EVENT_PENDING flag is used to protect against invalid call to
top-half interrupt handler, which can occur when there's a delay in
software detection of the interrupt line deassertion.

However, the clearing of this flag was done prior to unmasking the
interrupt line, creating opportunity where the top-half handler can
come. This breaks the serialization and creates a race between the
top-half and bottom-half handler, resulting in losing synchronization
between the controller and the driver when processing events.

To fix this, make sure the clearing of the DWC3_EVENT_PENDING is done at
the end of the bottom-half handler.
