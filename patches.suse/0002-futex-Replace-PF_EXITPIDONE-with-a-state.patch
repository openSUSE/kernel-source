Subject: [PATCH 02/11] futex: Replace PF_EXITPIDONE with a state
Git-commit: 3d4775df0a89240f671861c6ab6e8d59af8e9e41 
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: bsc#1149032

The futex exit handling relies on PF_ flags. That's suboptimal as it
requires a smp_mb() and an ugly lock/unlock of the exiting tasks pi_lock in
the middle of do_exit() to enforce the observability of PF_EXITING in the
futex code.

Add a futex_state member to task_struct and convert the PF_EXITPIDONE logic
over to the new state. The PF_EXITING dependency will be cleaned up in a
later step.

This prepares for handling various futex exit issues later.

+ * - do_exit() from the recursive fault handling path.
+ *
+ * In case of a recursive fault this is best effort. Either the futex exit
