Subject: x86/apic: Mark _all_ legacy interrupts when IO/APIC is missing
Git-commit: 7d65f9e80646c595e8c853640a9d0768a33e204c
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc5
References: bsc#1152489

PIC interrupts do not support affinity setting and they can end up on
any online CPU. Therefore, it's required to mark the associated vectors
as system-wide reserved. Otherwise, the corresponding irq descriptors
are copied to the secondary CPUs but the vectors are not marked as
assigned or reserved. This works correctly for the IO/APIC case.

When the IO/APIC is disabled via config, kernel command line or lack of
enumeration then all legacy interrupts are routed through the PIC, but
nothing marks them as system-wide reserved vectors.

As a consequence, a subsequent allocation on a secondary CPU can result in
allocating one of these vectors, which triggers the BUG() in
apic_update_vector() because the interrupt descriptor slot is not empty.

Imran tried to work around that by marking those interrupts as allocated
when a CPU comes online. But that's wrong in case that the IO/APIC is
available and one of the legacy interrupts, e.g. IRQ0, has been switched to
PIC mode because then marking them as allocated will fail as they are
already marked as system vectors.

Stay consistent and update the legacy vectors after attempting IO/APIC
initialization and mark them as system vectors in case that no IO/APIC is
available.
