Subject: [PATCH] xhci: retry Stop Endpoint on buggy NEC controllers
Git-commit: fd9d55d190c0e5fefd3a9165ea361809427885a1
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1

Two NEC uPD720200 adapters have been observed to randomly misbehave:
a Stop Endpoint command fails with Context Error, the Output Context
indicates Stopped state, and the endpoint keeps running. Very often,
Set TR Dequeue Pointer is seen to fail next with Context Error too,
in addition to problems from unexpectedly completed cancelled work.

The pathology is common on fast running isoc endpoints like uvcvideo,
but has also been reproduced on a full-speed bulk endpoint of pl2303.
It seems all EPs are affected, with risk proportional to their load.

Reproduction involves receiving any kind of stream and closing it to
make the device driver cancel URBs already queued in advance.

Deal with it by retrying the command like in the Running state.
