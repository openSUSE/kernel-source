Subject: bpf, docs: Prune all references to "internal BPF"
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
Git-commit: 06edc59c1fd7aababc8361655b20f4cc9870aef2
References: jsc#PED-1368

The eBPF name has completely taken over from eBPF in general usage for
the actual eBPF representation, or BPF for any general in-kernel use.
Prune all remaining references to "internal BPF".
