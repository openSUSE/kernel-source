From: Olaf Hering <olh@suse.de>
Patch-mainline: not yet

Keep track about which network interface names were renamed after the
network device driver printed its banner. Example insanity:

honeydew:~ # dmesg| grep -Ew '(eth[0-9]|rename|renamed)'
e1000: eth0: e1000_probe: Intel(R) PRO/1000 Network Connection
e1000: eth1: e1000_probe: Intel(R) PRO/1000 Network Connection
e1000: eth2: e1000_probe: Intel(R) PRO/1000 Network Connection
e1000: eth3: e1000_probe: Intel(R) PRO/1000 Network Connection
dev_change_name: about to rename 'eth3' to 'eth0'
dev_change_name: about to rename 'eth3' to 'ethxx3'
eth3 renamed to ethxx3
dev_change_name: about to rename 'ethxx3' to 'eth0'
dev_change_name: about to rename 'eth0' to 'eth3'
eth0 renamed to eth3
dev_change_name: about to rename 'eth1' to 'eth2'
dev_change_name: about to rename 'eth1' to 'ethxx1'
eth1 renamed to ethxx1
dev_change_name: about to rename 'ethxx1' to 'eth2'
dev_change_name: about to rename 'eth2' to 'eth1'
eth2 renamed to eth1
dev_change_name: about to rename 'ethxx3' to 'eth0'
ethxx3 renamed to eth0
dev_change_name: about to rename 'ethxx1' to 'eth2'
ethxx1 renamed to eth2
e1000: eth0: e1000_watchdog_task: NIC Link is Up 100 Mbps Full Duplex
