Commit 747668dbc061 ("usb-storage: Set virt_boundary_mask to avoid SG
overflows") attempted to solve a problem involving scatter-gather I/O
and USB/IP by setting the virt_boundary_mask for mass-storage devices.

However, it now turns out that this interacts badly with commit
09324d32d2a0 ("block: force an unlimited segment size on queues with a
virt boundary"), which was added later.  A typical error message is:

	ehci-pci 0000:00:13.2: swiotlb buffer is full (sz: 327680 bytes),
	total 32768 (slots), used 97 (slots)

There is no longer any reason to keep the virt_boundary_mask setting
for usb-storage.  It was needed in the first place only for handling
devices with a block size smaller than the maxpacket size and where
the host controller was not capable of fully general scatter-gather
operation (that is, able to merge two SG segments into a single USB
packet).  But:

	High-speed or slower connections never use a bulk maxpacket
	value larger than 512;

	The SCSI layer does not handle block devices with a block size
	smaller than 512 bytes;

	All the host controllers capable of SuperSpeed operation can
	handle fully general SG;

	Since commit ea44d190764b ("usbip: Implement SG support to
	vhci-hcd and stub driver") was merged, the USB/IP driver can
	also handle SG.

Therefore all supported device/controller combinations should be okay
with no need for any special virt_boundary_mask.  So in order to fix
the swiotlb problem, this patch reverts commit 747668dbc061.
