Subject: char: xillybus: Refine workqueue handling
Git-commit: ad899c301c880766cc709aad277991b3ab671b66
Patch-mainline: 6.11-rc4
References: CVE-2024-45007 bsc#1230175

As the wakeup work item now runs on a separate workqueue, it needs to be
flushed separately along with flushing the device's workqueue.

Also, move the destroy_workqueue() call to the end of the exit method,
so that deinitialization is done in the opposite order of
initialization.

Fixes: ccbde4b128ef ("char: xillybus: Don't destroy workqueue from work item running on it")
