Subject: [PATCH] staging: comedi: addi_apci_1500: Fix endian problem for command sample
Git-commit: ac0bbf55ed3be75fde1f8907e91ecd2fd589bde3
Patch-mainline: v5.12-rc3
References: git-fixes

The digital input subdevice supports Comedi asynchronous commands that
read interrupt status information.  This uses 16-bit Comedi samples (of
which only the bottom 8 bits contain status information).  However, the
interrupt handler is calling `comedi_buf_write_samples()` with the
address of a 32-bit variable `unsigned int status`.  On a bigendian
machine, this will copy 2 bytes from the wrong end of the variable.  Fix
it by changing the type of the variable to `unsigned short`.
