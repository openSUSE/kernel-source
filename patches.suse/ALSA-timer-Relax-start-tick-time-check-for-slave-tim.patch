Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: timer: Relax start tick time check for slave timer elements
Git-commit: ccbfcac05866ebe6eb3bc6d07b51d4ed4fcde436
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc4
References: git-fixes

The recent addition of a sanity check for a too low start tick time
seems breaking some applications that uses aloop with a certain slave
timer setup.  They may have the initial resolution 0, hence it's
treated as if it were a too low value.

Relax and skip the check for the slave timer instance for addressing
the regression.
