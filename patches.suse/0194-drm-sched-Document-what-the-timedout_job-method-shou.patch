Subject: drm/sched: Document what the timedout_job method should do
Git-commit: 1fad1b7ed1ebfcfb5a1d0d21b0c47f7af5f49a6c
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

The documentation is a bit vague and doesn't really describe what the
->timedout_job() is expected to do. Let's add a few more details.

v5:
* New patch
