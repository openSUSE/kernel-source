Subject: staging: qlge: Update TODO
Git-commit: 88eddb0cce1c654090d94499b7c78085b23b7c2f
References: jsc#PED-11302
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1

Update TODO file to reflect the changes that have been done:
* multiple functions were renamed to have the "qlge_" prefix in commit
  f8c047be5401 ("staging: qlge: use qlge_* prefix to avoid namespace
  clashes with other qlogic drivers")
* a redundant memset() was removed in commit 953b94009377 ("staging: qlge:
  Initialize devlink health dump framework")
* the loop boundary in ql(ge)_alloc_rx_buffers() was updated in commit
  e4c911a73c89 ("staging: qlge: Remove rx_ring.type")
* pci_enable_msi() was replaced in commit 4eab532dca76 ("staging:
  qlge/qlge_main.c: Replace depracated MSI API.")
* pci_dma_* were replaced in commit e955a071b9b3 ("staging: qlge: replace
  deprecated apis pci_dma_*")
* the while loops were rewritten in commit 41e1bf811ace ("Staging: qlge:
  Rewrite two while loops as simple for loops")
* indentation was fixed in commit 0eb79fd1e911 ("staging: qlge: cleanup
  indent in qlge_main.c")

I also slipped in one new TODO item, naughty me!
