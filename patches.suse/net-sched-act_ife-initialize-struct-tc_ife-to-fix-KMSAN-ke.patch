Subject: net: sched: act_ife: initialize struct tc_ife to fix KMSAN
 kernel-infoleak
Git-commit: ce50039be49eea9b4cd8873ca6eccded1b4a130a
Patch-mainline: v6.18-rc6
References: CVE-2025-40278 bsc#1254825

Fix a KMSAN kernel-infoleak detected  by the syzbot .

[net?] KMSAN: kernel-infoleak in __skb_datagram_iter

In tcf_ife_dump(), the variable 'opt' was partially initialized using a
designatied initializer. While the padding bytes are reamined
uninitialized. nla_put() copies the entire structure into a
netlink message, these uninitialized bytes leaked to userspace.

Initialize the structure with memset before assigning its fields
to ensure all members and padding are cleared prior to beign copied.

This change silences the KMSAN report and prevents potential information
leaks from the kernel memory.

This fix has been tested and validated by syzbot. This patch closes the
bug reported at the following syzkaller link and ensures no infoleak.
