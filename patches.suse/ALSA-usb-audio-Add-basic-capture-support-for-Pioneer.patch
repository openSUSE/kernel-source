+	 * PCM is 8 channels out @ 48 fixed (endpoint 0x01)
+	 * and 8 channels in @ 48 fixed (endpoint 0x82).
 	 *
-	 * The input (phono or line to computer) is not working.
-	 * It should be at endpoint 0x82 and probably also 8 channels,
-	 * but it seems that it works only with Pioneer proprietary software.
-	 * Even on officially supported OS, the Audacity was unable to record
-	 * and Mixxx to recognize the control vinyls.
+	 * Both playback and recording is working, even simultaneously.
+	 *
+	 * Playback channels could be mapped to:
+	 *  - CH1
+	 *  - CH2
+	 *  - AUX
+	 *
+	 * Recording channels could be mapped to:
+	 *  - Post CH1 Fader
+	 *  - Post CH2 Fader
+	 *  - Cross Fader A
+	 *  - Cross Fader B
+	 *  - MIC
+	 *  - AUX
+	 *  - REC OUT
+	 *
+	 * There is remaining problem with recording directly from PHONO/LINE.
+	 * If we map a channel to:
+	 *  - CH1 Control Tone PHONO
+	 *  - CH1 Control Tone LINE
+	 *  - CH2 Control Tone PHONO
+	 *  - CH2 Control Tone LINE
+	 * it is silent.
+	 * There is no signal even on other operating systems with official drivers.
+	 * The signal appears only when a supported application is started.
+	 * This needs to be investigated yet...
+	 * (there is quite a lot communication on the USB in both directions)
+	 *
+	 * In current version this mixer could be used for playback
+	 * and for recording from vinyls (through Post CH* Fader)
+	 * but not for DVS (Digital Vinyl Systems) like in Mixxx.
