Subject: block: fix sanity checks in blk_rq_map_user_bvec
Git-commit: 2ff949441802a8d076d9013c7761f63e8ae5a9bd
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc5
References: git-fixes

blk_rq_map_user_bvec contains a check bytes + bv->bv_len > nr_iter which
causes unnecessary failures in NVMe passthrough I/O, reproducible as
follows:

- register a 2 page, page-aligned buffer against a ring
- use that buffer to do a 1 page io_uring NVMe passthrough read

The second (i = 1) iteration of the loop in blk_rq_map_user_bvec will
then have nr_iter == 1 page, bytes == 1 page, bv->bv_len == 1 page, so
the check bytes + bv->bv_len > nr_iter will succeed, causing the I/O to
fail. This failure is unnecessary, as when the check succeeds, it means
we've checked the entire buffer that will be used by the request - i.e.
blk_rq_map_user_bvec should complete successfully. Therefore, terminate
the loop early and return successfully when the check bytes + bv->bv_len
> nr_iter succeeds.

While we're at it, also remove the check that all segments in the bvec
are single-page. While this seems to be true for all users of the
function, it doesn't appear to be required anywhere downstream.
