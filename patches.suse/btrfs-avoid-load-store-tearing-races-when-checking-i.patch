Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: avoid load/store tearing races when checking if an
 inode was logged
Git-commit: 986bf6ed44dff7fbae7b43a0882757ee7f5ba21b
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc5
References: git-fixes

At inode_logged() we do a couple lockless checks for ->logged_trans, and
these are generally safe except the second one in case we get a load or
store tearing due to a concurrent call updating ->logged_trans (either at
btrfs_log_inode() or later at inode_logged()).

In the first case it's safe to compare to the current transaction ID since
once ->logged_trans is set the current transaction, we never set it to a
lower value.

In the second case, where we check if it's greater than zero, we are prone
to load/store tearing races, since we can have a concurrent task updating
to the current transaction ID with store tearing for example, instead of
updating with a single 64 bits write, to update with two 32 bits writes or
four 16 bits writes. In that case the reading side at inode_logged() could
see a positive value that does not match the current transaction and then
return a false negative.

Fix this by doing the second check while holding the inode's spinlock, add
some comments about it too. Also add the data_race() annotation to the
first check to avoid any reports from KCSAN (or similar tools) and comment
about it.
