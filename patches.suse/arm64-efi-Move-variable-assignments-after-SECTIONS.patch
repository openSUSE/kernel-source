Subject: arm64/efi: Move variable assignments after SECTIONS
Git-commit: 90776dd1c427cbb4d381aa4b13338f1fb1d20f5e
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.4

It seems that LLVM's linker does not correctly handle variable assignments
involving section positions that are updated during the SECTIONS
parsing. Commit aa69fb62bea1 ("arm64/efi: Mark __efistub_stext_offset as
an absolute symbol explicitly") ran into this too, but found a different
workaround.

However, this was not enough, as other variables were also miscalculated
which manifested as boot failures under UEFI where __efistub__end was
not taking the correct _end value (they should be the same):

$ ld.lld -EL -maarch64elf --no-undefined -X -shared \
	-Bsymbolic -z notext -z norelro --no-apply-dynamic-relocs \
	-o vmlinux.lld -T poc.lds --whole-archive vmlinux.o && \
  readelf -Ws vmlinux.lld | egrep '\b(__efistub_|)_end\b'
368272: ffff000002218000     0 NOTYPE  LOCAL  HIDDEN    38 __efistub__end
368322: ffff000012318000     0 NOTYPE  GLOBAL DEFAULT   38 _end

$ aarch64-linux-gnu-ld.bfd -EL -maarch64elf --no-undefined -X -shared \
	-Bsymbolic -z notext -z norelro --no-apply-dynamic-relocs \
	-o vmlinux.bfd -T poc.lds --whole-archive vmlinux.o && \
  readelf -Ws vmlinux.bfd | egrep '\b(__efistub_|)_end\b'
338124: ffff000012318000     0 NOTYPE  LOCAL  DEFAULT  ABS __efistub__end
383812: ffff000012318000     0 NOTYPE  GLOBAL DEFAULT 15325 _end

To work around this, all of the __efistub_-prefixed variable assignments
need to be moved after the linker script's SECTIONS entry. As it turns
out, this also solves the problem fixed in commit aa69fb62bea1, so those
changes are reverted here.
