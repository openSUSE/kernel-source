Subject: [PATCH] kthread_worker: split code for canceling the delayed work
 timer
Git-commit: 34b3d5344719d14fd2185b2d9459b3abcb8cf9d8
Patch-mainline: v5.13
References: bsc#1187867

Patch series "kthread_worker: Fix race between kthread_mod_delayed_work()
and kthread_cancel_delayed_work_sync()".

This patchset fixes the race between kthread_mod_delayed_work() and
kthread_cancel_delayed_work_sync() including proper return value
handling.

This patch (of 2):

Simple code refactoring as a preparation step for fixing a race between
kthread_mod_delayed_work() and kthread_cancel_delayed_work_sync().

It does not modify the existing behavior.
