Subject: [PATCH] bcache: avoid oversize memory allocation by small stripe_size
Git-commit: baf8fb7e0e5ec54ea0839f0c534f2cdcd79bea9c
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc3
References: jsc#PED-7513

Arraies bcache->stripe_sectors_dirty and bcache->full_dirty_stripes are
used for dirty data writeback, their sizes are decided by backing device
capacity and stripe size. Larger backing device capacity or smaller
stripe size make these two arraies occupies more dynamic memory space.

Currently bcache->stripe_size is directly inherited from
queue->limits.io_opt of underlying storage device. For normal hard
drives, its limits.io_opt is 0, and bcache sets the corresponding
stripe_size to 1TB (1<<31 sectors), it works fine 10+ years. But for
devices do declare value for queue->limits.io_opt, small stripe_size
(comparing to 1TB) becomes an issue for oversize memory allocations of
bcache->stripe_sectors_dirty and bcache->full_dirty_stripes, while the
capacity of hard drives gets much larger in recent decade.

For example a raid5 array assembled by three 20TB hardrives, the raid
device capacity is 40TB with typical 512KB limits.io_opt. After the math
calculation in bcache code, these two arraies will occupy 400MB dynamic
memory. Even worse Andrea Tomassetti reports that a 4KB limits.io_opt is
declared on a new 2TB hard drive, then these two arraies request 2GB and
512MB dynamic memory from kzalloc(). The result is that bcache device
always fails to initialize on his system.

To avoid the oversize memory allocation, bcache->stripe_size should not
directly inherited by queue->limits.io_opt from the underlying device.
This patch defines BCH_MIN_STRIPE_SZ (4MB) as minimal bcache stripe size
and set bcache device's stripe size against the declared limits.io_opt
value from the underlying storage device,
- If the declared limits.io_opt > BCH_MIN_STRIPE_SZ, bcache device will
  set its stripe size directly by this limits.io_opt value.
- If the declared limits.io_opt < BCH_MIN_STRIPE_SZ, bcache device will
  set its stripe size by a value multiplying limits.io_opt and euqal or
  large than BCH_MIN_STRIPE_SZ.

Then the minimal stripe size of a bcache device will always be >= 4MB.
For a 40TB raid5 device with 512KB limits.io_opt, memory occupied by
bcache->stripe_sectors_dirty and bcache->full_dirty_stripes will be 50MB
in total. For a 2TB hard drive with 4KB limits.io_opt, memory occupied
by these two arraies will be 2.5MB in total.

Such mount of memory allocated for bcache->stripe_sectors_dirty and
bcache->full_dirty_stripes is reasonable for most of storage devices.
