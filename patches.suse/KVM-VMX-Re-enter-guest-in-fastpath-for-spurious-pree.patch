Subject: [PATCH] KVM: VMX: Re-enter guest in fastpath for "spurious"
 preemption timer exits

Re-enter the guest in the fast path if VMX preeemption timer VM-Exit was
"spurious", i.e. if KVM "soft disabled" the timer by writing -1u and by
some miracle the timer expired before any other VM-Exit occurred.  This is
just an intermediate step to cleaning up the preemption timer handling,
optimizing these types of spurious VM-Exits is not interesting as they are
extremely rare/infrequent.
