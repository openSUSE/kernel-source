Subject: [PATCH] clk: mvebu: cp110 add CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED to pcie_x10, pcie_x11 & pcie_x4
Git-commit: f0e6bc0c3ef4b4afb299bd6912586cafd5d864e9
Patch-mainline: v6.19-rc1
References: stable-fixes

CP110 based platforms rely on the bootloader for pci port
initialization.
TF-A actively prevents non-uboot re-configuration of pci lanes, and many
boards do not have software control over the pci card reset.

If a pci port had link at boot-time and the clock is stopped at a later
point, the link fails and can not be recovered.

PCI controller driver probe - and by extension ownership of a driver for
the pci clocks - may be delayed especially on large modular kernels,
causing the clock core to start disabling unused clocks.

Add the CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED flag to the three pci port's clocks to ensure
they are not stopped before the pci controller driver has taken
ownership and tested for an existing link.

This fixes failed pci link detection when controller driver probes late,
e.g. with arm64 defconfig and CONFIG_PHY_MVEBU_CP110_COMPHY=m.
