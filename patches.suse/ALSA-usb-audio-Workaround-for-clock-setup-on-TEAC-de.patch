Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: usb-audio: Workaround for clock setup on TEAC devices
Git-commit: 5ce0b06ae5e69e23142e73c5c3c0260e9f2ccb4b
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: git-fixes

Maris reported that TEAC UD-501 (0644:8043) doesn't work with the
typical "clock source 41 is not valid, cannot use" errors on the
recent kernels.  The currently known workaround so far is to restore
(partially) what we've done unconditionally at the clock setup;
namely, re-setup the USB interface immediately after the clock is
changed.  This patch re-introduces the behavior conditionally for TEAC
devices.

Further notes:
- The USB interface shall be set later in
  snd_usb_endpoint_configure(), but this seems to be too late.
- Even calling  usb_set_interface() right after
  sne_usb_init_sample_rate() doesn't help; so this must be related
  with the clock validation, too.
- The device may still spew the "clock source 41 is not valid" error
  at the first clock setup.  This seems happening at the very first
  try of clock setup, but it disappears at later attempts.
  The error is likely harmless because the driver retries the clock
  setup (such an error is more or less expected on some devices).
