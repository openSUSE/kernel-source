Subject: ring-buffer: Fix recursion protection transitions between interrupt
 context
Git-commit: b02414c8f045ab3b9afc816c3735bc98c5c3d262
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc3
References: git-fixes

The recursion protection of the ring buffer depends on preempt_count() to be
correct. But it is possible that the ring buffer gets called after an
interrupt comes in but before it updates the preempt_count(). This will
trigger a false positive in the recursion code.

Use the same trick from the ftrace function callback recursion code which
uses a "transition" bit that gets set, to allow for a single recursion for
to handle transitions between contexts.

  * The least significant bit can be cleared this way, and it
