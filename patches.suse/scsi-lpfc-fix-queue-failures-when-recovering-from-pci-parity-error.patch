Subject: scsi: lpfc: Fix queue failures when recovering from PCI parity error
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mkp/scsi.git
Git-commit: df0101197c4d9596682901631f3ee193ed354873
References: bsc#1197675 bsc#1196478

When recovering from a pci-parity error the driver is failing to re-create
queues, causing recovery to fail. Looking deeper, it was found that the
interrupt vector count allocated on the recovery was fewer than the vectors
originally allocated. This disparity resulted in CPU map entries with stale
information. When the driver tries to re-create the queues, it attempts to
use the stale information which indicates an eq/interrupt vector that was
no longer created.

Fix by clearng the cpup map array before enabling and requesting the IRQs
in the lpfc_sli_reset_slot_s4 routine().
