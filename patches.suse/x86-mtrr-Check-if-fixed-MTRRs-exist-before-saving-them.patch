Subject: x86/mtrr: Check if fixed MTRRs exist before saving them
Git-commit: 919f18f961c03d6694aa726c514184f2311a4614
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc3
References: git-fixes CVE-2024-44948 bsc#1230174

MTRRs have an obsolete fixed variant for fine grained caching control
of the 640K-1MB region that uses separate MSRs. This fixed variant has
a separate capability bit in the MTRR capability MSR.

So far all x86 CPUs which support MTRR have this separate bit set, so it
went unnoticed that mtrr_save_state() does not check the capability bit
before accessing the fixed MTRR MSRs.

Though on a CPU that does not support the fixed MTRR capability this
results in a #GP.  The #GP itself is harmless because the RDMSR fault is
handled gracefully, but results in a WARN_ON().

Add the missing capability check to prevent this.
