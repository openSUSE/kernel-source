Subject: scsi: storvsc: setup 1:1 mapping between hardware queue and CPU queue
Git-commit: 0ed8810276907c8a633dc8cecc48dabb6678cd23
References: fate#323887

storvsc doesn't use a dedicated hardware queue for a given CPU queue. When
issuing I/O, it selects returning CPU (hardware queue) dynamically based on
vmbus channel usage across all channels.

This patch advertises num_present_cpus() as number of hardware queues. This
will have upper layer setup 1:1 mapping between hardware queue and CPU
queue and avoid unnecessary locking when issuing I/O.
