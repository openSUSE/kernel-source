Subject: drm/i915/guc: Extend deregistration fence to schedule disable
Git-commit: 1f5cdb06b1d3ea6238c807acd91e5ec59f1098d3
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

Extend the deregistration context fence to fence whne a GuC context has
scheduling disable pending.

v2:
 (John H)
  - Update comment why we check the pin count within spin lock
