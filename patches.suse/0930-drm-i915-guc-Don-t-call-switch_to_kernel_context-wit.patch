Subject: drm/i915/guc: Don't call switch_to_kernel_context with GuC submission
Git-commit: 3633242927101b4bcff14cb0f718ecd4d346c5b1
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

Calling switch_to_kernel_context isn't needed if the engine PM reference
is taken while all user contexts are pinned as if don't have PM ref that
guarantees that all user contexts scheduling is disabled. By not calling
switch_to_kernel_context we save on issuing a request to the engine.

v2:
 (Daniel Vetter)
  - Add FIXME comment about pushing switch_to_kernel_context to backend
v3:
 (John Harrison)
  - Update commit message
  - Fix workding comment
