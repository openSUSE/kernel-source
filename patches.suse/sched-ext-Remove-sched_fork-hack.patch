Subject: [PATCH] sched/ext: Remove sched_fork() hack

References: bsc#1234634 (Scheduler functional and performance backports)
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
Git-commit: 0f0d1b8e5010bfe1feeb4d78d137e41946a5370d

Instead of solving the underlying problem of the double invocation of
__sched_fork() for idle tasks, sched-ext decided to hack around the issue
by partially clearing out the entity struct to preserve the already
enqueued node. A provided analysis and solution has been ignored for four
months.

Now that someone else has taken care of cleaning it up, remove the
disgusting hack and clear out the full structure. Remove the comment in the
structure declaration as well, as there is no requirement for @node being
the last element anymore.

Fixes: f0e1a0643a59 ("sched_ext: Implement BPF extensible scheduler class")
