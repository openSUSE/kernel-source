Subject: ext4: fix warning in ext4_dio_write_end_io()
Git-commit: 619f75dae2cf117b1d07f27b046b9ffb071c4685
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc6
References: bsc#1219163

The syzbot has reported that it can hit the warning in
ext4_dio_write_end_io() because i_size < i_disksize. Indeed the
reproducer creates a race between DIO IO completion and truncate
expanding the file and thus ext4_dio_write_end_io() sees an inconsistent
inode state where i_disksize is already updated but i_size is not
updated yet. Since we are careful when setting up DIO write and consider
it extending (and thus performing the IO synchronously with i_rwsem held
exclusively) whenever it goes past either of i_size or i_disksize, we
can use the same test during IO completion without risking entering
ext4_handle_inode_extension() without i_rwsem held. This way we make it
obvious both i_size and i_disksize are large enough when we report DIO
completion without relying on unreliable WARN_ON.
