Subject: vgacon: Propagate console boot parameters before calling `vc_resize'
Git-commit: 3dfac26e2ef29ff2abc2a75aa4cd48fce25a2c4b
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc4
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

Fix a division by zero in `vgacon_resize' with a backtrace like:

vgacon_resize
vc_do_resize
vgacon_init
do_bind_con_driver
do_unbind_con_driver
fbcon_fb_unbind
do_unregister_framebuffer
do_register_framebuffer
register_framebuffer
__drm_fb_helper_initial_config_and_unlock
drm_helper_hpd_irq_event
dw_hdmi_irq
irq_thread
kthread

caused by `c->vc_cell_height' not having been initialized.  This has
only started to trigger with commit 860dafa90259 ("vt: Fix character
height handling with VT_RESIZEX"), however the ultimate offender is
commit 50ec42edd978 ("[PATCH] Detaching fbcon: fix vgacon to allow
retaking of the console").

Said commit has added a call to `vc_resize' whenever `vgacon_init' is
called with the `init' argument set to 0, which did not happen before.
And the call is made before a key vgacon boot parameter retrieved in
`vgacon_startup' has been propagated in `vgacon_init' for `vc_resize' to
use to the console structure being worked on.  Previously the parameter
was `c->vc_font.height' and now it is `c->vc_cell_height'.

In this particular scenario the registration of fbcon has failed and vt
resorts to vgacon.  Now fbcon does have initialized `c->vc_font.height'
somehow, unlike `c->vc_cell_height', which is why this code did not
crash before, but either way the boot parameters should have been copied
to the console structure ahead of the call to `vc_resize' rather than
afterwards, so that first the call has a chance to use them and second
they do not change the console structure to something possibly different
from what was used by `vc_resize'.

Move the propagation of the vgacon boot parameters ahead of the call to
`vc_resize' then.  Adjust the comment accordingly.
