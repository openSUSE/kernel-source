Subject: [PATCH] fs: direct-io: fix missing sdio->boundary
Git-commit: df41872b68601059dd4a84858952dcae58acd331
Patch-mainline: v5.12-rc7
References: bsc#1184736

I encountered a hung task issue, but not a performance one.  I run DIO
on a device (need lba continuous, for example open channel ssd), maybe
hungtask in below case:

  DIO:						Checkpoint:
  get addr A(at boundary), merge into BIO,
  no submit because boundary missing
						flush dirty data(get addr A+1), wait IO(A+1)
						writeback timeout, because DIO(A) didn't submit
  get addr A+2 fail, because checkpoint is doing

dio_send_cur_page() may clear sdio->boundary, so prevent it from missing
a boundary.
