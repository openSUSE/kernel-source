Subject: drm/bridge: Add connector-related bridge operations and data
Git-commit: 11f6c4b1b2599d04ae94a25ce3dcdc46d19434b0
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-12680, jsc#SLE-12880, jsc#SLE-12882, jsc#SLE-12883, jsc#SLE-13496, jsc#SLE-15322

To support implementation of DRM connectors on top of DRM bridges
instead of by bridges, the drm_bridge needs to expose new operations and
data:

- Output detection, hot-plug notification, mode retrieval and EDID
  retrieval operations
- Bitmask of supported operations
- Bridge output type
- I2C adapter for DDC access

Add and document these.

Three new bridge helper functions are also added to handle hot plug
notification in a way that is as transparent as possible for the
bridges.

+ * - The connector-related operations support implementing a &drm_connector
+ *   based on a chain of bridges. DRM bridges traditionally create a
+ *   &drm_connector for bridges meant to be used at the end of the chain. This
+ *   puts additional burden on bridge drivers, especially for bridges that may
+ *   be used in the middle of a chain or at the end of it. Furthermore, it
+ *   requires all operations of the &drm_connector to be handled by a single
+ *   bridge, which doesn't always match the hardware architecture.
+ *
+ *   To simplify bridge drivers and make the connector implementation more
+ *   flexible, a new model allows bridges to unconditionally skip creation of
+ *   &drm_connector and instead expose &drm_bridge_funcs operations to support
+ *   an externally-implemented &drm_connector. Those operations are
+ *   &drm_bridge_funcs.detect, &drm_bridge_funcs.get_modes,
+ *   &drm_bridge_funcs.get_edid, &drm_bridge_funcs.hpd_notify,
+ *   &drm_bridge_funcs.hpd_enable and &drm_bridge_funcs.hpd_disable. When
+ *   implemented, display drivers shall create a &drm_connector instance for
+ *   each chain of bridges, and implement those connector instances based on
+ *   the bridge connector operations.
+ *
+ *   Bridge drivers shall implement the connector-related operations for all
+ *   the features that the bridge hardware support. For instance, if a bridge
+ *   supports reading EDID, the &drm_bridge_funcs.get_edid shall be
+ *   implemented. This however doesn't mean that the DDC lines are wired to the
+ *   bridge on a particular platform, as they could also be connected to an I2C
+ *   controller of the SoC. Support for the connector-related operations on the
+ *   running platform is reported through the &drm_bridge.ops flags. Bridge
+ *   drivers shall detect which operations they can support on the platform
+ *   (usually this information is provided by ACPI or DT), and set the
+ *   &drm_bridge.ops flags for all supported operations. A flag shall only be
+ *   set if the corresponding &drm_bridge_funcs operation is implemented, but
+ *   an implemented operation doesn't necessarily imply that the corresponding
+ *   flag will be set. Display drivers shall use the &drm_bridge.ops flags to
+ *   decide which bridge to delegate a connector operation to. This mechanism
+ *   allows providing a single static const &drm_bridge_funcs instance in
+ *   bridge drivers, improving security by storing function pointers in
