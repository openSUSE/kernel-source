Subject: [PATCH] ata: libata: Set DID_TIME_OUT for commands that actually timed out
Git-commit: 8e59a2a5459fd9840dbe2cbde85fe154b11e1727
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc5
References: git-fixes

When ata_qc_complete() schedules a command for EH using
ata_qc_schedule_eh(), blk_abort_request() will be called, which leads to
req->q->mq_ops->timeout() / scsi_timeout() being called.

scsi_timeout(), if the LLDD has no abort handler (libata has no abort
handler), will set host byte to DID_TIME_OUT, and then call
scsi_eh_scmd_add() to add the command to EH.

Thus, when commands first enter libata's EH strategy_handler, all the
commands that have been added to EH will have DID_TIME_OUT set.

Commit e5dd410acb34 ("ata: libata: Clear DID_TIME_OUT for ATA PT commands
with sense data") clears this bogus DID_TIME_OUT flag for all commands
that reached libata's EH strategy_handler.

libata has its own flag (AC_ERR_TIMEOUT), that it sets for commands that
have not received a completion at the time of entering EH.

ata_eh_worth_retry() has no special handling for AC_ERR_TIMEOUT, so by
default timed out commands will get flag ATA_QCFLAG_RETRY set, and will be
retried after the port has been reset (ata_eh_link_autopsy() always
triggers a port reset if any command has AC_ERR_TIMEOUT set).

For a command that has ATA_QCFLAG_RETRY set, while also having an error
flag set (e.g. AC_ERR_TIMEOUT), ata_eh_finish() will not increment
scmd->allowed, so the command will at most be retried scmd->allowed number
of times (which by default is set to 3).

However, scsi_eh_flush_done_q() will only retry commands for which
scsi_noretry_cmd() returns false.

For a command that has DID_TIME_OUT set, while also having either the
FAILFAST flag set, or the command being a passthrough command,
scsi_noretry_cmd() will return true. Thus, such a command will never be
retried.

Thus, make sure that libata sets SCSI's DID_TIME_OUT flag for commands that
actually timed out (libata's AC_ERR_TIMEOUT flag), such that timed out
commands will once again not be retried if they are also a FAILFAST or
passthrough command.
