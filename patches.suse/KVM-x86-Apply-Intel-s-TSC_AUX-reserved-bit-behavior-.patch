Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: Apply Intel's TSC_AUX reserved-bit behavior to
 Intel compat vCPUs

Extend Intel's check on MSR_TSC_AUX[63:32] to all vCPU models that are
Intel compatible, i.e. aren't AMD or Hygon in KVM's world, as the behavior
is architectural, i.e. applies to any CPU that is compatible with Intel's
architecture.  Applying the behavior strictly to Intel wasn't intentional,
KVM simply didn't have a concept of "Intel compatible" as of commit
61a05d444d2c ("KVM: x86: Tie Intel and AMD behavior for MSR_TSC_AUX to
guest CPU model").
