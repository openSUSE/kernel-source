Subject: bpf: Fix mismatched RCU unlock flavour in bpf_out_neigh_v6
Patch-mainline: v6.12
Git-commit: fb86c42a2a5d44e849ddfbc98b8d2f4f40d36ee3
References: git-fixes

In the bpf_out_neigh_v6 function, rcu_read_lock() is used to begin an RCU
read-side critical section. However, when unlocking, one branch
incorrectly uses a different RCU unlock flavour rcu_read_unlock_bh()
instead of rcu_read_unlock(). This mismatch in RCU locking flavours can
lead to unexpected behavior and potential concurrency issues.

This possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developed
by myself, specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues.

This patch corrects the mismatched unlock flavour by replacing the
incorrect rcu_read_unlock_bh() with the appropriate rcu_read_unlock(),
ensuring that the RCU critical section is properly exited. This change
prevents potential synchronization issues and aligns with proper RCU
usage patterns.
