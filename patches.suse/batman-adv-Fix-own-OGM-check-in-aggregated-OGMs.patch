Subject: [PATCH] batman-adv: Fix own OGM check in aggregated OGMs
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-transfer-encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: d8bf0c01642275c7dca1e5d02c34e4199c200b1f
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc4
References: git-fixes

The own OGM check is currently misplaced and can lead to the following
Issues: 

For one thing we might receive an aggregated OGM from a neighbor node
which has our own OGM in the first place. We would then not only skip
our own OGM but erroneously also any other, following OGM in the
aggregate.

For another, we might receive an OGM aggregate which has our own OGM in
a place other then the first one. Then we would wrongly not skip this
OGM, leading to populating the orginator and gateway table with ourself.
