Subject: [PATCH] fscrypt: add fscrypt_is_nokey_name()
Git-commit: 159e1de201b6fca10bfec50405a3b53a561096a8
Patch-mainline: v5.11-rc1
References: bsc#1182446

It's possible to create a duplicate filename in an encrypted directory
by creating a file concurrently with adding the encryption key.

Specifically, sys_open(O_CREAT) (or sys_mkdir(), sys_mknod(), or
sys_symlink()) can lookup the target filename while the directory's
encryption key hasn't been added yet, resulting in a negative no-key
dentry.  The VFS then calls ->create() (or ->mkdir(), ->mknod(), or
->symlink()) because the dentry is negative.  Normally, ->create() would
return -ENOKEY due to the directory's key being unavailable.  However,
if the key was added between the dentry lookup and ->create(), then the
filesystem will go ahead and try to create the file.

If the target filename happens to already exist as a normal name (not a
no-key name), a duplicate filename may be added to the directory.

In order to fix this, we need to fix the filesystems to prevent
->create(), ->mkdir(), ->mknod(), and ->symlink() on no-key names.
(->rename() and ->link() need it too, but those are already handled
correctly by fscrypt_prepare_rename() and fscrypt_prepare_link().)

In preparation for this, add a helper function fscrypt_is_nokey_name()
that filesystems can use to do this check.  Use this helper function for
the existing checks that fs/crypto/ does for rename and link.

+/**
+ * fscrypt_is_nokey_name() - test whether a dentry is a no-key name
+ * @dentry: the dentry to check
+ *
+ * This returns true if the dentry is a no-key dentry.  A no-key dentry is a
+ * dentry that was created in an encrypted directory that hasn't had its
+ * encryption key added yet.  Such dentries may be either positive or negative.
+ *
+ * When a filesystem is asked to create a new filename in an encrypted directory
+ * and the new filename's dentry is a no-key dentry, it must fail the operation
+ * with ENOKEY.  This includes ->create(), ->mkdir(), ->mknod(), ->symlink(),
+ * ->rename(), and ->link().  (However, ->rename() and ->link() are already
+ * handled by fscrypt_prepare_rename() and fscrypt_prepare_link().)
+ *
+ * This is necessary because creating a filename requires the directory's
+ * encryption key, but just checking for the key on the directory inode during
+ * the final filesystem operation doesn't guarantee that the key was available
+ * during the preceding dentry lookup.  And the key must have already been
+ * available during the dentry lookup in order for it to have been checked
+ * whether the filename already exists in the directory and for the new file's
+ * dentry not to be invalidated due to it incorrectly having the no-key flag.
+ *
+ * Return: %true if the dentry is a no-key name
