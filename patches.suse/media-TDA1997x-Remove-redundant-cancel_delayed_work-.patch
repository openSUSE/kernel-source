Subject: [PATCH] media: TDA1997x: Remove redundant cancel_delayed_work in probe
Git-commit: 29de195ca39fc2ac0af6fd45522994df9f431f80
Patch-mainline: v6.19-rc1
References: git-fixes

The delayed_work delayed_work_enable_hpd is initialized with
INIT_DELAYED_WORK(), but it is never scheduled in tda1997x_probe().

Calling cancel_delayed_work() on a work that has never been
scheduled is redundant and unnecessary, as there is no pending
work to cancel.

Remove the redundant cancel_delayed_work() from error handling
path in tda1997x_probe() to avoid potential confusion.
