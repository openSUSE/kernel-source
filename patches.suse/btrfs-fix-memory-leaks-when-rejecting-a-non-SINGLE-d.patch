Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: fix memory leaks when rejecting a non SINGLE data
 profile without an RST
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Git-commit: fec9b9d3ced39f16be8d7afdf81f4dd2653da319
Patch-mainline: v6.18-rc2
References: CVE-2025-40101 bsc#1252901

At the end of btrfs_load_block_group_zone_info() the first thing we do
is to ensure that if the mapping type is not a SINGLE one and there is
no RAID stripe tree, then we return early with an error.

Doing that, though, prevents the code from running the last calls from
this function which are about freeing memory allocated during its
run. Hence, in this case, instead of returning early, we set the ret
value and fall through the rest of the cleanup code.
