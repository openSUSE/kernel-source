Subject: x86/speculation: Fix prctl() when spectre_v2_user={seccomp,prctl},ibpb
Git-commit: 33fc379df76b4991e5ae312f07bcd6820811971e
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc6
References: bsc#1152489

When spectre_v2_user={seccomp,prctl},ibpb is specified on the command
line, IBPB is force-enabled and STIPB is conditionally-enabled (or not
available).

However, since

  21998a351512 ("x86/speculation: Avoid force-disabling IBPB based on STIBP and enhanced IBRS.")

the spectre_v2_user_ibpb variable is set to SPECTRE_V2_USER_{PRCTL,SECCOMP}
instead of SPECTRE_V2_USER_STRICT, which is the actual behaviour.
Because the issuing of IBPB relies on the switch_mm_*_ibpb static
branches, the mitigations behave as expected.

Since

  1978b3a53a74 ("x86/speculation: Allow IBPB to be conditionally enabled on CPUs with always-on STIBP")

this discrepency caused the misreporting of IB speculation via prctl().

On CPUs with STIBP always-on and spectre_v2_user=seccomp,ibpb,
prctl(PR_GET_SPECULATION_CTRL) would return PR_SPEC_PRCTL |
PR_SPEC_ENABLE instead of PR_SPEC_DISABLE since both IBPB and STIPB are
always on. It also allowed prctl(PR_SET_SPECULATION_CTRL) to set the IB
speculation mode, even though the flag is ignored.

Similarly, for CPUs without SMT, prctl(PR_GET_SPECULATION_CTRL) should
also return PR_SPEC_DISABLE since IBPB is always on and STIBP is not
available.
