Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: qgroup: don't try to wait flushing if we're already
 holding a transaction
Git-commit: ae5e070eaca9dbebde3459dd8f4c2756f8c097d0
Patch-mainline: v5.11-rc3
References: bsc#1179575

There is a chance of racing for qgroup flushing which may lead to
deadlock:

	Thread A		|	Thread B
   (not holding trans handle)	|  (holding a trans handle)
--------------------------------+--------------------------------
__btrfs_qgroup_reserve_meta()   | __btrfs_qgroup_reserve_meta()
|- try_flush_qgroup()		| |- try_flush_qgroup()
   |- QGROUP_FLUSHING bit set   |    |
   |				|    |- test_and_set_bit()
   |				|    |- wait_event()
   |- btrfs_join_transaction()	|
   |- btrfs_commit_transaction()|

			!!! DEAD LOCK !!!

Since thread A wants to commit transaction, but thread B is holding a
transaction handle, blocking the commit.
At the same time, thread B is waiting for thread A to finish its commit.

This is just a hot fix, and would lead to more EDQUOT when we're near
the qgroup limit.

The proper fix would be to make all metadata/data reservations happen
without holding a transaction handle.
