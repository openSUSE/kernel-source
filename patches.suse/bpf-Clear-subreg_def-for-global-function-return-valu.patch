Subject: bpf: Clear subreg_def for global function return values
Patch-mainline: v5.12-rc1
Git-commit: 45159b27637b0fef6d5ddb86fc7c46b13c77960f
References: bsc#1177028

test_global_func4 fails on s390 as reported by Yauheni in [1].

The immediate problem is that the zext code includes the instruction,
whose result needs to be zero-extended, into the zero-extension
patchlet, and if this instruction happens to be a branch, then its
delta is not adjusted. As a result, the verifier rejects the program
later.

However, according to [2], as far as the verifier's algorithm is
concerned and as specified by the insn_no_def() function, branching
insns do not define anything. This includes call insns, even though
one might argue that they define %r0.

This means that the real problem is that zero extension kicks in at
all. This happens because clear_caller_saved_regs() sets BPF_REG_0's
subreg_def after global function calls. This can be fixed in many
ways; this patch mimics what helper function call handling already
does.
