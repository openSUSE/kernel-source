Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: check the right error variable in
 btrfs_del_dir_entries_in_log

With my new locking code dbench is so much faster that I tripped over a
transaction abort from ENOSPC.  This turned out to be because
btrfs_del_dir_entries_in_log was checking for ret == -ENOSPC, but this
function sets err on error, and returns err.  So instead of properly
marking the inode as needing a full commit, we were returning -ENOSPC
and aborting in __btrfs_unlink_inode.  Fix this by checking the proper
variable so that we return the correct thing in the case of ENOSPC.

The ENOENT needs to be checked, because btrfs_lookup_dir_item_index()
can return -ENOENT if the dir item isn't in the tree log (which would
happen if we hadn't fsync'ed this guy).  We actually handle that case in
__btrfs_unlink_inode, so it's an expected error to get back.

Fixes: 4a500fd178c8 ("Btrfs: Metadata ENOSPC handling for tree log")
