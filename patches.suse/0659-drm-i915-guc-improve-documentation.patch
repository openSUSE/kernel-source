Subject: drm/i915/guc: improve documentation
Git-commit: 218151e997449717cbb70f304b7b8f9918ba6af4
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: bsc#1152489

Add a short description of what we expect from GuC and some minor
improvements to existing documentation. Also remove a comment about a
difference between GuC and HuC that is not true anymore.

v2: add that the GuC is not mandatory (Martin)
v3: add extra newline for better text organization (Martin)

+ * DOC: GuC
+ *
+ * The GuC is a microcontroller inside the GT HW, introduced in gen9. The GuC is
+ * designed to offload some of the functionality usually performed by the host
+ * driver; currently the main operations it can take care of are:
+ *
+ * - Authentication of the HuC, which is required to fully enable HuC usage.
+ * - Low latency graphics context scheduling (a.k.a. GuC submission).
+ * - GT Power management.
+ *
+ * The enable_guc module parameter can be used to select which of those
+ * operations to enable within GuC. Note that not all the operations are
+ * supported on all gen9+ platforms.
+ *
+ * Enabling the GuC is not mandatory and therefore the firmware is only loaded
+ * if at least one of the operations is selected. However, not loading the GuC
+ * might result in the loss of some features that do require the GuC (currently
+ * just the HuC, but more are expected to land in the future).
