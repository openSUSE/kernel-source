Subject: RDMA/umem: Add a schedule point in ib_umem_get()
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc1
Git-commit: 928da37a229f344424ffc89c9a58feb2368bb018
References: jsc#SLE-15176

Mapping as little as 64GB can take more than 10 seconds, triggering issues
on kernels with CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE=y.

ib_umem_get() already splits the work in 2MB units on x86_64, adding a
cond_resched() in the long-lasting loop is enough to solve the issue.

Note that sg_alloc_table() can still use more than 100 ms, which is also
problematic. This might be addressed later in ib_umem_add_sg_table(),
adding new blocks in sgl on demand.
