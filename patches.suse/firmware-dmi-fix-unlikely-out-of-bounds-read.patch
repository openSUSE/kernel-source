Subject: firmware: dmi: Fix unlikely out-of-bounds read in save_mem_devices
Git-commit: 81dde26de9c08bb04c4962a15608778aaffb3cf9
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc4
References: git-fixes

Before reading the Extended Size field, we should ensure it fits in
the DMI record. There is already a record length check but it does
not cover that field.

It would take a seriously corrupted DMI table to hit that bug, so no
need to worry, but we should still fix it.
