Subject: [PATCH] Revert "dmaengine: qcom_hidma: Check for driver register failure"
Git-commit: 43ed0fcf613a87dd0221ec72d1ade4d6544f2ffc
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc3
References: git-fixes

This reverts commit a474b3f0428d6b02a538aa10b3c3b722751cb382.

Because of recent interactions with developers from @umn.edu, all
commits from them have been recently re-reviewed to ensure if they were
correct or not.

Upon review, this commit was found to be incorrect for the reasons
below, so it must be reverted.  It will be fixed up "correctly" in a
later kernel change.

The original change is NOT correct, as it does not correctly unwind from
the resources that was allocated before the call to
platform_driver_register().
