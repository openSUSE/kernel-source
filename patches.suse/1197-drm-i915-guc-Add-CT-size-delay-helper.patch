Subject: drm/i915/guc: Add CT size delay helper
Git-commit: ff0dac080a8555eb3e95573c5ccaec4ac3ca63de
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: jsc#PED-3527 jsc#PED-5475 jsc#PED-6068 jsc#PED-6070 jsc#PED-6116 jsc#PED-6120 jsc#PED-5065 jsc#PED-5477 jsc#PED-5511 jsc#PED-6041 jsc#PED-6069 jsc#PED-6071

As of now, there is no mechanism for tracking a given request's
progress through the queue.  Instead, add a helper that returns
an estimated maximum time the queue should take to drain if
completely full.
