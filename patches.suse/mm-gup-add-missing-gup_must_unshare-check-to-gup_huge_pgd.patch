Subject: [PATCH] mm/gup: add missing gup_must_unshare() check to
 gup_huge_pgd()

References: bsc#1212886 (MM functional and performance backports)
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc1
Git-commit: 311150343e69ed4fe6380d2de74602a2a29df7c2

All other instances of gup_huge_pXd() perform the unshare check, so update
the PGD-specific function to do so as well.

While checking pgd_write() might seem unusual, this function already
performs such a check via pgd_access_permitted() so this is in line with
the existing implementation.

David said:

: This change makes unshare handling across all GUP-fast variants
: consistent, which is desirable as GUP-fast is complicated enough
: already even when consistent.
:
: This function was the only one I seemed to have missed (or left out and
: forgot why -- maybe because it's really dead code for now).  The COW
: selftest would identify the problem, so far there was no report.
: Either the selftest wasn't run on corresponding architectures with that
: hugetlb size, or that code is still dead code and unused by
: architectures.
:
: the original commit(s) that added unsharing explain why we care about
: these checks:
:
: a7f226604170acd6 ("mm/gup: trigger FAULT_FLAG_UNSHARE when R/O-pinning a possibly shared anonymous page")
: 84209e87c6963f92 ("mm/gup: reliable R/O long-term pinning in COW mappings")
