Subject: [PATCH] KEYS: trusted: Do not use WARN when encode fails
Git-commit: 050bf3c793a07f96bd1e2fd62e1447f731ed733b
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc1
References: git-fixes CVE-2024-36975 bsc#1226520

When asn1_encode_sequence() fails, WARN is not the correct solution.

1. asn1_encode_sequence() is not an internal function (located
   in lib/asn1_encode.c).
2. Location is known, which makes the stack trace useless.
3. Results a crash if panic_on_warn is set.

It is also noteworthy that the use of WARN is undocumented, and it
should be avoided unless there is a carefully considered rationale to
use it.

Replace WARN with pr_err, and print the return value instead, which is
only useful piece of information.
