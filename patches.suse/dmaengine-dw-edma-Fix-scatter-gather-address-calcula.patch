Subject: [PATCH] dmaengine: dw-edma: Fix scatter-gather address calculation
Git-commit: 05655541c9503bfd01af4e6cbd7f5a29ac748e6c
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc4
References: git-fixes

Fix the source and destination physical address calculation of a
peripheral device on scatter-gather implementation.

This issue manifested during tests using a 64 bits architecture system.
The abnormal behavior wasn't visible before due to all previous tests
were done using 32 bits architecture system, that masked his effect.
