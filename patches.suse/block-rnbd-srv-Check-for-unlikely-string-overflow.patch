Subject: block/rnbd-srv: Check for unlikely string overflow
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
Git-commit: 9e4bf6a08d1e127bcc4bd72557f2dfafc6bc7f41
References: bsc#1221615 CVE-2023-52618

Since "dev_search_path" can technically be as large as PATH_MAX,
there was a risk of truncation when copying it and a second string
into "full_path" since it was also PATH_MAX sized. The W=1 builds were
reporting this warning:

drivers/block/rnbd/rnbd-srv.c: In function 'process_msg_open.isra':
drivers/block/rnbd/rnbd-srv.c:616:51: warning: '%s' directive output may be truncated writing up to 254 bytes into a region of size between 0 and 4095 [-Wformat-truncation=]
  616 |                 snprintf(full_path, PATH_MAX, "%s/%s",
      |                                                   ^~

    inlined from 'process_msg_open.isra' at drivers/block/rnbd/rnbd-srv.c:721:14: drivers/block/rnbd/rnbd-srv.c:616:17: note: 'snprintf' output between 2 and 4351 bytes into a destination of size 4096
  616 |                 snprintf(full_path, PATH_MAX, "%s/%s",
      |                 ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  617 |                          dev_search_path, dev_name);
      |                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To fix this, unconditionally check for truncation (as was already done
for the case where "%SESSNAME%" was present).
