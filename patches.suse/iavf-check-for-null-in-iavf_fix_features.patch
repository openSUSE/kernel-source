Subject: iavf: check for null in iavf_fix_features
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc2
Git-commit: 8a4a126f4be88eb8b5f00a165ab58c35edf4ef76
References: git-fixes

If the driver has lost contact with the PF then it enters a disabled state
and frees adapter->vf_res. However, ndo_fix_features can still be called on
the interface, so we need to check for this condition first. Since we have
no information on the features at this time simply leave them unmodified
and return.

Fixes: c4445aedfe09 ("i40evf: Fix VLAN features")
