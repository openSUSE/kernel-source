Subject: CIFS: avoid using MID 0xFFFF
Git-commit: 03d9a9fe3f3aec508e485dd3dcfa1e99933b4bdb
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc5
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.8

According to MS-CIFS specification MID 0xFFFF should not be used by the
CIFS client, but we actually do. Besides, this has proven to cause races
leading to oops between SendReceive2/cifs_demultiplex_thread. On SMB1,
MID is a 2 byte value easy to reach in CurrentMid which may conflict with
an oplock break notification request coming from server
