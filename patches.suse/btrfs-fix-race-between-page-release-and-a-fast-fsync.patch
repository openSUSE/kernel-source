Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: fix race between page release and a fast fsync

When releasing an extent map, done through the page release callback, we
can race with an ongoing fast fsync and cause the fsync to miss a new
extent and not log it. The steps for this to happen are the following:

1) A page is dirtied for some inode I;

2) Writeback for that page is triggered by a path other than fsync, for
   example by the system due to memory pressure;

3) When the ordered extent for the extent (a single 4K page) finishes,
   we unpin the corresponding extent map and set its generation to N,
   the current transaction's generation;

4) The btrfs_releasepage() callback is invoked by the system due to
   memory pressure for that no longer dirty page of inode I;

5) At the same time, some task calls fsync on inode I, joins transaction
   N, and at btrfs_log_inode() it sees that the inode does not have the
   full sync flag set, so we proceed with a fast fsync. But before we get
   into btrfs_log_changed_extents() and lock the inode's extent map tree:

6) Through btrfs_releasepage() we end up at try_release_extent_mapping()
   and we remove the extent map for the new 4Kb extent, because it is
   neither pinned anymore nor locked. By calling remove_extent_mapping(),
   we remove the extent map from the list of modified extents, since the
   extent map does not have the logging flag set. We unlock the inode's
   extent map tree;

7) The task doing the fast fsync now enters btrfs_log_changed_extents(),
   locks the inode's extent map tree and iterates its list of modified
   extents, which no longer has the 4Kb extent in it, so it does not log
   the extent;

8) The fsync finishes;

9) Before transaction N is committed, a power failure happens. After
   replaying the log, the 4K extent of inode I will be missing, since
   it was not logged due to the race with try_release_extent_mapping().

So fix this by teaching try_release_extent_mapping() to not remove an
extent map if it's still in the list of modified extents.
