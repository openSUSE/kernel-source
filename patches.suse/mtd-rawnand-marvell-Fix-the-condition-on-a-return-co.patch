Subject: [PATCH] mtd: rawnand: marvell: Fix the condition on a return code
Git-commit: c27075772d1f1c8aaf276db9943b35adda8a8b65
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
References: git-fixes

In a previous fix, I changed the condition on which the timeout of an
IRQ is reached from:

    if (!ret)

Into: 

    if (ret && !pending)

While having a non-zero return code is usual in the Linux kernel, here
ret comes from a wait_for_completion_timeout() which returns 0 when
the waiting period is too long.

Hence, the revised condition should be:

    if (!ret && !pending)

The faulty patch did not produce any error because of the !pending
condition so this change is finally purely cosmetic and does not
change the actual driver behavior.
