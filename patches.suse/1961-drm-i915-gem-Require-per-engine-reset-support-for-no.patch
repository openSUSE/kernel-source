Subject: drm/i915/gem: Require per-engine reset support for non-persistent
Git-commit: dea8d5ce46d7e7f7270b9804df7d1174f88bfd99
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc3
References: jsc#SLE-12680, jsc#SLE-12880, jsc#SLE-12882, jsc#SLE-12883, jsc#SLE-13496, jsc#SLE-15322
 contexts

To enable non-persistent contexts, we require a means of cancelling any
inflight work from that context. This is first done "gracefully" by
using preemption to kick the active context off the engine, and then
forcefully by resetting the engine if it is active. If we are unable to
reset the engine to remove hostile userspace, we should not allow
userspace to opt into using non-persistent contexts.

If the per-engine reset fails, we still do a full GPU reset, but that is
rare and usually indicative of much deeper issues. The damage is already
done. However, the goal of the interface to allow long running compute
jobs without causing collateral damage elsewhere, and if we are unable
to support that we should make that known by not providing the
interface (and falsely pretending we can).
