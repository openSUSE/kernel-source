Subject: perf/x86/intel: Introduce the fourth fixed counter
Git-commit: 6f7225099d5f3ec3019f380a0da2b456b7796cb0
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-13346

The fourth fixed counter, TOPDOWN.SLOTS, is introduced in Ice Lake to
measure the level 1 TopDown events.

Add MSR address and macros for the new fixed counter, which will be used
in a later patch.

Add comments to explain the event encoding rules for the fixed counters.
