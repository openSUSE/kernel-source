Subject: arm64: dts: marvell: cn9131-cf-solidwan: fix cp1 comphy links
Git-commit: 09cdb973afa7a18ce8e66807daff94609cc4b8a4
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc1
References: git-fixes

Marvell CN913x platforms use common phy framework for configuring and
linking serdes lanes according to their usage.
Each CP (X) features 5 serdes lanes (Y) represented by cpX_comphyY
nodes.

CN9131 SolidWAN uses CP1 serdes lanes 3 and 5 for eth1 and eth2 of CP1
respectively. Devicetree however wrongly links from these ports to the
comphy of CP0.

Replace the wrong links to cp0_comphy with cp1_comphy inside cp1_eth1,
cp1_eth2.
