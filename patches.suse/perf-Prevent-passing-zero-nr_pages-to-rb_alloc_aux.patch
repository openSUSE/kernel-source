Subject: perf: Prevent passing zero nr_pages to rb_alloc_aux()
Git-commit: dbc48c8f41c208082cfa95e973560134489e3309
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
References: git-fixes

nr_pages is unsigned long but gets passed to rb_alloc_aux() as an int,
and is stored as an int.

Only power-of-2 values are accepted, so if nr_pages is a 64_bit value, it
will be passed to rb_alloc_aux() as zero.

That is not ideal because:
 1. the value is incorrect
 2. rb_alloc_aux() is at risk of misbehaving, although it manages to
 return -ENOMEM in that case, it is a result of passing zero to get_order()
 even though the get_order() result is documented to be undefined in that
 case.

Fix by simply validating the maximum supported value in the first place.
Use -ENOMEM error code for consistency with the current error code that
is returned in that case.
