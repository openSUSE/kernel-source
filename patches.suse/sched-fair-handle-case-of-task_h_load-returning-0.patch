Subject: [PATCH] sched/fair: handle case of task_h_load() returning 0

References: bnc#1155798 (CPU scheduler functional and performance backports)
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc6
Git-commit: 01cfcde9c26d8555f0e6e9aea9d6049f87683998

task_h_load() can return 0 in some situations like running stress-ng
mmapfork, which forks thousands of threads, in a sched group on a 224 cores
system. The load balance doesn't handle this correctly because
env->imbalance never decreases and it will stop pulling tasks only after
reaching loop_max, which can be equal to the number of running tasks of
the cfs. Make sure that imbalance will be decreased by at least 1.

misfit task is the other feature that doesn't handle correctly such
situation although it's probably more difficult to face the problem
because of the smaller number of CPUs and running tasks on heterogenous
system.

We can't simply ensure that task_h_load() returns at least one because it
would imply to handle underflow in other places.
