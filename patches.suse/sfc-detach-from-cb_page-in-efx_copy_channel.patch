Subject: sfc: detach from cb_page in efx_copy_channel()
Git-commit: 4b1bd9db078f7d5332c8601a2f5bd43cf0458fd4
Patch-mainline: 5.6-rc6
References: networking-stable-20_03_14

It's a resource, not a parameter, so we can't copy it into the new
 channel's TX queues, otherwise aliasing will lead to resource-
 management bugs if the channel is subsequently torn down without
 being initialised.

Before the Fixes:-tagged commit there was a similar bug with
 tsoh_page, but I'm not sure it's worth doing another fix for such
 old kernels.
