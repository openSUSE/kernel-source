Subject: drm/panic: Add drm panic locking
Git-commit: e2a1cda3e0c784740751d46431973dcee32cf108
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc1
References: jsc#PED-9898 jsc#PED-10191 jsc#PED-10197 jsc#PED-10226 jsc#PED-10237 jsc#PED-10340 jsc#PED-10852 jsc#PED-11022

Rough sketch for the locking of drm panic printing code. The upshot of
this approach is that we can pretty much entirely rely on the atomic
commit flow, with the pair of raw_spin_lock/unlock providing any
barriers we need, without having to create really big critical
sections in code.

This also avoids the need that drivers must explicitly update the
panic handler state, which they might forget to do, or not do
consistently, and then we blow up in the worst possible times.

It is somewhat racy against a concurrent atomic update, and we might
write into a buffer which the hardware will never display. But there's
fundamentally no way to avoid that - if we do the panic state update
explicitly after writing to the hardware, we might instead write to an
old buffer that the user will barely ever see.

Note that an rcu protected deference of plane->state would give us the
the same guarantees, but it has the downside that we then need to
protect the plane state freeing functions with call_rcu too. Which
would very widely impact a lot of code and therefore doesn't seem
worth the complexity compared to a raw spinlock with very tiny
critical sections. Plus rcu cannot be used to protect access to
peek/poke registers anyway, so we'd still need it for those cases.

Peek/poke registers for vram access (or a gart pte reserved just for
panic code) are also the reason I've gone with a per-device and not
per-plane spinlock, since usually these things are global for the
entire display. Going with per-plane locks would mean drivers for such
hardware would need additional locks, which we don't want, since it
deviates from the per-console takeoverlocks design.

Longer term it might be useful if the panic notifiers grow a bit more
structure than just the absolute bare
EXPORT_SYMBOL(panic_notifier_list) - somewhat aside, why is that not
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL ... If panic notifiers would be more like console
drivers with proper register/unregister interfaces we could perhaps
reuse the very fancy console lock with all it's check and takeover
semantics that John Ogness is developing to fix the console_lock mess.
But for the initial cut of a drm panic printing support I don't think
we need that, because the critical sections are extremely small and
only happen once per display refresh. So generally just 60 tiny locked
sections per second, which is nothing compared to a serial console
running a 115kbaud doing really slow mmio writes for each byte. So for
now the raw spintrylock in drm panic notifier callback should be good
enough.

Another benefit of making panic notifiers more like full blown
consoles (that are used in panics only) would be that we get the two
stage design, where first all the safe outputs are used. And then the
dangerous takeover tricks are deployed (where for display drivers we
also might try to intercept any in-flight display buffer flips, which
if we race and misprogram fifos and watermarks can hang the memory
controller on some hw).

For context the actual implementation on the drm side is by Jocelyn
and this patch is meant to be combined with the overall approach in
v7 (v8 is a bit less flexible, which I think is the wrong direction):

https://lore.kernel.org/dri-devel/20240104160301.185915-1-jfalempe@redhat.com/

Note that the locking is very much not correct there, hence this
separate rfc.

Starting from v10, I (Jocelyn) have included this patch in the drm_panic
series, and done the corresponding changes.

v2:
- fix authorship, this was all my typing
- some typo oopsies
- link to the drm panic work by Jocelyn for context

v10:
- Use spinlock_irqsave/restore (John Ogness)

v11:
- Use macro instead of inline functions for drm_panic_lock/unlock (John Ogness)
