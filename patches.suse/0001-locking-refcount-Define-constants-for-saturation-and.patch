Subject: [PATCH 1/9] locking/refcount: Define constants for saturation and max refcount values
Git-commit: 23e6b169c9917fbd77534f8c5f378cb073f548bd
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: bsc#1149032

The REFCOUNT_FULL implementation uses a different saturation point than
the x86 implementation, which means that the shared refcount code in
lib/refcount.c (e.g. refcount_dec_not_one()) needs to be aware of the
difference.

Rather than duplicate the definitions from the lkdtm driver, instead
move them into <linux/refcount.h> and update all references accordingly.
