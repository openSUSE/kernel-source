Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: pcm: disallow linking stream to itself
Mime-version: 1.0

Git-commit: 951e2736f4b11b58dc44d41964fa17c3527d882a
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
References: git-fixes

Prevent SNDRV_PCM_IOCTL_LINK linking stream to itself - the code
can't handle it. Fixed commit is not where bug was introduced, but
changes the context significantly.
