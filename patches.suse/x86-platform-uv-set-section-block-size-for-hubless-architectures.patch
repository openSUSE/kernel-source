Subject: x86/platform/uv: Set section block size for hubless architectures
Git-commit: 6840a150b9daf35e4d21ab9780d0a03b4ed74a5b
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc1
References: bsc#1152489

Commit

  bbbd2b51a2aa ("x86/platform/UV: Use new set memory block size function")

added a call to set the block size value that is needed by the kernel
to set the boundaries in the section list. This was done for UV Hubbed
systems but missed in the UV Hubless setup. Fix that mistake by adding
that same set call for hubless systems, which support the same NVRAMs
and Intel BIOS, thus the same problem occurs.
