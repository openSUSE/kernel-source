The problem is that "channel" is an unsigned int, when it's less 5 the
value of "channel - 5" is not a negative number as one would expect but
is very high positive value instead.

This means that "start" becomes a very high positive value.  The result
of that is that we never enter the "for (i = start; i <= end; i++) {"
loop.  Instead of storing the result from b43legacy_radio_aci_detect()
it just uses zero.
