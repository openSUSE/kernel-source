Subject: s390/futex: Fix FUTEX_OP_ANDN implementation
Git-commit: 26701574cee6777f867f89b4a5c667817e1ee0dd
Patch-mainline: v6.13 or v6.13-rc8 (next release)
References: git-fixes bsc#1236286

The futex operation FUTEX_OP_ANDN is supposed to implement

*(int *)UADDR2 &= ~OPARG;

The s390 implementation just implements an AND instead of ANDN.
Add the missing bitwise not operation to oparg to fix this.

This is broken since nearly 19 years, so it looks like user space is
not making use of this operation.
