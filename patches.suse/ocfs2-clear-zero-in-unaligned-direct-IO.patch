Subject: ocfs2: clear zero in unaligned direct IO
Git-commit: 7a243c82ea527cd1da47381ad9cd646844f3b693
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc3
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.9

Unused portion of a part-written fs-block-sized block is not set to zero
in unaligned append direct write.This can lead to serious data
inconsistencies.

Ocfs2 manage disk with cluster size(for example, 1M), part-written in
one cluster will change the cluster state from UN-WRITTEN to WRITTEN,
VFS(function dio_zero_block) doesn't do the cleaning because bh's state
is not set to NEW in function ocfs2_dio_wr_get_block when we write a
WRITTEN cluster.  For example, the cluster size is 1M, file size is 8k
and we direct write from 14k to 15k, then 12k~14k and 15k~16k will
contain dirty data.

We have to deal with two cases:
 1.The starting position of direct write is outside the file.
 2.The starting position of direct write is located in the file.

We need set bh's state to NEW in the first case.  In the second case, we
need mapped twice because bh's state of area out file should be set to
NEW while area in file not.
