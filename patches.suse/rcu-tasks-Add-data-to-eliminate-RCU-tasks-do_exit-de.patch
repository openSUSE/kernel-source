Subject: [PATCH] rcu-tasks: Add data to eliminate RCU-tasks/do_exit()
 deadlocks
Git-commit: bfe93930ea1ea3c6c115a7d44af6e4fea609067e
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: bsc#1246298

Holding a mutex across synchronize_rcu_tasks() and acquiring
that same mutex in code called from do_exit() after its call to
exit_tasks_rcu_start() but before its call to exit_tasks_rcu_stop()
results in deadlock.  This is by design, because tasks that are far
enough into do_exit() are no longer present on the tasks list, making
it a bit difficult for RCU Tasks to find them, let alone wait on them
to do a voluntary context switch.  However, such deadlocks are becoming
more frequent.  In addition, lockdep currently does not detect such
deadlocks and they can be difficult to reproduce.

In addition, if a task voluntarily context switches during that time
(for example, if it blocks acquiring a mutex), then this task is in an
RCU Tasks quiescent state.  And with some adjustments, RCU Tasks could
just as well take advantage of that fact.

This commit therefore adds the data structures that will be needed
to rely on these quiescent states and to eliminate these deadlocks.
