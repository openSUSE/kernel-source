Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/hdmi: fix failures at PCM open on Intel ICL and later
Git-commit: 56275036d8185f92eceac7479d48b858ee3dab84
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc5
References: git-fixes

When HDMI PCM devices are opened in a specific order, with at least one
HDMI/DP receiver connected, ALSA PCM open fails to -EBUSY on the
connected monitor, on recent Intel platforms (ICL/JSL and newer). While
this is not a typical sequence, at least Pulseaudio does this every time
when it is started, to discover the available PCMs.

The rootcause is an invalid assumption in hdmi_add_pin(), where the
total number of converters is assumed to be known at the time the
function is called. On older Intel platforms this held true, but after
ICL/JSL, the order how pins and converters are in the subnode list as
returned by snd_hda_get_sub_nodes(), was changed. As a result,
information for some converters was not stored to per_pin->mux_nids.
And this means some pins cannot be connected to all converters, and
application instead gets -EBUSY instead at open.

The assumption that converters are always before pins in the subnode
list, is not really a valid one. Fix the problem in hdmi_parse_codec()
by introducing separate loops for discovering converters and pins.
