Subject: drm: remove drm_bridge_hpd_disable() from
 drm_bridge_connector_destroy()
Git-commit: f730e7adfd69d7ac859d8fe4d67e980cbad1e445
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: drm-backport-placeholder

drm_bridge_hpd_enable()/drm_bridge_hpd_disable() callbacks call into
the respective driver's hpd_enable()/hpd_disable() ops. These ops control
the HPD enable/disable logic which in some cases like MSM can be a
dedicate hardware block to control the HPD.

During probe_defer cases, a connector can be initialized and then later
destroyed till the probe is retried. During connector destroy in these
cases, the hpd_disable() callback gets called without a corresponding
hpd_enable() leading to an unbalanced state potentially causing even
a crash.

This can be avoided by the respective drivers maintaining their own
state logic to ensure that a hpd_disable() without a corresponding
hpd_enable() just returns without doing anything.

However, to have a generic fix it would be better to avoid the
hpd_disable() callback from the connector destroy path and let
the hpd_enable() / hpd_disable() balance be maintained by the
corresponding drm_bridge_connector_enable_hpd() /
drm_bridge_connector_disable_hpd() APIs which should get called by
drm_kms_helper_disable_hpd().
