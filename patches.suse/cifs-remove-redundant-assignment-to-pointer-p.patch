Subject: [PATCH] cifs: remove redundant assignment to pointer p
Git-commit: 0b66fa776c361824a700793e34f866bf479dac92
References: bsc#1193629
Patch-mainline: v5.16

The pointer p is being assigned with a value that is never read. The
pointer is being re-assigned a different value inside the do-while
loop. The assignment is redundant and can be removed.
