Subject: net: enetc: don't disable VLAN filtering in IFF_PROMISC mode

Quoting from the blamed commit:

    In promiscuous mode, it is more intuitive that all traffic is received,
    including VLAN tagged traffic. It appears that it is necessary to set
    the flag in PSIPVMR for that to be the case, so VLAN promiscuous mode is
    also temporarily enabled. On exit from promiscuous mode, the setting
    made by ethtool is restored.

Intuitive or not, there isn't any definition issued by a standards body
which says that promiscuity has anything to do with VLAN filtering - it
only has to do with accepting packets regardless of destination MAC address.

In fact people are already trying to use this misunderstanding/bug of
the enetc driver as a justification to transform promiscuity into
something it never was about: accepting every packet (maybe that would
be the "rx-all" netdev feature?):
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20201110153958.ci5ekor3o2ekg3ky@ipetronik.com/

This is relevant because there are use cases in the kernel (such as
tc-flower rules with the protocol 802.1Q and a vlan_id key) which do not
(yet) use the vlan_vid_add API to be compatible with VLAN-filtering NICs
such as enetc, so for those, disabling rx-vlan-filter is currently the
only right solution to make these setups work:
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/CA+h21hoxwRdhq4y+w8Kwgm74d4cA0xLeiHTrmT-VpSaM7obhkg@mail.gmail.com/
The blamed patch has unintentionally introduced one more way for this to
work, which is to enable IFF_PROMISC, however this is non-portable
because port promiscuity is not meant to disable VLAN filtering.
Therefore, it could invite people to write broken scripts for enetc, and
then wonder why they are broken when migrating to other drivers that
don't handle promiscuity in the same way.
