Subject: drm/vc4: hdmi: Create destroy state implementation
Git-commit: 1e9974c7583456ca0bb9ccbf028c86154560f819
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: drm-backport-placeholder

Even though we were rolling our own custom state for the vc4 HDMI
controller driver, we were still using the generic helper to destroy
that state.

It was mostly working since the underlying state is the first member of
our state so the pointers are probably equal in all relevant cases, but
it's still fragile so let's fix this properly.
