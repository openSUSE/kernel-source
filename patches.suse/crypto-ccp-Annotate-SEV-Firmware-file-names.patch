Subject: [PATCH v4] crypto: ccp: Annotate SEV Firmware file names
Patch-mainline: Not yet, submitted upstream
References: bsc#1185282

Annotate the firmware files CCP might need using MODULE_FIRMWARE().
This will get them included into an initrd when CCP is also included
there. Otherwise the CCP module will not find its firmware when loaded
before the root-fs is mounted.
This can cause problems when the pre-loaded SEV firmware is too old to
support current SEV and SEV-ES virtualization features.

Fixes: e93720606efd ("crypto: ccp - Allow SEV firmware to be chosen based on Family and Model")
