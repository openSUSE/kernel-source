Subject: KVM: s390: pv: avoid stalls when making pages secure
Git-commit: f0a1a0615a6ff6d38af2c65a522698fb4bb85df6
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: git-fixes

Improve make_secure_pte to avoid stalls when the system is heavily
overcommitted. This was especially problematic in kvm_s390_pv_unpack,
because of the loop over all pages that needed unpacking.

Due to the locks being held, it was not possible to simply replace
uv_call with uv_call_sched. A more complex approach was
needed, in which uv_call is replaced with __uv_call, which does not
loop. When the UVC needs to be executed again, -EAGAIN is returned, and
the caller (or its caller) will try again.

When -EAGAIN is returned, the path is the same as when the page is in
writeback (and the writeback check is also performed, which is
harmless).
