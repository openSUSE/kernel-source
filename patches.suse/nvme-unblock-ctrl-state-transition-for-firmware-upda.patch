Subject: nvme: unblock ctrl state transition for firmware update
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc6
Git-commit: 650415fca0a97472fdd79725e35152614d1aad76
References: git-fixes

The original nvme subsystem design didn't have a CONNECTING state; the
state machine allowed transitions from RESETTING to LIVE directly.

With the introduction of nvme fabrics the CONNECTING state was
introduce. Over time the nvme-pci started to use the CONNECTING state as
well.

Eventually, a bug fix for the nvme-fc started to depend that the only
valid transition to LIVE was from CONNECTING. Though this change didn't
update the firmware update handler which was still depending on
RESETTING to LIVE transition.

The simplest way to address it for the time being is to switch into
CONNECTING state before going to LIVE state.

Fixes: d2fe192348f9 ("nvme: only allow entering LIVE from CONNECTING state")
