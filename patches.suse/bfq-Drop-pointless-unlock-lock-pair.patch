Subject: [PATCH 5/9] bfq: Drop pointless unlock-lock pair
References: bsc#1197926
Patch-mainline: submitted, in linux-block tree

In bfq_insert_request() we unlock bfqd->lock only to call
trace_block_rq_insert() and then lock bfqd->lock again. This is really
pointless since tracing is disabled if we really care about performance
and even if the tracepoint is enabled, it is a quick call.
