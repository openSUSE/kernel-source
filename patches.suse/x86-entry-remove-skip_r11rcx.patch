Subject: x86/entry: Remove skip_r11rcx
Git-commit: 1b331eeea7b8676fc5dbdf80d0a07e41be226177
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: bsc#1201644

Yes, r11 and rcx have been restored previously, but since they're being
popped anyway (into rsi) might as well pop them into their own regs --
setting them to the value they already are.

Less magical code.
