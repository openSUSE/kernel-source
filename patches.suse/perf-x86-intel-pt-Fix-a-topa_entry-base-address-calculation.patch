Subject: perf/x86/intel/pt: Fix a topa_entry base address calculation
Git-commit: ad97196379d0b8cb24ef3d5006978a6554e6467f
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
References: git-fixes

topa_entry->base is a bit-field. Bit-fields are not promoted to a 64-bit
type, even if the underlying type is 64-bit, and so, if necessary, must
be cast to a larger type when calculations are done.

Fix a topa_entry->base address calculation by adding a cast.

Without the cast, the address was limited to 36-bits i.e. 64GiB.

The address calculation is used on systems that do not support Multiple
Entry ToPA (only Broadwell), and affects physical addresses on or above
64GiB. Instead of writing to the correct address, the address comprising
the first 36 bits would be written to.

Intel PT snapshot and sampling modes are not affected.
