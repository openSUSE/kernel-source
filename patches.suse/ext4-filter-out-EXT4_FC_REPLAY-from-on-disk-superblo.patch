Subject: [PATCH] ext4: filter out EXT4_FC_REPLAY from on-disk superblock field
 s_state
Git-commit: c878bea3c9d724ddfa05a813f30de3d25a0ba83f
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: bsc#1202771 CVE-2022-49348 bsc#1238383

The EXT4_FC_REPLAY bit in sbi->s_mount_state is used to indicate that
we are in the middle of replay the fast commit journal.  This was
actually a mistake, since the sbi->s_mount_info is initialized from
es->s_state.  Arguably s_mount_state is misleadingly named, but the
name is historical --- s_mount_state and s_state dates back to ext2.

What should have been used is the ext4_{set,clear,test}_mount_flag()
inline functions, which sets EXT4_MF_* bits in sbi->s_mount_flags.

The problem with using EXT4_FC_REPLAY is that a maliciously corrupted
superblock could result in EXT4_FC_REPLAY getting set in
s_mount_state.  This bypasses some sanity checks, and this can trigger
a BUG() in ext4_es_cache_extent().  As a easy-to-backport-fix, filter
out the EXT4_FC_REPLAY bit for now.  We should eventually transition
away from EXT4_FC_REPLAY to something like EXT4_MF_REPLAY.
