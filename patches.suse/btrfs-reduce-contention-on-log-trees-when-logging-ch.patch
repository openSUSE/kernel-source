Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: reduce contention on log trees when logging checksums

The possibility of extents being shared (through clone and deduplication
operations) requires special care when logging data checksums, to avoid
having a log tree with different checksum items that cover ranges which
overlap (which resulted in missing checksums after replaying a log tree).
Such problems were fixed in the past by the following commits:

commit 40e046acbd2f ("Btrfs: fix missing data checksums after replaying a
                      log tree")

commit e289f03ea79b ("btrfs: fix corrupt log due to concurrent fsync of
                      inodes with shared extents")

Test case generic/588 exercises the scenario solved by the first commit
(purely sequential and deterministic) while test case generic/457 often
triggered the case fixed by the second commit (not deterministic, requires
specific timings under concurrency).

The problems were addressed by deleting, from the log tree, any existing
checksums before logging the new ones. And also by doing the deletion and
logging of the cheksums while locking the checksum range in an extent io
tree (root->log_csum_range), to deal with the case where we have concurrent
fsyncs against files with shared extents.

That however causes more contention on the leaves of a log tree where we
store checksums (and all the nodes in the paths leading to them), even
when we do not have shared extents, or all the shared extents were created
by past transactions. It also adds a bit of contention on the spin lock of
the log_csums_range extent io tree of the log root.

This change adds a 'last_reflink_trans' field to the inode to keep track
of the last transaction where a new extent was shared between inodes
(through clone and deduplication operations). It is updated for both the
source and destination inodes of reflink operations whenever a new extent
(created in the current transaction) becomes shared by the inodes. This
field is kept in memory only, not persisted in the inode item, similar
to other existing fields (last_unlink_trans, logged_trans).

When logging checksums for an extent, if the value of 'last_reflink_trans'
is smaller then the current transaction's generation/id, we skip locking
the extent range and deletion of checksums from the log tree, since we
know we do not have new shared extents. This reduces contention on the
log tree's leaves where checksums are stored.

The following script, which uses fio, was used to measure the impact of
this change:

  $ cat test-fsync.sh
  #!/bin/bash

  DEV=/dev/sdk
  MNT=/mnt/sdk
  MOUNT_OPTIONS="-o ssd"
  MKFS_OPTIONS="-d single -m single"

  if [ $# -ne 3 ]; then
      echo "Use $0 NUM_JOBS FILE_SIZE FSYNC_FREQ"
      exit 1
  fi

  NUM_JOBS=$1
  FILE_SIZE=$2
  FSYNC_FREQ=$3

  cat <<EOF > /tmp/fio-job.ini
  [writers]
  rw=write
  fsync=$FSYNC_FREQ
  fallocate=none
  group_reporting=1
  direct=0
  bs=64k
  ioengine=sync
  size=$FILE_SIZE
  directory=$MNT
  numjobs=$NUM_JOBS
  EOF

  echo "Using config:"
  echo
  cat /tmp/fio-job.ini
  echo

  mkfs.btrfs -f $MKFS_OPTIONS $DEV
  mount $MOUNT_OPTIONS $DEV $MNT
  fio /tmp/fio-job.ini
  umount $MNT

The tests were performed for different numbers of jobs, file sizes and
fsync frequency. A qemu VM using kvm was used, with 8 cores (the host has
12 cores, with cpu governance set to performance mode on all cores), 16GiB
of ram (the host has 64GiB) and using a NVMe device directly (without an
intermediary filesystem in the host). While running the tests, the host
was not used for anything else, to avoid disturbing the tests.

The obtained results were the following (the last line of fio's output was
pasted). Starting with 16 jobs is where a significant difference is
observable in this particular setup and hardware (differences highlighted
below). The very small differences for tests with less than 16 jobs are
possibly just noise and random.
