Subject: x86/ioapic: Ignore IRQ2 again
Git-commit: a501b048a95b79e1e34f03cac3c87ff1e9f229ad
Patch-mainline: v5.12-rc4
References: bsc#1152489

Vitaly ran into an issue with hotplugging CPU0 on an Amazon instance where
the matrix allocator claimed to be out of vectors. He analyzed it down to
the point that IRQ2, the PIC cascade interrupt, which is supposed to be not
ever routed to the IO/APIC ended up having an interrupt vector assigned
which got moved during unplug of CPU0.

The underlying issue is that IRQ2 for various reasons (see commit
af174783b925 ("x86: I/O APIC: Never configure IRQ2" for details) is treated
as a reserved system vector by the vector core code and is not accounted as
a regular vector. The Amazon BIOS has an routing entry of pin2 to IRQ2
which causes the IO/APIC setup to claim that interrupt which is granted by
the vector domain because there is no sanity check. As a consequence the
allocation counter of CPU0 underflows which causes a subsequent unplug to
fail with:

  [ ... ] CPU 0 has 4294967295 vectors, 589 available. Cannot disable CPU

There is another sanity check missing in the matrix allocator, but the
underlying root cause is that the IO/APIC code lost the IRQ2 ignore logic
during the conversion to irqdomains.

For almost 6 years nobody complained about this wreckage, which might
indicate that this requirement could be lifted, but for any system which
actually has a PIC IRQ2 is unusable by design so any routing entry has no
effect and the interrupt cannot be connected to a device anyway.

Due to that and due to history biased paranoia reasons restore the IRQ2
ignore logic and treat it as non existent despite a routing entry claiming
otherwise.
