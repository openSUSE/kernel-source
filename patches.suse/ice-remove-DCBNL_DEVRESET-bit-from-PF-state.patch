Subject: ice: remove DCBNL_DEVRESET bit from PF state
Patch-mainline: v5.12-rc7
Git-commit: 741b7b743bbcb5a3848e4e55982064214f900d2f
References: jsc#SLE-7926

The original purpose of the ICE_DCBNL_DEVRESET was to protect
the driver during DCBNL device resets.  But, the flow for
DCBNL device resets now consists of only calls up the stack
such as dev_close() and dev_open() that will result in NDO calls
to the driver.  These will be handled with state changes from the
stack.  Also, there is a problem of the dev_close and dev_open
being blocked by checks for reset in progress also using the
ICE_DCBNL_DEVRESET bit.

Since the ICE_DCBNL_DEVRESET bit is not necessary for protecting
the driver from DCBNL device resets and it is actually blocking
changes coming from the DCBNL interface, remove the bit from the
PF state and don't block driver function based on DCBNL reset in
progress.
