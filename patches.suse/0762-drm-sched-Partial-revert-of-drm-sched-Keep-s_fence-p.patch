Subject: drm/sched: Partial revert of 'drm/sched: Keep s_fence->parent
 pointer'

Git-commit: 45ecaea738830b9d521c93520c8f201359dcbd95
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225 jsc#PED-2849

Problem:
This patch caused negative refcount as described in [1] because
for that case parent fence did not signal by the time of drm_sched_stop and hence
kept in pending list the assumption was they will not signal and
so fence was put to account for the s_fence->parent refcount but for
amdgpu which has embedded HW fence (always same parent fence)
drm_sched_fence_release_scheduled was always called and would
still drop the count for parent fence once more. For jobs that
never signaled this imbalance was masked by refcount bug in
amdgpu_fence_driver_clear_job_fences that would not drop
refcount on the fences that were removed from fence drive
fences array (against prevois insertion into the array in
get in amdgpu_fence_emit).

Fix:
Revert this patch and by setting s_job->s_fence->parent to NULL
as before prevent the extra refcount drop in amdgpu when
drm_sched_fence_release_scheduled is called on job release.

Also - align behaviour in drm_sched_resubmit_jobs_ext with that of
drm_sched_main when submitting jobs - take a refcount for the
new parent fence pointer and drop refcount for original kref_init
for new HW fence creation (or fake new HW fence in amdgpu - see next patch).
