Subject: btrfs: don't force read-only after error in drop snapshot
Git-commit: 7c09c03091ac562ddca2b393e5d65c1d37da79f1
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
References: bsc#1176354

Deleting a subvolume on a full filesystem leads to ENOSPC followed by a
forced read-only. This is not a transaction abort and the filesystem is
otherwise ok, so the error should be just propagated to the callers.

This is caused by unnecessary call to btrfs_handle_fs_error for all
errors, except EAGAIN. This does not make sense as the standard
transaction abort mechanism is in btrfs_drop_snapshot so all relevant
failures are handled.

Originally in commit cb1b69f4508a ("Btrfs: forced readonly when
btrfs_drop_snapshot() fails") there was no return value at all, so the
btrfs_std_error made some sense but once the error handling and
propagation has been implemented we don't need it anymore.
