Subject: [PATCH] platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Drop HP Stream x360 Convertible PC 11 from allow-list
Git-commit: 070222731be52d741e55d8967b1764482b81e54c
Patch-mainline: v5.11-rc5
References: git-fixes

THe HP Stream x360 Convertible PC 11 DSDT has the following VGBS function:

            Method (VGBS, 0, Serialized)
            {
                If ((^^PCI0.LPCB.EC0.ROLS == Zero))
                {
                    VBDS = Zero
                }
                Else
                {
                    VBDS = Zero
                }

                Return (VBDS) /* \_SB_.VGBI.VBDS */
            }

Which is obviously wrong, because it always returns 0 independent of the
2-in-1 being in laptop or tablet mode. This causes the intel-vbtn driver
to initially report SW_TABLET_MODE = 1 to userspace, which is known to
cause problems when the 2-in-1 is actually in laptop mode.

During earlier testing this turned out to not be a problem because the
2-in-1 would do a Notify(..., 0xCC) or Notify(..., 0xCD) soon after
the intel-vbtn driver loaded, correcting the SW_TABLET_MODE state.

Further testing however has shown that this Notify() soon after the
intel-vbtn driver loads, does not always happen. When the Notify
does not happen, then intel-vbtn reports SW_TABLET_MODE = 1 resulting in
a non-working touchpad.

IOW the tablet-mode reporting is not reliable on this device, so it
should be dropped from the allow-list, fixing the touchpad sometimes
not working.
