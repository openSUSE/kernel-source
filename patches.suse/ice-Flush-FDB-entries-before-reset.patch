Subject: ice: Flush FDB entries before reset
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc3
Git-commit: fbcb968a98ac0b71f5a2bda2751d7a32d201f90d
References: git-fixes

Triggering the reset while in switchdev mode causes
errors[1]. Rules are already removed by this time
because switch content is flushed in case of the reset.
This means that rules were deleted from HW but SW
still thinks they exist so when we get
SWITCHDEV_FDB_DEL_TO_DEVICE notification we try to
delete not existing rule.

We can avoid these errors by clearing the rules
early in the reset flow before they are removed from HW.
Switchdev API will get notified that the rule was removed
so we won't get SWITCHDEV_FDB_DEL_TO_DEVICE notification.
Remove unnecessary ice_clear_sw_switch_recipes.

ice 0000:01:00.0: Failed to delete FDB forward rule, err: -2
ice 0000:01:00.0: Failed to delete FDB guard rule, err: -2
