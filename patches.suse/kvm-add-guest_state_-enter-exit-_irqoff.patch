Subject: [PATCH] kvm: add guest_state_{enter,exit}_irqoff()

When transitioning to/from guest mode, it is necessary to inform
lockdep, tracing, and RCU in a specific order, similar to the
requirements for transitions to/from user mode. Additionally, it is
necessary to perform vtime accounting for a window around running the
guest, with RCU enabled, such that timer interrupts taken from the guest
can be accounted as guest time.

Most architectures don't handle all the necessary pieces, and a have a
number of common bugs, including unsafe usage of RCU during the window
between guest_enter() and guest_exit().

On x86, this was dealt with across commits:

  87fa7f3e98a1310e ("x86/kvm: Move context tracking where it belongs")
  0642391e2139a2c1 ("x86/kvm/vmx: Add hardirq tracing to guest enter/exit")
  9fc975e9efd03e57 ("x86/kvm/svm: Add hardirq tracing on guest enter/exit")
  3ebccdf373c21d86 ("x86/kvm/vmx: Move guest enter/exit into .noinstr.text")
  135961e0a7d555fc ("x86/kvm/svm: Move guest enter/exit into .noinstr.text")
  160457140187c5fb ("KVM: x86: Defer vtime accounting 'til after IRQ handling")
  bc908e091b326467 ("KVM: x86: Consolidate guest enter/exit logic to common helpers")

... but those fixes are specific to x86, and as the resulting logic
(while correct) is split across generic helper functions and
x86-specific helper functions, it is difficult to see that the
entry/exit accounting is balanced.

This patch adds generic helpers which architectures can use to handle
guest entry/exit consistently and correctly. The guest_{enter,exit}()
helpers are split into guest_timing_{enter,exit}() to perform vtime
accounting, and guest_context_{enter,exit}() to perform the necessary
context tracking and RCU management. The existing guest_{enter,exit}()
heleprs are left as wrappers of these.

Atop this, new guest_state_enter_irqoff() and guest_state_exit_irqoff()
helpers are added to handle the ordering of lockdep, tracing, and RCU
manageent. These are inteneded to mirror exit_to_user_mode() and
enter_from_user_mode().

Subsequent patches will migrate architectures over to the new helpers,
following a sequence:

	guest_timing_enter_irqoff();

	guest_state_enter_irqoff();
	< run the vcpu >
	guest_state_exit_irqoff();

	< take any pending IRQs >

	guest_timing_exit_irqoff();

This sequences handles all of the above correctly, and more clearly
balances the entry and exit portions, making it easier to understand.

The existing helpers are marked as deprecated, and will be removed once
all architectures have been converted.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
