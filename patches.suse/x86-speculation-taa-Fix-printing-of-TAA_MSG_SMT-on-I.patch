Subject: x86/speculation/taa: Fix printing of TAA_MSG_SMT on IBRS_ALL CPUs
Git-commit: 012206a822a8b6ac09125bfaa210a95b9eb8f1c1
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc8
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.11

For new IBRS_ALL CPUs, the Enhanced IBRS check at the beginning of
cpu_bugs_smt_update() causes the function to return early, unintentionally
skipping the MDS and TAA logic.

This is not a problem for MDS, because there appears to be no overlap
between IBRS_ALL and MDS-affected CPUs.  So the MDS mitigation would be
disabled and nothing would need to be done in this function anyway.

But for TAA, the TAA_MSG_SMT string will never get printed on Cascade
Lake and newer.

The check is superfluous anyway: when 'spectre_v2_enabled' is
SPECTRE_V2_IBRS_ENHANCED, 'spectre_v2_user' is always
SPECTRE_V2_USER_NONE, and so the 'spectre_v2_user' switch statement
handles it appropriately by doing nothing.  So just remove the check.
