Subject: drm/i915/pmu: Report frequency as zero while GPU is sleeping
Git-commit: b66ecd0438bf6079d08e8f2afea6114f468f56f4
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-12680, jsc#SLE-12880, jsc#SLE-12882, jsc#SLE-12883, jsc#SLE-13496, jsc#SLE-15322

We used to report the minimum possible frequency as both requested and
active while GPU was in sleep state. This was a consequence of sampling
the value from the "current frequency" field in our software tracking.

This was strictly speaking wrong, but given that until recently the
current frequency in sleeping state used to be equal to minimum, it did
not stand out sufficiently to be noticed as such.

After some recent changes have made the current frequency be reported
as last active before GPU went to sleep, meaning both requested and active
frequencies could end up being reported at their maximum values for the
duration of the GPU idle state, it became much more obvious that this does
not make sense.

To fix this we will now sample the frequency counters only when the GPU is
awake. As a consequence reported frequencies could be reported as below
the GPU reported minimum but that should be much less confusing that the
current situation.

v2:
 * Split out early exit conditions for readability. (Chris)
