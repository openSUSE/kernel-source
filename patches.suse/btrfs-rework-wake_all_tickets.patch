Subject: btrfs: rework wake_all_tickets
Git-commit: 2341ccd1bf05b3d844c10ad224cd38b06fd53219
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: bsc#1141456

Now that we no longer partially fill tickets we need to rework
wake_all_tickets to call btrfs_try_to_wakeup_tickets() in order to see
if any subsequent tickets are able to be satisfied.  If our tickets_id
changes we know something happened and we can keep flushing.

Also if we find a ticket that is smaller than the first ticket in our
queue then we want to retry the flushing loop again in case
may_commit_transaction() decides we could satisfy the ticket by
committing the transaction.

Rename this to maybe_fail_all_tickets() while we're at it, to better
reflect what the function is actually doing.
