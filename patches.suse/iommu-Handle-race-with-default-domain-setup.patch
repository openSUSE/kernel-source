Subject: [PATCH] iommu: Handle race with default domain setup
Git-commit: b46064a18810bad3aea089a79993ca5ea7a3d2b2
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc1
References: git-fixes

It turns out that deferred default domain creation leaves a subtle
race window during iommu_device_register() wherein a client driver may
asynchronously probe in parallel and get as far as performing DMA API
operations with dma-direct, only to be switched to iommu-dma underfoot
once the default domain attachment finally happens, with obviously
disastrous consequences. Even the wonky of_iommu_configure() path is at
risk, since iommu_fwspec_init() will no longer defer client probe as the
instance ops are (necessarily) already registered, and the "replay"
iommu_probe_device() call can see dev->iommu_group already set and so
think there's nothing to do either.

Fortunately we already have the right tool in the right place in the
form of iommu_device_use_default_domain(), which just needs to ensure
that said default domain is actually ready to *be* used. Deferring the
client probe shouldn't have too much impact, given that this only
happens while the IOMMU driver is probing, and thus due to kick the
deferred probe list again once it finishes.
