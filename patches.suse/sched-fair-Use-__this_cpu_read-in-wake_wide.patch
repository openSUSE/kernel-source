Subject: [PATCH] sched/fair: Use __this_cpu_read() in wake_wide()

References: bnc#1155798 (CPU scheduler functional and performance backports)
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
Git-commit: 17c891ab349138e8d8a59ca2700f42ce8af96f4e

The code is executed with preemption(and interrupts) disabled,
so it's safe to use __this_cpu_write().
