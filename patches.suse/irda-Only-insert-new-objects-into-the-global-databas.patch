Subject: irda: Only insert new objects into the global database via setsockopt
Patch-mainline: Never, driver dropped in mainline (4.17-rc1)
References: CVE-2018-6555 bsc#1106511

The irda_setsockopt() function conditionally allocates memory for a new
self->ias_object or, in some cases, reuses the existing
self->ias_object. Existing objects were incorrectly reinserted into the
LM_IAS database which corrupted the doubly linked list used for the
hashbin implementation of the LM_IAS database. When combined with a
memory leak in irda_bind(), this issue could be leveraged to create a
use-after-free vulnerability in the hashbin list. This patch fixes the
issue by only inserting newly allocated objects into the database.
