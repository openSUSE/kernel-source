Subject: VFS: use synchronize_rcu_expedited() in namespace_unlock()
References: bsc#1024412
Patch-mainline: submitted, https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10027405/

The synchronize_rcu() in namespace_unlock() is called every time
a filesystem is unmounted.  If a great many filesystems are mounted,
this can cause a noticable slow-down in, for example, system shutdown.

The sequence:
  mkdir -p /tmp/Mtest/{0..5000}
  time for i in /tmp/Mtest/*; do mount -t tmpfs tmpfs $i ; done
  time umount /tmp/Mtest/*

on a 4-cpu VM can report 8 seconds to mount the tmpfs filesystems, and
100 seconds to unmount them.

Boot the same VM with 1 CPU and it takes 18 seconds to mount the
tmpfs filesystems, but only 36 to unmount.

If we change the synchronize_rcu() to synchronize_rcu_expedited()
the umount time on a 4-cpu VM is 8 seconds to mount and 0.6 to
unmount.

I think this 200-fold speed up is worth the slightly higher system
impact of use synchronize_rcu_expedited().
