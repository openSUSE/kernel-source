Subject: ext4: fix a bug in ext4_wait_for_tail_page_commit
Git-commit: 565333a1554d704789e74205989305c811fd9c7a
Patch-mainline: 5.5-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.17

No need to wait for any commit once the page is fully truncated.
Besides, it may confuse e.g. concurrent ext4_writepage() with the page
still be dirty (will be cleared by truncate_pagecache() in
ext4_setattr()) but buffers has been freed; and then trigger a bug
show as below:

Run the procedure (generate by syzkaller) parallel with ext3.

void main()
{
	int fd, fd1, ret;
	void *addr;
	size_t length = 4096;
	int flags;
	off_t offset = 0;
	char *str = "12345";

	fd = open("a", O_RDWR | O_CREAT);
	assert(fd >= 0);

	/* Truncate to 4k */
	ret = ftruncate(fd, length);
	assert(ret == 0);

	/* Journal data mode */
	flags = 0xc00f;
	ret = ioctl(fd, _IOW('f', 2, long), &flags);
	assert(ret == 0);

	/* Truncate to 0 */
	fd1 = open("a", O_TRUNC | O_NOATIME);
	assert(fd1 >= 0);

	addr = mmap(NULL, length, PROT_WRITE | PROT_READ,
					MAP_SHARED, fd, offset);
	assert(addr != (void *)-1);

	memcpy(addr, str, 5);
	mbind(addr, length, 0, 0, 0, MPOL_MF_MOVE);
}

And the bug will be triggered once we seen the below order.

reproduce1                         reproduce2

...                            |   ...
truncate to 4k                 |
change to journal data mode    |
                               |   memcpy(set page dirty)
truncate to 0:                 |
ext4_setattr:                  |
...                            |
ext4_wait_for_tail_page_commit |
                               |   mbind(trigger bug)
truncate_pagecache(clean dirty)|   ...
...                            |

mbind will call ext4_writepage() since the page still be dirty, and then
report the bug since the buffers has been free. Fix it by return
directly once offset equals to 0 which means the page has been fully
truncated.
