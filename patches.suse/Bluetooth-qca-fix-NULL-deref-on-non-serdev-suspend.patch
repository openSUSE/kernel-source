Subject: [PATCH] Bluetooth: qca: fix NULL-deref on non-serdev suspend
Git-commit: 73e87c0a49fda31d7b589edccf4c72e924411371
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc6
References: git-fixes bsc#1224509 CVE-2024-35851

Qualcomm ROME controllers can be registered from the Bluetooth line
discipline and in this case the HCI UART serdev pointer is NULL.

Add the missing sanity check to prevent a NULL-pointer dereference when
wakeup() is called for a non-serdev controller during suspend.

Just return true for now to restore the original behaviour and address
the crash with pre-6.2 kernels, which do not have commit e9b3e5b8c657
("bluetooth: hci_qca: only assign wakeup with serial port support") that
causes the crash to happen already at setup() time.

Fixes: c1a74160eaf1 ("Bluetooth: hci_qca: Add device_may_wakeup support")
