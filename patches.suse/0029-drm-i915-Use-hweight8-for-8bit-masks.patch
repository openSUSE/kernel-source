Subject: drm/i915: Use hweight8() for 8bit masks
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: 0b14d96820d1fd05ea610a0f5f952b34e5a24f2c
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: bsc#1152489

Use hweight8() instead of hweight32() for 8bit masks. Doesn't actually
matter for us since the arch code will go for hweight32() anyway, but
maybe we stil want to do this for documentation purposes?
