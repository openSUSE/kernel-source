Subject: net: ena: Change license into format to SPDX in all files
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc1
Git-commit: 2246cbc2c298ff923896284f301ecc3b6566df8a
References: bsc#1177397

All ena files should now use SPDX format in their license string. This
doesn't change the license of the files, but rather states the same
license in fewer words.

Also update the license years in some of the files.
