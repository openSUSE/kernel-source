Subject: [PATCH] USB: usblp: fix a hang in poll() if disconnected
Git-commit: 9de2c43acf37a17dc4c69ff78bb099b80fb74325
Patch-mainline: v5.12-rc3
References: git-fixes

Apparently an application that opens a device and calls select()
on it, will hang if the decice is disconnected. It's a little
surprising that we had this bug for 15 years, but apparently
nobody ever uses select() with a printer: only write() and read(),
and those work fine. Well, you can also select() with a timeout.

The fix is modeled after devio.c. A few other drivers check the
condition first, then do not add the wait queue in case the
device is disconnected. We doubt that's completely race-free.
So, this patch adds the process first, then locks properly
and checks for the disconnect.
