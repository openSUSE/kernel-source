Subject: drm/nouveau/kms/nv50-: Don't allow inheritance of headless iors
Git-commit: 7ba84cbf18c7a53107c64880d9c90f18fa68b481
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc6
References: jsc#PED-3527 jsc#PED-5475 jsc#PED-6068 jsc#PED-6070 jsc#PED-6116 jsc#PED-6120 jsc#PED-5065 jsc#PED-5477 jsc#PED-5511 jsc#PED-6041 jsc#PED-6069 jsc#PED-6071

Turns out we made a silly mistake when coming up with OR inheritance on
nouveau. On pre-DCB 4.1, iors are statically routed to output paths via the
DCB. On later generations iors are only routed to an output path if they're
actually being used. Unfortunately, it appears with NVIF_OUTP_INHERIT_V0 we
make the mistake of assuming the later is true on all generations, which is
currently leading us to return bogus ior -> head assignments through nvif,
which causes WARN_ON().

So - fix this by verifying that we actually know that there's a head
assigned to an ior before allowing it to be inherited through nvif. This
-should- hopefully fix the WARN_ON on GT218 reported by Borislav.
