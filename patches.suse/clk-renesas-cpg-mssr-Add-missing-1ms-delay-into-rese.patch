Subject: [PATCH] clk: renesas: cpg-mssr: Add missing 1ms delay into reset toggle callback
Git-commit: 62abfd7bedc2b3d86d4209a4146f9d2b5ae21fab
Patch-mainline: v6.19-rc1
References: git-fixes

R-Car V4H Reference Manual R19UH0186EJ0130 Rev.1.30 Apr. 21, 2025 page
583 Figure 9.3.1(a) Software Reset flow (A) as well as flow (B) / (C)
indicate after reset has been asserted by writing a matching reset bit
into register SRCR, it is mandatory to wait 1ms.

This 1ms delay is documented on R-Car V4H and V4M, it is currently
unclear whether S4 is affected as well.  This patch does apply the extra
delay on R-Car S4 as well.

Fix the reset driver to respect the additional delay when toggling
resets.  Drivers which use separate reset_control_(de)assert() must
assure matching delay in their driver code.
