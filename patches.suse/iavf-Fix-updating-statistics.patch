Subject: iavf: Fix updating statistics
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc1
Git-commit: 9358076642f14cec8c414850d5a909cafca3a9d6
References: git-fixes

Commit bac8486116b0 ("iavf: Refactor the watchdog state machine") inverted
the logic for when to update statistics. Statistics should be updated when
no other commands are pending, instead they were only requested when a
command was processed. iavf_request_stats() would see a pending request
and not request statistics to be updated. This caused statistics to never
be updated; fix the logic.
