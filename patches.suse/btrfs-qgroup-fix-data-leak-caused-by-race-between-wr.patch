Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: qgroup: fix data leak caused by race between writeback
 and truncate

[BUG]
When running tests like generic/013 on test device with btrfs quota
enabled, it can normally lead to data leak, detected at unmount time:

  BTRFS warning (device dm-3): qgroup 0/5 has unreleased space, type 0 rsv 4096
  ------------[ cut here ]------------
  WARNING: CPU: 11 PID: 16386 at fs/btrfs/disk-io.c:4142 close_ctree+0x1dc/0x323 [btrfs]

  BTRFS error (device dm-3): qgroup reserved space leaked

[CAUSE]
In the offending case, the offending operations are:
2/6: writev f2X[269 1 0 0 0 0] [1006997,67,288] 0
2/7: truncate f2X[269 1 0 0 48 1026293] 18388 0

The following sequence of events could happen after the writev():
	CPU1 (writeback)		|		CPU2 (truncate)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
btrfs_writepages()			|
|- extent_write_cache_pages()		|
   |- Got page for 1003520		|
   |  1003520 is Dirty, no writeback	|
   |  So (!clear_page_dirty_for_io())   |
   |  gets called for it		|
   |- Now page 1003520 is Clean.	|
   |					| btrfs_setattr()
   |					| |- btrfs_setsize()
   |					|    |- truncate_setsize()
   |					|       New i_size is 18388
   |- __extent_writepage()		|
   |  |- page_offset() > i_size		|
      |- btrfs_invalidatepage()		|
	 |- Page is clean, so no qgroup |
	    callback executed

This means, the qgroup reserved data space is not properly released in
btrfs_invalidatepage() as the page is Clean.

[FIX]
Instead of checking the dirty bit of a page, call
btrfs_qgroup_free_data() unconditionally in btrfs_invalidatepage().

As qgroup rsv are completely bound to the QGROUP_RESERVED bit of
io_tree, not bound to page status, thus we won't cause double freeing
anyway.
