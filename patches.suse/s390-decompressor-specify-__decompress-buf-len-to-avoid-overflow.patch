Subject: s390/decompressor: specify __decompress() buf len to avoid overflow
Git-commit: 7ab41c2c08a32132ba8c14624910e2fe8ce4ba4b
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc7
References: git-fixes bsc#1213863

Historically calls to __decompress() didn't specify "out_len" parameter
on many architectures including s390, expecting that no writes beyond
uncompressed kernel image are performed. This has changed since commit
2aa14b1ab2c4 ("zstd: import usptream v1.5.2") which includes zstd library
commit 6a7ede3dfccb ("Reduce size of dctx by reutilizing dst buffer
(#2751)"). Now zstd decompression code might store literal buffer in
the unwritten portion of the destination buffer. Since "out_len" is
not set, it is considered to be unlimited and hence free to use for
optimization needs. On s390 this might corrupt initrd or ipl report
which are often placed right after the decompressor buffer. Luckily the
size of uncompressed kernel image is already known to the decompressor,
so to avoid the problem simply specify it in the "out_len" parameter.
