Subject: [PATCH] media: i2c: tda1997: Fix possible use-after-free in tda1997x_remove()
Git-commit: 7f820ab5d4eebfe2d970d32a76ae496a6c286f0f
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc1
References: git-fixes

This driver's remove path calls cancel_delayed_work(). However, that
function does not wait until the work function finishes. This means
that the callback function may still be running after the driver's
remove function has finished, which would result in a use-after-free.

Fix by calling cancel_delayed_work_sync(), which ensures that
the work is properly cancelled, no longer running, and unable
to re-schedule itself.
