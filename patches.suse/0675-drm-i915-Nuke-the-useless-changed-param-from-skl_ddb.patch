Subject: drm/i915: Nuke the useless changed param from
 skl_ddb_add_affected_pipes()

Git-commit: d7a145849b680075ce94d8b341905104e2ee58d0
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: bsc#1152489

changed==true just means we have some crtcs in the state. All the
stuff following this only operates on crtcs in the state anyway so
there is no point in having this bool.
