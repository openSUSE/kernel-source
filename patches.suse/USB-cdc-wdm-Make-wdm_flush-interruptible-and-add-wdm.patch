Subject: [PATCH] USB: cdc-wdm: Make wdm_flush() interruptible and add wdm_fsync().
Git-commit: 37d2a36394d954413a495da61da1b2a51ecd28ab
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc1
References: git-fixes

syzbot is reporting hung task at wdm_flush() [1], for there is a circular
dependency that wdm_flush() from flip_close() for /dev/cdc-wdm0 forever
waits for /dev/raw-gadget to be closed while close() for /dev/raw-gadget
cannot be called unless close() for /dev/cdc-wdm0 completes.

Tetsuo Handa considered that such circular dependency is an usage error [2]
which corresponds to an unresponding broken hardware [3]. But Alan Stern
responded that we should be prepared for such hardware [4]. Therefore,
this patch changes wdm_flush() to use wait_event_interruptible_timeout()
which gives up after 30 seconds, for hardware that remains silent must be
ignored. The 30 seconds are coming out of thin air.

Changing wait_event() to wait_event_interruptible_timeout() makes error
reporting from close() syscall less reliable. To compensate it, this patch
also implements wdm_fsync() which does not use timeout. Those who want to
be very sure that data has gone out to the device are now advised to call
fsync(), with a caveat that fsync() can return -EINVAL when running on
older kernels which do not implement wdm_fsync().

This patch also fixes three more problems (listed below) found during
exhaustive discussion and testing.

  Since multiple threads can concurrently call wdm_write()/wdm_flush(),
  we need to use wake_up_all() whenever clearing WDM_IN_USE in order to
  make sure that all waiters are woken up. Also, error reporting needs
  to use fetch-and-clear approach in order not to report same error for
  multiple times.

  Since wdm_flush() checks WDM_DISCONNECTING, wdm_write() should as well
  check WDM_DISCONNECTING.

  In wdm_flush(), since locks are not held, it is not safe to dereference
  desc->intf after checking that WDM_DISCONNECTING is not set [5]. Thus,
  remove dev_err() from wdm_flush().
