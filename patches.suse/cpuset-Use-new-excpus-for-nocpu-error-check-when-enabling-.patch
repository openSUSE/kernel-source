Subject: cpuset: Use new excpus for nocpu error check when enabling root
 partition
Git-commit: 59d5de3655698679ad8fd2cc82228de4679c4263
Patch-mainline: v6.18-rc1
References: bsc#1241166

A previous patch fixed a bug where new_prs should be assigned before
checking housekeeping conflicts. This patch addresses another potential
issue: the nocpu error check currently uses the xcpus which is not updated.
Although no issue has been observed so far, the check should be performed
using the new effective exclusive cpus.

The comment has been removed because the function returns an error if
nocpu checking fails, which is unrelated to the parent.
