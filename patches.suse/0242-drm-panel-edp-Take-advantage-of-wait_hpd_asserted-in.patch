Subject: drm/panel-edp: Take advantage of wait_hpd_asserted() in struct
 drm_dp_aux
Git-commit: 2327b13d6c4758926e57b5b6c3094302ae3b5e9b
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225 jsc#PED-2849

Let's add support for being able to read the HPD pin even if it's
hooked directly to the controller. This will allow us to get more
accurate delays also lets us take away the waiting in the AUX transfer
functions of the eDP controller drivers.
