Subject: btrfs: change the minimum global reserve size
Git-commit: 3593ce30b5b4a8fbe84dd1c275e9be01af28511a
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: bsc#1141456

It made sense to have the global reserve set at 16M in the past, but
since it is used less nowadays set the minimum size to the number of
items we'll need to update the main trees we update during a transaction
commit, plus some slop area so we can do unlinks if we need to.

In practice this doesn't affect normal file systems, but for xfstests
where we do things like fill up a fs and then rm * it can fall over in
weird ways.  This enables us for more sane behavior at extremely small
file system sizes.
