Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: fix abort logic in btrfs_replace_file_extents
Git-commit: 4afb912f439c4bc4e6a4f3e7547f2e69e354108f
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc6
References: stable-5.14.14

commit 4afb912f439c4bc4e6a4f3e7547f2e69e354108f upstream.

Error injection testing uncovered a case where we'd end up with a
corrupt file system with a missing extent in the middle of a file.  This
occurs because the if statement to decide if we should abort is wrong.

The only way we would abort in this case is if we got a ret !=
-EOPNOTSUPP and we called from the file clone code.  However the
prealloc code uses this path too.  Instead we need to abort if there is
an error, and the only error we _don't_ abort on is -EOPNOTSUPP and only
if we came from the clone file code.
