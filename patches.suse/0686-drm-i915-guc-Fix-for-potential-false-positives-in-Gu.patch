Subject: drm/i915/guc: Fix for potential false positives in GuC hang selftest
Git-commit: b7d2a4da38fb558832b70c6f45929649a9d114a3
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: drm-backport-placeholder

Noticed that the hangcheck selftest is submitting a non-preemptoble
spinner. That means that even if the GuC does not die, the heartbeat
will still kick in and trigger a reset. Which is rather defeating the
purpose of the test - to verify that the heartbeat will kick in if the
GuC itself has died. The test is deliberately killing the GuC, so it
should never hit the case of a non-dead GuC. But it is not impossible
that the kill might fail at some future point due to other driver
re-work.

So, make the spinner pre-emptible. That way the heartbeat can get
through if the GuC is alive and context switching. Thus a reset only
happens if the GuC dies. Thus, if the kill should stop working the
test will now fail rather than claim to pass.
