Subject: [PATCH] block: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in
 generic_make_request()
Patch-Mainline: Never, 4.19 stable kernel patch only
References: bsc#1139771

Commit 37f9579f4c31 ("blk-mq: Avoid that submitting a bio concurrently
with device removal triggers a crash") introduced a NULL pointer
dereference in generic_make_request(). The patch sets q to NULL and
enter_succeeded to false; right after, there's an 'if (enter_succeeded)'
which is not taken, and then the 'else' will dereference q in
blk_queue_dying(q).

This patch just moves the 'q = NULL' to a point in which it won't trigger
the oops, although the semantics of this NULLification remains untouched.

A simple test case/reproducer is as follows:
a) Build kernel v5.1-rc7 with CONFIG_BLK_CGROUP=n.

b) Create a raid0 md array with 2 NVMe devices as members, and mount it
with an ext4 filesystem.

c) Run the following oneliner (supposing the raid0 is mounted in /mnt):
(dd of=/mnt/tmp if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=999 &); sleep 0.3;
echo 1 > /sys/block/nvme0n1/device/device/remove
(whereas nvme0n1 is the 2nd array member)

This will trigger the following oops:

BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000078
PGD 0 P4D 0
Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI
RIP: 0010:generic_make_request+0x32b/0x400
Call Trace:
 submit_bio+0x73/0x140
 ext4_io_submit+0x4d/0x60
 ext4_writepages+0x626/0xe90

[...]

This patch has no functional changes and preserves the md/raid0 behavior
when a member is removed before kernel v4.17.
