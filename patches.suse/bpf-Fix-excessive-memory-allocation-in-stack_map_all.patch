Subject: bpf: Fix excessive memory allocation in stack_map_alloc()
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
Git-commit: b45043192b3e481304062938a6561da2ceea46a6
References: jsc#PED-1368

The 'n_buckets * (value_size + sizeof(struct stack_map_bucket))' part of the
allocated memory for 'smap' is never used after the memlock accounting was
removed, thus get rid of it.

[ Note, Daniel:

Commit b936ca643ade ("bpf: rework memlock-based memory accounting for maps")
moved `cost += n_buckets * (value_size + sizeof(struct stack_map_bucket))`
up and therefore before the bpf_map_area_alloc() allocation, sigh. In a later
step commit c85d69135a91 ("bpf: move memory size checks to bpf_map_charge_init()"),
and the overflow checks of `cost >= U32_MAX - PAGE_SIZE` moved into
bpf_map_charge_init(). And then 370868107bf6 ("bpf: Eliminate rlimit-based
memory accounting for stackmap maps") finally removed the bpf_map_charge_init().
Anyway, the original code did the allocation same way as /after/ this fix. ]
