Subject: [PATCH] xhci: Add a separate debug message for split transaction
 errors.
Git-commit: 76eac5d21a7164afb24bd5d823ee70ee2d60efc3
References: jsc#SLE-14911
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1

Don't show the same error message for transaction errors and split
transaction errors. It's very confusing while debugging.

Transaction errors are often due to electrical interference.
Split transaction errors are about xHC not being able to
schedule start and complete split transactions needed to address
low- and full-speed devices behind high-speed hubs.
