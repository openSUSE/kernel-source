        drm/i915: Allow userspace to clone contexts on creation

and moved in

        drm/i915/gem: Safely acquire the ctx->vm when copying

suggested that i915_address_space were at least intended to be managed
through SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU:

                * This ppgtt may have be reallocated between
                * the read and the kref, and reassigned to a third
                * context. In order to avoid inadvertent sharing
                * of this ppgtt with that third context (and not
                * src), we have to confirm that we have the same
                * ppgtt after passing through the strong memory
                * barrier implied by a successful
                * kref_get_unless_zero().

But extensive git history search has not brough any such reuse to
light.

What has come to light though is that ever since

    drm/i915: Pull i915_vma_pin under the vm->mutex

(yes this commit is earlier) the final i915_vma_put call has been
moved from i915_gem_context_free (now called _release) to
context_close, which means it's not actually safe anymore to access
the ctx->vm pointer without lock helds, because it might disappear at
any moment. Note that superficially things all still work, because the
i915_address_space is RCU protected since

        drm/i915/gtt: Defer address space cleanup to an RCU worker

except the very clever macro above (which is designed to protected
against object reuse due to SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU or similar tricks)
results in an endless loop if the refcount of the ctx->vm ever
permanently drops to 0. Which it totally now can.

Fix that by moving the final i915_vm_put to where it should be.

Note that i915_gem_context is rcu protected, but _only_ the final
kfree. This means anyone who chases a pointer to a gem ctx solely
under the protection can pretty only call kref_get_unless_zero(). This
seems to be pretty much the case, aside from a bunch of cases that
consult the scheduling information without any further protection.
