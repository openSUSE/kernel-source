Subject: cxgb4: fix Txq restart check during backpressure
Git-commit: f1f20a8666c55cb534b8f3fc1130eebf01a06155
Patch-mainline: 5.6
References: networking-stable-20_03_28

Driver reclaims descriptors in much smaller batches, even if hardware
indicates more to reclaim, during backpressure. So, fix the check to
restart the Txq during backpressure, by looking at how many
descriptors hardware had indicated to reclaim, and not on how many
descriptors that driver had actually reclaimed. Once the Txq is
restarted, driver will reclaim even more descriptors when Tx path
is entered again.
