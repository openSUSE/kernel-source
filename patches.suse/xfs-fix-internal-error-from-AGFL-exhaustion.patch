Subject: [PATCH] xfs: fix internal error from AGFL exhaustion
Git-commit: f63a5b3769ad7659da4c0420751d78958ab97675
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc2
References: bsc#1218830

We've been seeing XFS errors like the following:

Xfs: Internal error i != 1 at line 3526 of file fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_btree.c.  Caller xfs_btree_insert+0x1ec/0x280
...
Call Trace:
 xfs_corruption_error+0x94/0xa0
 xfs_btree_insert+0x221/0x280
 xfs_alloc_fixup_trees+0x104/0x3e0
 xfs_alloc_ag_vextent_size+0x667/0x820
 xfs_alloc_fix_freelist+0x5d9/0x750
 xfs_free_extent_fix_freelist+0x65/0xa0
 __xfs_free_extent+0x57/0x180
...

This is the XFS_IS_CORRUPT() check in xfs_btree_insert() when
xfs_btree_insrec() fails.

After converting this into a panic and dissecting the core dump, I found
that xfs_btree_insrec() is failing because it's trying to split a leaf
node in the cntbt when the AG free list is empty. In particular, it's
failing to get a block from the AGFL _while trying to refill the AGFL_.

If a single operation splits every level of the bnobt and the cntbt (and
the rmapbt if it is enabled) at once, the free list will be empty. Then,
when the next operation tries to refill the free list, it allocates
space. If the allocation does not use a full extent, it will need to
insert records for the remaining space in the bnobt and cntbt. And if
those new records go in full leaves, the leaves (and potentially more
nodes up to the old root) need to be split.

Fix it by accounting for the additional splits that may be required to
refill the free list in the calculation for the minimum free list size.

P.S. As far as I can tell, this bug has existed for a long time -- maybe
back to xfs-history commit afdf80ae7405 ("Add XFS_AG_MAXLEVELS macros
...") in April 1994! It requires a very unlucky sequence of events, and
in fact we didn't hit it until a particular sparse mmap workload updated
from 5.12 to 5.19. But this bug existed in 5.12, so it must've been
exposed by some other change in allocation or writeback patterns. It's
also much less likely to be hit with the rmapbt enabled, since that
increases the minimum free list size and is unlikely to split at the
same time as the bnobt and cntbt.
