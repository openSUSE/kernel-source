Subject: perf: Fix refcount warning on event->mmap_count increment
Git-commit: d06bf78e55d5159c1b00072e606ab924ffbbad35
Patch-mainline: v6.19-rc7
References: perf-events-v6.19-update

When calling refcount_inc(&event->mmap_count) inside perf_mmap_rb(), the
following warning is triggered:

        refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.
        WARNING: lib/refcount.c:25

PoC:

    struct perf_event_attr attr = {0};
    int fd = syscall(__NR_perf_event_open, &attr, 0, -1, -1, 0);
    mmap(NULL, 0x3000, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
    int victim = syscall(__NR_perf_event_open, &attr, 0, -1, fd,
                         PERF_FLAG_FD_OUTPUT);
    mmap(NULL, 0x3000, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, victim, 0);

This occurs when creating a group member event with the flag
PERF_FLAG_FD_OUTPUT. The group leader should be mmap-ed and then mmap-ing
the event triggers the warning.

Since the event has copied the output_event in perf_event_set_output(),
event->rb is set. As a result, perf_mmap_rb() calls
refcount_inc(&event->mmap_count) when event->mmap_count = 0.

Disallow the case when event->mmap_count = 0. This also prevents two
events from updating the same user_page.
