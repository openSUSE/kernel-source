Subject: [PATCH] block, bfq: update inject limit only after injection occurred
Git-commit: 23ed570accc94cf9de9036b71102aa7c0e0e8dc6
Patch-Mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: bsc#1156419,jsc#SLE-8281

BFQ updates the injection limit of each bfq_queue as a function of how
much the limit inflates the service times experienced by the I/O
requests of the queue. So only service times affected by injection
must be taken into account. Unfortunately, in the current
implementation of this update scheme, the service time of an I/O
request rq not affected by injection may happen to be considered in
the following case: there is no I/O request in service when rq
arrives.

This commit fixes this issue by making sure that only service times
affected by injection are considered for updating the injection
limit. In particular, the service time of an I/O request rq is now
considered only if at least one of the following two conditions holds:
- the destination bfq_queue for rq underwent injection before rq
arrival, and there is still I/O in service in the drive on rq arrival
(the service of such unfinished I/O may delay the service of rq);
- injection occurs between the arrival and the completion time of rq.
