Subject: [PATCH] regulator: core: avoid regulator_resolve_supply() race condition
Git-commit: eaa7995c529b54d68d97a30f6344cc6ca2f214a7
Patch-mainline: v5.11-rc6
References: git-fixes

The final step in regulator_register() is to call
regulator_resolve_supply() for each registered regulator
(including the one in the process of being registered).  The
regulator_resolve_supply() function first checks if rdev->supply
is NULL, then it performs various steps to try to find the supply.
If successful, rdev->supply is set inside of set_supply().

This procedure can encounter a race condition if two concurrent
tasks call regulator_register() near to each other on separate CPUs
and one of the regulators has rdev->supply_name specified.  There
is currently nothing guaranteeing atomicity between the rdev->supply
check and set steps.  Thus, both tasks can observe rdev->supply==NULL
in their regulator_resolve_supply() calls.  This then results in
both creating a struct regulator for the supply.  One ends up
actually stored in rdev->supply and the other is lost (though still
present in the supply's consumer_list).

Here is a kernel log snippet showing the issue:

[   12.421768] gpu_cc_gx_gdsc: supplied by pm8350_s5_level
[   12.425854] gpu_cc_gx_gdsc: supplied by pm8350_s5_level
[   12.429064] debugfs: Directory 'regulator.4-SUPPLY' with parent
               '17a00000.rsc:rpmh-regulator-gfxlvl-pm8350_s5_level'
               already present!

Avoid this race condition by holding the rdev->mutex lock inside
of regulator_resolve_supply() while checking and setting
rdev->supply.
