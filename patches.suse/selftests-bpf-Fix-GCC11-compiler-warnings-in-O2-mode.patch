Subject: selftests/bpf: Fix GCC11 compiler warnings in -O2 mode
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
Git-commit: d3b0b80064e0416850f818184b8f7bba9fdf8c40
References: jsc#PED-1368

When compiling selftests in -O2 mode with GCC1, we get three new
compilations warnings about potentially uninitialized variables.

Compiler is wrong 2 out of 3 times, but this patch makes GCC11 happy
anyways, as it doesn't cost us anything and makes optimized selftests
build less annoying.

The amazing one is tc_redirect case of token that is malloc()'ed before
ASSERT_OK_PTR() check is done on it. Seems like GCC pessimistically
assumes that libbpf_get_error() will dereference the contents of the
pointer (no it won't), so the only way I found to shut GCC up was to do
zero-initializaing calloc(). This one was new to me.

For linfo case, GCC didn't realize that linfo_size will be initialized
by the function that is returning linfo_size as out parameter.

core_reloc.c case was a real bug, we can goto cleanup before initializing
obj. But we don't need to do any clean up, so just continue iteration
intstead.
