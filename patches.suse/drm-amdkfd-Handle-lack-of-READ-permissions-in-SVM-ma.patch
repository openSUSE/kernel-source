Subject: [PATCH] drm/amdkfd: Handle lack of READ permissions in SVM mapping
Git-commit: 0ed704d058cec7643a716a21888d58c7d03f2c3e
Patch-mainline: v6.18-rc1
References: stable-fixes

HMM assumes that pages have READ permissions by default. Inside
svm_range_validate_and_map, we add READ permissions then add WRITE
permissions if the VMA isn't read-only. This will conflict with regions
that only have PROT_WRITE or have PROT_NONE. When that happens,
svm_range_restore_work will continue to retry, silently, giving the
impression of a hang if pr_debug isn't enabled to show the retries..

If pages don't have READ permissions, simply unmap them and continue. If
they weren't mapped in the first place, this would be a no-op. Since x86
doesn't support write-only, and PROT_NONE doesn't allow reads or writes
anyways, this will allow the svm range validation to continue without
getting stuck in a loop forever on mappings we can't use with HMM.
