Subject: [PATCH] dmaengine: idxd: Avoid unnecessary destruction of file_ida
Git-commit: 76e43fa6a456787bad31b8d0daeabda27351a480
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc1
References: git-fixes CVE-2024-38629 bsc#1226905

file_ida is allocated during cdev open and is freed accordingly
during cdev release. This sequence is guaranteed by driver file
operations. Therefore, there is no need to destroy an already empty
file_ida when the WQ cdev is removed.

Worse, ida_free() in cdev release may happen after destruction of
file_ida per WQ cdev. This can lead to accessing an id in file_ida
after it has been destroyed, resulting in a kernel panic.

Remove ida_destroy(&file_ida) to address these issues.
