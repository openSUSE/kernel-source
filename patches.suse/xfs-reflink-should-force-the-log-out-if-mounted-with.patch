Subject: [PATCH] xfs: reflink should force the log out if mounted with wsync
Git-commit: 5833112df7e9a306af9af09c60127b92ed723962
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: git-fixes

Reflink should force the log out to disk if the filesystem was mounted
with wsync, the same as most other operations in xfs.

[note: XFS_MOUNT_WSYNC is set when the admin mounts the filesystem
with either the 'wsync' or 'sync' mount options, which effectively means
that we're classifying reflink/dedupe as IO operations and making them
synchronous when required.]
