Subject: [PATCH] mm/memory-failure: fix hardware poison check in
 unpoison_memory()
References: bsc#1012628 jsc#PED-5859
Patch-mainline: 6.4.8
Git-commit: 6c54312f9689fbe27c70db5d42eebd29d04b672e

commit 6c54312f9689fbe27c70db5d42eebd29d04b672e upstream.

It was pointed out[1] that using folio_test_hwpoison() is wrong as we need
to check the indiviual page that has poison.  folio_test_hwpoison() only
checks the head page so go back to using PageHWPoison().

User-visible effects include existing hwpoison-inject tests possibly
failing as unpoisoning a single subpage could lead to unpoisoning an
entire folio.  Memory unpoisoning could also not work as expected as
the function will break early due to only checking the head page and
not the actually poisoned subpage.
