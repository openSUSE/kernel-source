Subject: [PATCH] exec: Force single empty string when argv is empty
Git-commit: dcd46d897adb70d63e025f175a00a89797d31a43
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: bsc#1200571 CVE-2022-49264 bsc#1237815

[ backport note: quite lots of rewrites from the original patch;
  pr_warn_once() is moved to prepare_arg_pages(), the empty string
  filling is done via copy_strings_kernel() instead of
  copy_string_kernel() (that doesn't exist yet in this kernel),
  and the hunk for kernel_execve() is dropped, too -- tiwai ]

Quoting[1] Ariadne Conill:

"In several other operating systems, it is a hard requirement that the
second argument to execve(2) be the name of a program, thus prohibiting
a scenario where argc < 1. POSIX 2017 also recommends this behaviour,
but it is not an explicit requirement[2]:

    The argument arg0 should point to a filename string that is
    associated with the process being started by one of the exec
    functions.
...
Interestingly, Michael Kerrisk opened an issue about this in 2008[3],
but there was no consensus to support fixing this issue then.
Hopefully now that CVE-2021-4034 shows practical exploitative use[4]
of this bug in a shellcode, we can reconsider.

This issue is being tracked in the KSPP issue tracker[5]."

While the initial code searches[6][7] turned up what appeared to be
mostly corner case tests, trying to that just reject argv == NULL
(or an immediately terminated pointer list) quickly started tripping[8]
existing userspace programs.

The next best approach is forcing a single empty string into argv and
adjusting argc to match. The number of programs depending on argc == 0
seems a smaller set than those calling execve with a NULL argv.

Account for the additional stack space in bprm_stack_limits(). Inject an
empty string when argc == 0 (and set argc = 1). Warn about the case so
userspace has some notice about the change:

    process './argc0' launched './argc0' with NULL argv: empty string added

Additionally WARN() and reject NULL argv usage for kernel threads.
