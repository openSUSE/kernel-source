Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: sdw_utils: cs42l43: Enable Headphone pin for LINEOUT jack type
Git-commit: 390caeed0897fcac75f3c414dbdd85d593183d9c
Patch-mainline: v6.19-rc6
References: git-fixes

The CS42L43 codec's load detection can return different impedance values
that map to either HEADPHONE or LINEOUT jack types. However, the
soc_jack_pins array only maps SND_JACK_HEADPHONE to the "Headphone" DAPM
pin, not SND_JACK_LINEOUT.

When headphones are detected with an impedance that maps to LINEOUT
(such as impedance value 0x2), the driver reports SND_JACK_LINEOUT.
Since this doesn't match the jack pin mask, the "Headphone" DAPM pin
is not activated, and no audio is routed to the headphone outputs.

Fix by adding SND_JACK_LINEOUT to the Headphone pin mask, so that both
headphone and line-out detection properly enable the headphone output
path.

This fixes no audio output on devices like the Lenovo ThinkPad P16 Gen 3
where headphones are detected with LINEOUT impedance.
