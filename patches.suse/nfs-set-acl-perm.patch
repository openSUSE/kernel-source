Subject: VFS: don't test owner for NFS in set_posix_acl()
References: bsc#1103405
Patch-mainline: Never, this is a hack

The owner seen in inode->i_uid should not be used for permission
checking in NFS.  The server should always be asked, either with the
ACCESS request, or by trying the operation.

posix_set_acl() does test inode->i_uid, so can deny permission
when it should be granted.  So disable this for NFS.

Upstream fix will probably add a new flag to inode_permission(), and
use that.
