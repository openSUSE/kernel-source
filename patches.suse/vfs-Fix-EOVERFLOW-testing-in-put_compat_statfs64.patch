Subject: vfs: Fix EOVERFLOW testing in put_compat_statfs64
Git-commit: cc3a7bfe62b947b423fcb2cfe89fcba92bf48fa3
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc2
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.6

Today, put_compat_statfs64() disallows nearly any field value over
2^32 if f_bsize is only 32 bits, but that makes no sense.
compat_statfs64 is there for the explicit purpose of providing 64-bit
fields for f_files, f_ffree, etc.  And f_bsize is always only 32 bits.

As a result, 32-bit userspace gets -EOVERFLOW for i.e.  large file
counts even with -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 set.

In reality, only f_bsize and f_frsize can legitimately overflow
(fields like f_type and f_namelen should never be large), so test
only those fields.

This bug was discussed at length some time ago, and this is the proposal
Al suggested at https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/8/6/640.  It seemed to get
dropped amid the discussion of other related changes, but this
part seems obviously correct on its own, so I've picked it up and
sent it, for expediency.
