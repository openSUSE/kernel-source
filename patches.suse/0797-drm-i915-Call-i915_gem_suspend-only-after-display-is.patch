Subject: drm/i915: Call i915_gem_suspend() only after display is turned off

Git-commit: 421f5410965dbc65b7bf7d2b2323203920ad370c
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225 jsc#PED-2849

When the last reference of a gem object is removed it is added to the
mm.free_list list and mm.free_work is queued to actually free the
object.

So gem objects that had their last reference removed by display during
drm_atomic_helper_shutdown() are added to mm.free_list what could
cause that mm.free_work is executed at the same time as
intel_runtime_pm_driver_release() causing raw-wakerefs warning.

So here only calling i915_gem_suspend() and by consequence
i915_gem_drain_freed_objects() only after display is down making
sure all display gem objecs are freed when
intel_runtime_pm_driver_release() is executed.
