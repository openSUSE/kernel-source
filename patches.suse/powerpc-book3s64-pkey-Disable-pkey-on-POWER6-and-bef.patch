Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/book3s64/pkey: Disable pkey on POWER6 and before

References: jsc#SLE-16556 bsc#1078248 FATE#322447
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc1
Git-commit: 269e829f48a0d0d27667abe25ca5c9e5b6ab08e2

POWER6 only supports AMR update via privileged mode (MSR[PR] = 0,
SPRN_AMR=29) The PR=1 (userspace) alias for that SPR (SPRN_AMR=13) was
only supported from POWER7. Since we don't allow userspace modifying
of AMR value we should disable pkey support on P6 and before.

The hypervisor will still report pkey support via
"ibm,processor-storage-keys". Hence also check for P7 CPU_FTR bit to
decide on pkey support.
