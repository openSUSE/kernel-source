Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda: ALC287: Add Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 9i 14ITL5 speaker quirk
Git-commit: b81e9e5c723de936652653241d3dc4f33ae05e8c
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
References: git-fixes

The speaker fixup that is used for the Yoga 7 14ITL5 also applies to
the IdeaPad Slim 9i 14ITL5. The attached patch applies the quirk to
initialise the amplifier on the IdeaPad Slim 9i as well.

This is validated to work on my laptop.
