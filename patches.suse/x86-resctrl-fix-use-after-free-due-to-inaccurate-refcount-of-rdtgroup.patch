Subject: x86/resctrl: Fix use-after-free due to inaccurate refcount of rdtgroup
Git-commit: 074fadee59ee7a9d2b216e9854bd4efb5dad679f
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc1
References: bsc#1152489

There is a race condition in the following scenario which results in an
use-after-free issue when reading a monitoring file and deleting the
parent ctrl_mon group concurrently:

Thread 1 calls atomic_inc() to take refcount of rdtgrp and then calls
kernfs_break_active_protection() to drop the active reference of kernfs
node in rdtgroup_kn_lock_live().

In Thread 2, kernfs_remove() is a blocking routine. It waits on all sub
kernfs nodes to drop the active reference when removing all subtree
kernfs nodes recursively. Thread 2 could block on kernfs_remove() until
Thread 1 calls kernfs_break_active_protection(). Only after
kernfs_remove() completes the refcount of rdtgrp could be trusted.

Before Thread 1 calls atomic_inc() and kernfs_break_active_protection(),
Thread 2 could call kfree() when the refcount of rdtgrp (sentry) is 0
instead of 1 due to the race.

In Thread 1, in rdtgroup_kn_unlock(), referring to earlier rdtgrp memory
(rdtgrp->waitcount) which was already freed in Thread 2 results in
use-after-free issue.

  && (flags & RDT_DELETED)
    /* kn->active++ */
    kernfs_unbreak_active_protection(kn)
    kfree(rdtgrp)

Fix it by moving free_all_child_rdtgrp() to after kernfs_remove() in
rdtgroup_rmdir_ctrl() to ensure it has the accurate refcount of rdtgrp.
