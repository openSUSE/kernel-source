Subject: [PATCH] can: at91_can: Fix memory leak in at91_can_probe()
Git-commit: 0baa4d3170d72a2a8dc93bf729d6d04ad113dc72
Patch-mainline: v6.19-rc8
References: git-fixes

In at91_can_probe(), the dev structure is allocated via alloc_candev().
However, if the subsequent call to devm_phy_optional_get() fails, the
code jumps directly to exit_iounmap, missing the call to free_candev().
This results in a memory leak of the allocated net_device structure.

Fix this by jumping to the exit_free label instead, which ensures that
free_candev() is called to properly release the memory.

Compile tested only. Issue found using a prototype static analysis tool
and code review.
