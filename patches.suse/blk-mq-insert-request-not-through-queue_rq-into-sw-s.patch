Subject: [PATCH] blk-mq: insert request not through ->queue_rq into
 sw/scheduler queue
Git-commit: db03f88fae8a2c8007caafa70287798817df2875
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc3
References: bsc#1182443

c616cbee97ae ("blk-mq: punt failed direct issue to dispatch list") supposed
to add request which has been through ->queue_rq() to the hw queue dispatch
list, however it adds request running out of budget or driver tag to hw queue
too. This way basically bypasses request merge, and causes too many request
dispatched to LLD, and system% is unnecessary increased.

Fixes this issue by adding request not through ->queue_rq into sw/scheduler
queue, and this way is safe because no ->queue_rq is called on this request
yet.

High %system can be observed on Azure storvsc device, and even soft lock
is observed. This patch reduces %system during heavy sequential IO,
meantime decreases soft lockup risk.
