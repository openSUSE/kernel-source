Subject: printk/console: Correctly mark console that is used when opening /dev/console
Patch-mainline: Never, an extensive clean up is being prepared for upstream
References: bsc#1040020

showconsole tool shows the real name of tty device associated with
/dev/console. It expects that the related console driver has set
CON_CONSDEV flag.

On the other hand, kernel ignores CON_CONSDEV flag when it looks
for the right driver. Instead, it takes the first driver that
has the tty binding (console->device). See tty_lookup_driver()
and console_device().

All this works most of the time because kernel puts the driver
with CON_CONSDEV flag first into the list. There is almost always
registered a real (non-boot) console with this flag set. The real
consoles mostly (always?) have tty binding. Boot consoles that
might miss the tty binding are always removed unless keep_bootcon
command line parameter is used.

The problem is when some consoles are defined on the command line
and the preferred one (last one) is not registered from some reason.
Note that the consoles might be added to the command line also
using ACPI SPCR or device tree. It might happen that, for example,
SPCR code and user add the same console using two aliases.
Then the first alias matches and we might miss that it matched
also with the preferred console.

There was one attempt to fix this by searching the command line
from the end and match the preferred alias first. But it caused
regressions. For example, ttyS* are taken as aliases as well
and kernel messages can appear only on one serial port.
The reversed matching caused that the logs suddenly appeared
on another serial port.

The right solution is to set CON_CONSDEV flag for the driver
used by tty_lookup_driver() even when the preferred console
is not registered.

It is a bit complicated because register_console() code is tricky.
It expects that only the preferred driver will have CON_CONSDEV
flag set. Also it expects that a boot console will stay first
in the list until the preferred console is registered. These
information are used to make various decisions:

    + Use a fallback code when none console is configured on
      the command line. This code tries to enable any console
      until a real one is enabled.

    + Unregister all boot consoles when the real preferred one
      is registered. And do not reply the log on the real console
      to avoid duplicates.

A rather invasive clean up is being prepared for upstream. This
patch tries to be as minimalist and do not change the order
of consoles as possible.

It keeps the logic about having a boot console first until
the real preferred console is registered. But it makes sure
that the first console with tty binding (console->device) will
have CON_CONSDEV flag set. Let's look at this in more details.

The fallback code in console_register() already works as
expected. It sets CON_CONSDEV flag for any console with
tty binding.

The code matching all consoles from the command line newly sets
CON_CONSDEV flag also for the fist console with the tty binding.
But it sets "consdev_fallback" to avoid putting this console
first into the list. Remember that we want to keep the boot
console first until the preferred is registered. The information
about the fallback is used also to avoid doing other actions
that need to wait for the preferred console.

The code adding the console into the list of drivers must
put non-preferred drivers with tty binding next to the
console with CON_CONSDEV set. This is the only change that
might change the order of console drivers in the list
and eventually cause regressions. But it has an effect only
when there are at least three drivers mentioned on the command
line, a boot console is registered and the preferred driver
is not registered. This should be a corner case.

Finally, unregister_console() sets CON_CONSDEV to first console
with tty binding instead of the first one in the list.
