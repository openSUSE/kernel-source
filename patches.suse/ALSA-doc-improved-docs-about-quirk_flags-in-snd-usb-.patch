 quirk_flags
-    Contains the bit flags for various device specific workarounds.
-    Applied to the corresponding card index.
+    The option provides a refined and flexible control for applying quirk
+    flags.  It allows to specify the quirk flags for each device, and can
+    be modified dynamically via sysfs.
+    The old usage accepts an array of integers, each of which applies quirk
+    flags on the device in the order of probing.
+    E.g., ``quirk_flags=0x01,0x02`` applies get_sample_rate to the first
+    device, and share_media_device to the second device.
+    The new usage accepts a string in the format of
+    ``VID1:PID1:FLAGS1;VID2:PID2:FLAGS2;...``, where ``VIDx`` and ``PIDx``
+    specify the device, and ``FLAGSx`` specify the flags to be applied.
+    ``VIDx`` and ``PIDx`` are 4-digit hexadecimal numbers, and can be
+    specified as ``*`` to match any value.  ``FLAGSx`` can be a set of
+    flags given by name, separated by ``|``, or a hexadecimal number
+    representing the bit flags.  The available flag names are listed below.
+    An exclamation mark can be prefixed to a flag name to negate the flag.
+    For example, ``1234:abcd:mixer_playback_min_mute|!ignore_ctl_error;*:*:0x01;``
+    applies the ``mixer_playback_min_mute`` flag and clears the
+    ``ignore_ctl_error`` flag for the device 1234:abcd, and applies the
+    ``skip_sample_rate`` flag for all devices.
