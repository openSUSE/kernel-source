Subject: drm/fb-helper: Remove drm_fb_helper_defio_init() and update docs
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: 8e86dee02253306c72752d4cbd588e90672bc50a
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: bsc#1152472

There are no users of drm_fb_helper_defio_init(), so we can remove
it. The documentation around defio support is a bit misleading and
should mention compatibility issues with SHMEM helpers. Clarify this.
