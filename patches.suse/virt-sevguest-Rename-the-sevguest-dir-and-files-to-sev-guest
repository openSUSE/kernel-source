+===================================================================
+The Definitive SEV Guest API Documentation
+===================================================================
+
+1. General description
+======================
+
+The SEV API is a set of ioctls that are used by the guest or hypervisor
+to get or set a certain aspect of the SEV virtual machine. The ioctls belong
+to the following classes:
+
+ - Hypervisor ioctls: These query and set global attributes which affect the
+   whole SEV firmware.  These ioctl are used by platform provisioning tools.
+
+ - Guest ioctls: These query and set attributes of the SEV virtual machine.
+
+2. API description
+==================
+
+This section describes ioctls that is used for querying the SEV guest report
+from the SEV firmware. For each ioctl, the following information is provided
+along with a description:
+
+  Technology:
+      which SEV technology provides this ioctl. SEV, SEV-ES, SEV-SNP or all.
+
+  Type:
+      hypervisor or guest. The ioctl can be used inside the guest or the
+      hypervisor.
+
+  Parameters:
+      what parameters are accepted by the ioctl.
+
+  Returns:
+      the return value.  General error numbers (-ENOMEM, -EINVAL)
+      are not detailed, but errors with specific meanings are.
+
+The guest ioctl should be issued on a file descriptor of the /dev/sev-guest device.
+The ioctl accepts struct snp_user_guest_request. The input and output structure is
+specified through the req_data and resp_data field respectively. If the ioctl fails
+to execute due to a firmware error, then fw_err code will be set otherwise the
+fw_err will be set to 0x00000000000000ff.
+
+The firmware checks that the message sequence counter is one greater than
+the guests message sequence counter. If guest driver fails to increment message
+counter (e.g. counter overflow), then -EIO will be returned.
+
+::
+
+        struct snp_guest_request_ioctl {
+                /* Message version number */
+                __u32 msg_version;
+
+                /* Request and response structure address */
+                __u64 req_data;
+                __u64 resp_data;
+
+                /* firmware error code on failure (see psp-sev.h) */
+                __u64 fw_err;
+        };
+
+2.1 SNP_GET_REPORT
+------------------
+
+:Technology: sev-snp
+:Type: guest ioctl
+:Parameters (in): struct snp_report_req
+:Returns (out): struct snp_report_resp on success, -negative on error
+
+The SNP_GET_REPORT ioctl can be used to query the attestation report from the
+SEV-SNP firmware. The ioctl uses the SNP_GUEST_REQUEST (MSG_REPORT_REQ) command
+provided by the SEV-SNP firmware to query the attestation report.
+
+On success, the snp_report_resp.data will contains the report. The report
+contain the format described in the SEV-SNP specification. See the SEV-SNP
+specification for further details.
+
+2.2 SNP_GET_DERIVED_KEY
+-----------------------
+:Technology: sev-snp
+:Type: guest ioctl
+:Parameters (in): struct snp_derived_key_req
+:Returns (out): struct snp_derived_key_resp on success, -negative on error
+
+The SNP_GET_DERIVED_KEY ioctl can be used to get a key derive from a root key.
+The derived key can be used by the guest for any purpose, such as sealing keys
+or communicating with external entities.
+
+The ioctl uses the SNP_GUEST_REQUEST (MSG_KEY_REQ) command provided by the
+SEV-SNP firmware to derive the key. See SEV-SNP specification for further details
+on the various fields passed in the key derivation request.
+
+On success, the snp_derived_key_resp.data contains the derived key value. See
+the SEV-SNP specification for further details.
+
+
+2.3 SNP_GET_EXT_REPORT
+----------------------
+:Technology: sev-snp
+:Type: guest ioctl
+:Parameters (in/out): struct snp_ext_report_req
+:Returns (out): struct snp_report_resp on success, -negative on error
+
+The SNP_GET_EXT_REPORT ioctl is similar to the SNP_GET_REPORT. The difference is
+related to the additional certificate data that is returned with the report.
+The certificate data returned is being provided by the hypervisor through the
+SNP_SET_EXT_CONFIG.
+
+The ioctl uses the SNP_GUEST_REQUEST (MSG_REPORT_REQ) command provided by the SEV-SNP
+firmware to get the attestation report.
+
+On success, the snp_ext_report_resp.data will contain the attestation report
+and snp_ext_report_req.certs_address will contain the certificate blob. If the
+length of the blob is smaller than expected then snp_ext_report_req.certs_len will
+be updated with the expected value.
+
+See GHCB specification for further detail on how to parse the certificate blob.
+
+3. SEV-SNP CPUID Enforcement
+============================
+
+SEV-SNP guests can access a special page that contains a table of CPUID values
+that have been validated by the PSP as part of the SNP_LAUNCH_UPDATE firmware
+command. It provides the following assurances regarding the validity of CPUID
+values:
+
+ - Its address is obtained via bootloader/firmware (via CC blob), and those
+   binaries will be measured as part of the SEV-SNP attestation report.
+ - Its initial state will be encrypted/pvalidated, so attempts to modify
+   it during run-time will result in garbage being written, or #VC exceptions
+   being generated due to changes in validation state if the hypervisor tries
+   to swap the backing page.
+ - Attempts to bypass PSP checks by the hypervisor by using a normal page, or
+   a non-CPUID encrypted page will change the measurement provided by the
+   SEV-SNP attestation report.
+ - The CPUID page contents are *not* measured, but attempts to modify the
+   expected contents of a CPUID page as part of guest initialization will be
+   gated by the PSP CPUID enforcement policy checks performed on the page
+   during SNP_LAUNCH_UPDATE, and noticeable later if the guest owner
+   implements their own checks of the CPUID values.
+
+It is important to note that this last assurance is only useful if the kernel
+has taken care to make use of the SEV-SNP CPUID throughout all stages of boot.
+Otherwise, guest owner attestation provides no assurance that the kernel wasn't
+fed incorrect values at some point during boot.
+

+
+The driver is based on SEV-SNP firmware spec 0.9 and GHCB spec version 2.0.

-	  SEV-SNP firmware provides the guest a mechanism to communicate with
-	  the PSP without risk from a malicious hypervisor who wishes to read,
-	  alter, drop or replay the messages sent. The driver provides
-	  userspace interface to communicate with the PSP to request the
-	  attestation report and more.

-	  If you choose 'M' here, this module will be called sevguest.
