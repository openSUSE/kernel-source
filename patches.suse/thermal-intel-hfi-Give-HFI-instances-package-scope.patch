Subject: [PATCH] thermal: intel: hfi: Give HFI instances package scope
Git-commit: b755367602d70deade956cbe0b8a3f5a12f569dc
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
References: stable-fixes

The Intel Software Developer's Manual defines the scope of HFI (registers
and memory buffer) as a package. Use package scope(*) in the software
representation of an HFI instance.

Using die scope in HFI instances has the effect of creating multiple
conflicting instances for the same package: each instance allocates its
own memory buffer and configures the same package-level registers.
Specifically, only one of the allocated memory buffers can be set in the
MSR_IA32_HW_FEEDBACK_PTR register. CPUs get incorrect HFI data from the
table.

The problem does not affect current HFI-capable platforms because they
all have single-die processors.

(*) We used die scope for HFI instances because there had been
    processors with packages enumerated as dies. None of those systems
    supported HFI, though. If such a system emerged, it would need to
    be quirked.
