Subject: drm/i915: Note the addition of timeslicing to the pretend scheduler
Git-commit: 9c4a14f8cceeffa01334e3229888746aa7dd95fe
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: bsc#1152489

Since writing the comment that the scheduler is entirely passive, we've
added minimal timeslicing which adds the most primitive of active
elements (a timeout and reschedule).
