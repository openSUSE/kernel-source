Subject: [PATCH] sched/fair: Improve consistency of allowed NUMA balance
 calculations

References: bsc#1192120
Patch-mainline: Not yet, posted but review pending

There are inconsistencies when determining if a NUMA imbalance is allowed
that should be corrected.

o allow_numa_imbalance changes types and is not always examining
  the destination group so both the type should be corrected as
  well as the naming.
o find_idlest_group uses the sched_domain's weight instead of the
  group weight which is different to find_busiest_group
o find_busiest_group uses the source group instead of the destination
  which is different to task_numa_find_cpu
o Both find_idlest_group and find_busiest_group should account
  for the number of running tasks if a move was allowed to be
  consistent with task_numa_find_cpu
