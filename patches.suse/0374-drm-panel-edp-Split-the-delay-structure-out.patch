Subject: drm/panel-edp: Split the delay structure out
Git-commit: 9ea10a500045767039b2c408738b1c324d7fc4c3
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

In the case where we can read an EDID for a panel the only part of the
panel description that can't be found directly from the EDID is the
description of the delays. Let's break the delay structure out so that
we can specify just the delays for panels that are detected by EDID.

This is simple code motion. No functional change is intended.
