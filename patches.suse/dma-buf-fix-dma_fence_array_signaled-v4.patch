Subject: [PATCH] dma-buf: fix dma_fence_array_signaled v4
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-transfer-encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: 78ac1c3558810486d90aa533b0039aa70487a3da
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc2
References: stable-fixes

The function silently assumed that signaling was already enabled for the
dma_fence_array. This meant that without enabling signaling first we would
never see forward progress.

Fix that by falling back to testing each individual fence when signaling
isn't enabled yet.

V2: add the comment suggested by Boris why this is done this way
V3: fix the underflow pointed out by Tvrtko
V4: atomic_read_acquire() as suggested by Tvrtko
