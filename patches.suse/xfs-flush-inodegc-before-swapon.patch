Subject: [PATCH] xfs: flush inodegc before swapon
Git-commit: 2d873efd174bae9005776937d5ac6a96050266db
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc4
References: git-fixes

Fix the brand new xfstest that tries to swapon on a recently unshared
file and use the chance to document the other bit of magic in this
function.

The big comment is taken from a mailinglist post by Dave Chinner.
