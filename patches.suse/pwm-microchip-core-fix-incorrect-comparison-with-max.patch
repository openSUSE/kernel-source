Subject: [PATCH] pwm: microchip-core: fix incorrect comparison with max period

References: git-fixes

In mchp_core_pwm_apply_locked(), if hw_period_steps is equal to its max,
an error is reported and .apply fails. The max value is actually a
permitted value however, and so this check can fail where multiple
channels are enabled.

For example, the first channel to be configured requests a period that
sets hw_period_steps to the maximum value, and when a second channel
is enabled the driver reads hw_period_steps back from the hardware and
finds it to be the maximum possible value, triggering the warning on a
permitted value. The value to be avoided is 255 (PERIOD_STEPS_MAX + 1),
as that will produce undesired behaviour, so test for greater than,
rather than equal to.
