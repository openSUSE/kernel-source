Subject: [PATCH] serial: 8250: Fall back to non-DMA Rx if IIR_RDI occurs

References: git-fixes

DW UART sometimes triggers IIR_RDI during DMA Rx when IIR_RX_TIMEOUT
should have been triggered instead. Since IIR_RDI has higher priority
than IIR_RX_TIMEOUT, this causes the Rx to hang into interrupt loop.
The problem seems to occur at least with some combinations of
small-sized transfers (I've reproduced the problem on Elkhart Lake PSE
UARTs).

If there's already an on-going Rx DMA and IIR_RDI triggers, fall
graciously back to non-DMA Rx. That is, behave as if IIR_RX_TIMEOUT had
occurred.

8250_omap already considers IIR_RDI similar to this change so its
nothing unheard of.
