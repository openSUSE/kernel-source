Subject: Emulate BLKRRPART on device-mapper
Patch-mainline: not yet, <REASON NEEDED>

Partitions on device-mapper devices are managed by kpartx (if at
all). So if we were just to send out a 'change' event if someone
called BLKRRPART on these devices, kpartx will be triggered via udev
and can manage the partitions accordingly.
