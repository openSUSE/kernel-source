Subject: [PATCH] driver core: faux: only create the device if probe() succeeds
Git-commit: 21b0dc55bed6d9b5dd5d1ad22b75d9d1c7426bbc
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc1
References: jsc#PED-14430 jsc#PED-14297 jsc#PED-14024

It's really hard to know if a faux device properly passes the callback
to probe() without having to poke around in the faux_device structure
and then clean up.  Instead of having to have every user of the api do
this logic, just do it in the faux device core itself.

This makes the use of a custom probe() callback for a faux device much
simpler overall.
