Subject: drm/i915/guc/slpc: Remove BUG_ON in guc_submission_disable
Git-commit: db301cffd8a285bbe73879671e6d666a0b654138
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

The assumption when it was added was that GT would not be
holding any gt_pm references. However, uc_init is called
from gt_init_hw, which holds a forcewake ref. If SLPC
enable fails, we will still be holding this ref, which will
result in the BUG_ON.
