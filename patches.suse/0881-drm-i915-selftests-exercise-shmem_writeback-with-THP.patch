    shmem: shmem_writepage() split unlikely i915 THP

it looks THP + shmem_writeback was an unexpected combination, and ends up
hitting some BUG_ON, but it also looks like that is now fixed.

While the IGTs did eventually hit this(although not during pre-merge it
seems), it's likely worthwhile adding some explicit coverage for this
scenario in the shrink_thp selftest.
