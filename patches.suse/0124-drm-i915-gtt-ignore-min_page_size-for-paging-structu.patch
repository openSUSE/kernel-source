Subject: drm/i915/gtt: ignore min_page_size for paging structures
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: 32334c9b1fd78ad661582c55b15d263a5d6d157d
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

The min_page_size is only needed for pages inserted into the GTT, and
for our paging structures we only need at most 4K bytes, so simply
ignore the min_page_size restrictions here, otherwise we might see some
severe overallocation on some devices.

v2(Thomas): add some commentary
