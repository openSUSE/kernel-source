Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: fix race between logging inode and checking if it was
 logged before
Git-commit: ef07b74e1be56f9eafda6aadebb9ebba0743c9f0
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc5
References: git-fixes

There's a race between checking if an inode was logged before and logging
an inode that can cause us to mark an inode as not logged just after it
was logged by a concurrent task:

1) We have inode X which was not logged before neither in the current
   transaction not in past transaction since the inode was loaded into
   memory, so it's ->logged_trans value is 0;

2) We are at transaction N;

3) Task A calls inode_logged() against inode X, sees that ->logged_trans
   is 0 and there is a log tree and so it proceeds to search in the log
   tree for an inode item for inode X. It doesn't see any, but before
   it sets ->logged_trans to N - 1...

3) Task B calls btrfs_log_inode() against inode X, logs the inode and
   sets ->logged_trans to N;

4) Task A now sets ->logged_trans to N - 1;

5) At this point anyone calling inode_logged() gets 0 (inode not logged)
   since ->logged_trans is greater than 0 and less than N, but our inode
   was really logged. As a consequence operations like rename, unlink and
   link that happen afterwards in the current transaction end up not
   updating the log when they should.

Fix this by ensuring inode_logged() only updates ->logged_trans in case
the inode item is not found in the log tree if after tacking the inode's
lock (spinlock struct btrfs_inode::lock) the ->logged_trans value is still
zero, since the inode lock is what protects setting ->logged_trans at
btrfs_log_inode().
