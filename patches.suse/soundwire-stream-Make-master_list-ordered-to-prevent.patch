Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: stream: Make master_list ordered to prevent deadlocks
Git-commit: a4857d1afdd1fa7ff763e1d07b1c2db521a5f9b1
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc1
References: jsc#PED-6045 jsc#PED-6036 jsc#PED-6104 jsc#PED-6114 jsc#PED-6067 jsc#PED-6123

Always add buses to the stream->master_list in a fixed order.
The unique bus->id is used to order the adding of buses to the
list.

This prevents lockdep asserts and possible deadlocks on streams
that have multiple buses.

sdw_acquire_bus_lock() takes bus_lock in the order that buses
are listed in stream->master_list. do_bank_switch() takes all
the msg_lock in the same order.

To prevent a lockdep assert, and a possible real deadlock, the
relative order of taking these mutexes must always be the same.

For example, if a stream takes the mutexes in the order
(bus0, bus1) lockdep will assert if another stream takes them
in the order (bus1, bus0).

More complex relative ordering will also assert, for example
if two streams take (bus0, bus1) and (bus1, bus2), then a third
stream takes (bus2, bus0).

Previously sdw_stream_add_master() simply added the given bus
to the end of the list, requiring the caller to guarantee that
buses are added in a fixed order. This isn't reasonable or
necessary - it's an internal implementation detail that should
not be exposed by the API. It doesn't really make sense when
there could be multiple independent calling drivers, to say
"you must add your buses in the same order as a different driver,
that you don't know about, added them".
