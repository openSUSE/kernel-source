Subject: [PATCH] HID: nintendo: Wait longer for initial probe
Git-commit: b73bc6a51f0c0066912c7e181acee41091c70fe6
Patch-mainline: v6.18-rc2
References: stable-fixes

Some third-party controllers, such as the PB Tails CHOC, won't always
respond quickly on startup. Since this packet is needed for probe, and only
once during probe, let's just wait an extra second, which makes connecting
consistent.
