Subject: drm/i915/gt: Give engine->kernel_context distinct timeline lock
 classes
Git-commit: 6ad145fe0246abe31a312ce19321bb5b11635802
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: bsc#1152489

Assign a separate lockclass to the perma-pinned timelines of the
kernel_context, such that we can use them from within the user timelines
should we ever need to inject GPU operations to fixup faults during
request construction.
