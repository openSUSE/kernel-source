Subject: [PATCH] PCI: aardvark: Set PCI Bridge Class Code to PCI Bridge
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-transfer-encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: 84e1b4045dc887b78bdc87d92927093dc3a465aa
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: git-fixes stable-5.14.19

Aardvark controller has something like config space of a Root Port
available at offset 0x0 of internal registers - these registers are used
for implementation of the emulated bridge.

The default value of Class Code of this bridge corresponds to a RAID Mass
storage controller, though. (This is probably intended for when the
controller is used as Endpoint.)

Change the Class Code to correspond to a PCI Bridge.

Add comment explaining this change.
