Subject: [PATCH] docs: ABI: sysfs-devices-soc: Fix swapped sample values
Git-commit: 2f4ca87469b9499eb9218cf2a374018cfee6b649
Patch-mainline: v6.19-rc5
References: git-fixes

The sample values for `family` and `machine` were swapped relative to
what the driver actually does, and doesn't match the field description.
