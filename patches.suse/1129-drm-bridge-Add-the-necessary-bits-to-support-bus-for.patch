Subject: drm/bridge: Add the necessary bits to support bus format negotiation
Git-commit: e351e4d5eaec713b2d4780c79f68702e88f2a212
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-12680, jsc#SLE-12880, jsc#SLE-12882, jsc#SLE-12883, jsc#SLE-13496, jsc#SLE-15322

drm_bridge_state is extended to describe the input and output bus
configurations. These bus configurations are exposed through the
drm_bus_cfg struct which encodes the configuration of a physical
bus between two components in an output pipeline, usually between
two bridges, an encoder and a bridge, or a bridge and a connector.

The bus configuration is stored in drm_bridge_state separately for
the input and output buses, as seen from the point of view of each
bridge. The bus configuration of a bridge output is usually identical
to the configuration of the next bridge's input, but may differ if
the signals are modified between the two bridges, for instance by an
inverter on the board. The input and output configurations of a
bridge may differ if the bridge modifies the signals internally,
for instance by performing format conversion, or*modifying signals
polarities.

Bus format negotiation is automated by the core, drivers just have
to implement the ->atomic_get_{output,input}_bus_fmts() hooks if they
want to take part to this negotiation. Negotiation happens in reverse
order, starting from the last element of the chain (the one directly
connected to the display) up to the first element of the chain (the one
connected to the encoder).
During this negotiation all supported formats are tested until we find
one that works, meaning that the formats array should be in decreasing
preference order (assuming the driver has a preference order).

Note that the bus format negotiation works even if some elements in the
chain don't implement the ->atomic_get_{output,input}_bus_fmts() hooks.
In that case, the core advertises only MEDIA_BUS_FMT_FIXED and lets
the previous bridge element decide what to do (most of the time, bridge
drivers will pick a default bus format or extract this piece of
information from somewhere else, like a FW property).

+ * This function is called by &drm_atomic_bridge_chain_check() just before

+ * It performs bus format negotiation between bridge elements. The negotiation
+ * happens in reverse order, starting from the last element in the chain up to
+ * @bridge.
+ *
+ * Negotiation starts by retrieving supported output bus formats on the last
+ * bridge element and testing them one by one. The test is recursive, meaning
+ * that for each tested output format, the whole chain will be walked backward,
+ * and each element will have to choose an input bus format that can be
+ * transcoded to the requested output format. When a bridge element does not
+ * support transcoding into a specific output format -ENOTSUPP is returned and
+ * the next bridge element will have to try a different format. If none of the
+ * combinations worked, -ENOTSUPP is returned and the atomic modeset will fail.
+ *
+ * This implementation is relying on
+ * &drm_bridge_funcs.atomic_get_output_bus_fmts() and
+ * &drm_bridge_funcs.atomic_get_input_bus_fmts() to gather supported
+ * input/output formats.
+ *
+ * When &drm_bridge_funcs.atomic_get_output_bus_fmts() is not implemented by
+ * the last element of the chain, &drm_atomic_bridge_chain_select_bus_fmts()
+ * tries a single format: &drm_connector.display_info.bus_formats[0] if
+ * available, MEDIA_BUS_FMT_FIXED otherwise.
+ *
+ * When &drm_bridge_funcs.atomic_get_input_bus_fmts() is not implemented,
+ * &drm_atomic_bridge_chain_select_bus_fmts() skips the negotiation on the
+ * bridge element that lacks this hook and asks the previous element in the
+ * chain to try MEDIA_BUS_FMT_FIXED. It's up to bridge drivers to decide what
+ * to do in that case (fail if they want to enforce bus format negotiation, or
+ * provide a reasonable default if they need to support pipelines where not
