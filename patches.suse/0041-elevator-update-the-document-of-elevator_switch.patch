Subject: [PATCH] elevator: update the document of elevator_switch
Git-commit: ac1171bd2c7a3a32dfbdd3c347919fee32b745a1
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc1
References: git-fixes

We no longer support falling back to the old io scheduler if switching to
the new one fails. Update the document to indicate that.

(Coly Li: refreshed for Linux v5.14 based SUSE kernel)
