Subject: [PATCH] xfs: fix parent pointer scrubber bailing out on unallocated
 inodes
Git-commit: da531cc46ef16301b1bc5bc74acbaacc628904f5
Patch-mainline: v5.11-rc1
References: git-fixes bsc#1182276

xfs_iget can return -ENOENT for a file that the inobt thinks is
allocated but has zeroed mode.  This currently causes scrub to exit
with an operational error instead of flagging this as a corruption.  The
end result is that scrub mistakenly reports the ENOENT to the user
instead of "directory parent pointer corrupt" like we do for EINVAL.

Fixes: 5927268f5a04 ("xfs: flag inode corruption if parent ptr doesn't get us a real inode")
