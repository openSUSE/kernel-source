Subject: x86/sme: Use #define USE_EARLY_PGTABLE_L5 in mem_encrypt_identity.c
Git-commit: e7d445ab26db833d6640d4c9a08bee176777cc82
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: bsc#1152489

When runtime support for converting between 4-level and 5-level pagetables
was added to the kernel, the SME code that built pagetables was updated
to use the pagetable functions, e.g. p4d_offset(), etc., in order to
simplify the code. However, the use of the pagetable functions in early
boot code requires the use of the USE_EARLY_PGTABLE_L5 #define in order to
ensure that the proper definition of pgtable_l5_enabled() is used.

Without the #define, pgtable_l5_enabled() is #defined as
cpu_feature_enabled(X86_FEATURE_LA57). In early boot, the CPU features
have not yet been discovered and populated, so pgtable_l5_enabled() will
return false even when 5-level paging is enabled. This causes the SME code
to always build 4-level pagetables to perform the in-place encryption.
If 5-level paging is enabled, switching to the SME pagetables results in
a page-fault that kills the boot.

Adding the #define results in pgtable_l5_enabled() using the
__pgtable_l5_enabled variable set in early boot and the SME code building
pagetables for the proper paging level.
