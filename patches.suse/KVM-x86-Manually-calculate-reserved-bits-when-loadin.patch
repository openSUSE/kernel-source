Subject: KVM: x86: Manually calculate reserved bits when loading PDPTRS
Git-commit: 16cfacc8085782dab8e365979356ce1ca87fd6cc
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc1
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.4

Manually generate the PDPTR reserved bit mask when explicitly loading
PDPTRs.  The reserved bits that are being tracked by the MMU reflect the
current paging mode, which is unlikely to be PAE paging in the vast
majority of flows that use load_pdptrs(), e.g. CR0 and CR4 emulation,
__set_sregs(), etc...  This can cause KVM to incorrectly signal a bad
PDPTR, or more likely, miss a reserved bit check and subsequently fail
a VM-Enter due to a bad VMCS.GUEST_PDPTR.

Add a one off helper to generate the reserved bits instead of sharing
code across the MMU's calculations and the PDPTR emulation.  The PDPTR
reserved bits are basically set in stone, and pushing a helper into
the MMU's calculation adds unnecessary complexity without improving
readability.

Oppurtunistically fix/update the comment for load_pdptrs().

Note, the buggy commit also introduced a deliberate functional change,
"Also remove bit 5-6 from rsvd_bits_mask per latest SDM.", which was
effectively (and correctly) reverted by commit cd9ae5fe47df ("KVM: x86:
Fix page-tables reserved bits").  A bit of SDM archaeology shows that
the SDM from late 2008 had a bug (likely a copy+paste error) where it
listed bits 6:5 as AVL and A for PDPTEs used for 4k entries but reserved
for 2mb entries.  I.e. the SDM contradicted itself, and bits 6:5 are and
always have been reserved.
