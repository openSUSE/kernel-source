Subject: mm: add generic p?d_leaf() macros
Git-commit: 93fab1b22ef7c4abcbc760ce4432762b02e7f3d1
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-16387

Patch series "Generic page walk and ptdump", v17.

Many architectures current have a debugfs file for dumping the kernel page
tables.  Currently each architecture has to implement custom functions for
this because the details of walking the page tables used by the kernel are
different between architectures.

This series extends the capabilities of walk_page_range() so that it can
deal with the page tables of the kernel (which have no VMAs and can
contain larger huge pages than exist for user space).  A generic PTDUMP
implementation is the implemented making use of the new functionality of
walk_page_range() and finally arm64 and x86 are switch to using it,
removing the custom table walkers.

To enable a generic page table walker to walk the unusual mappings of the
kernel we need to implement a set of functions which let us know when the
walker has reached the leaf entry.  After a suggestion from Will Deacon
I've chosen the name p?d_leaf() as this (hopefully) describes the purpose
(and is a new name so has no historic baggage).  Some architectures have
p?d_large macros but this is easily confused with "large pages".

This series ends with a generic PTDUMP implemention for arm64 and x86.

Mostly this is a clean up and there should be very little functional
change.  The exceptions are:

* arm64 PTDUMP debugfs now displays pages which aren't present (patch 22).

* arm64 has the ability to efficiently process KASAN pages (which
  previously only x86 implemented).  This means that the combination of
  KASAN and DEBUG_WX is now useable.

This patch (of 23):

Exposing the pud/pgd levels of the page tables to walk_page_range() means
we may come across the exotic large mappings that come with large areas of
contiguous memory (such as the kernel's linear map).

For architectures that don't provide all p?d_leaf() macros, provide
generic do nothing default that are suitable where there cannot be leaf
pages at that level.  Futher patches will add implementations for
individual architectures.

The name p?d_leaf() is chosen to minimize the confusion with existing uses
of "large" pages and "huge" pages which do not necessary mean that the
entry is a leaf (for example it may be a set of contiguous entries that
only take 1 TLB slot).  For the purpose of walking the page tables we
don't need to know how it will be represented in the TLB, but we do need
to know for sure if it is a leaf of the tree.
