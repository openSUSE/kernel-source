Subject: [PATCH] jbd2: do not clear the BH_Mapped flag when forgetting a
 metadata buffer
Git-commit: c96dceeabf765d0b1b1f29c3bf50a5c01315b820
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc2
References: bsc#1163836

Commit 904cdbd41d74 ("jbd2: clear dirty flag when revoking a buffer from
an older transaction") set the BH_Freed flag when forgetting a metadata
buffer which belongs to the committing transaction, it indicate the
committing process clear dirty bits when it is done with the buffer. But
it also clear the BH_Mapped flag at the same time, which may trigger
below NULL pointer oops when block_size < PAGE_SIZE.

                      __journal_remove_journal_head(hb1)
		       jh1 is NULL and trigger oops

*) Dir entry block bh1 and bh2 belongs to one page, and the bh2 has
   already been unmapped.

For the metadata buffer we forgetting, we should always keep the mapped
flag and clear the dirty flags is enough, so this patch pick out the
these buffers and keep their BH_Mapped flag.
