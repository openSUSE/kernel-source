Subject: [PATCH] clocksource: Set cs_watchdog_read() checks based on
 .uncertainty_margin
Git-commit: 4ac1dd3245b9067f929ab30141bb0475e9e32fc5
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc1
References: bsc#1236872

Right now, cs_watchdog_read() does clocksource sanity checks based
on WATCHDOG_MAX_SKEW, which sets a floor on any clocksource's
.uncertainty_margin.  These sanity checks can therefore act
inappropriately for clocksources with large uncertainty margins.

One reason for a clocksource to have a large .uncertainty_margin is when
that clocksource has long read-out latency, given that it does not make
sense for the .uncertainty_margin to be smaller than the read-out latency.
With the current checks, cs_watchdog_read() could reject all normal
reads from a clocksource with long read-out latencies, such as those
from legacy clocksources that are no longer implemented in hardware.

Therefore, recast the cs_watchdog_read() checks in terms of the
.uncertainty_margin values of the clocksources involved in the timespan in
question.  The first covers two watchdog reads and one cs read, so use
twice the watchdog .uncertainty_margin plus that of the cs.  The second
covers only a pair of watchdog reads, so use twice the watchdog
.uncertainty_margin.
