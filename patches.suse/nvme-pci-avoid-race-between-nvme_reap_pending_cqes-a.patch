Subject: [PATCH] nvme-pci: avoid race between nvme_reap_pending_cqes() and
 nvme_poll()
Git-commit: 9210c075cef29c1f764b4252f93105103bdfb292
Patch-mainline: v5.7
References: git-fixes

There may be a race between nvme_reap_pending_cqes() and nvme_poll(), e.g.,
when doing live reset while polling the nvme device.

      CPU X                        CPU Y
                               nvme_poll()
nvme_dev_disable()
-> nvme_stop_queues()
-> nvme_suspend_io_queues()
-> nvme_suspend_queue()
                               -> spin_lock(&nvmeq->cq_poll_lock);
-> nvme_reap_pending_cqes()
   -> nvme_process_cq()        -> nvme_process_cq()

In the above scenario, the nvme_process_cq() for the same queue may be
running on both CPU X and CPU Y concurrently.

It is much more easier to reproduce the issue when CONFIG_PREEMPT is
enabled in kernel. When CONFIG_PREEMPT is disabled, it would take longer
time for nvme_stop_queues()-->blk_mq_quiesce_queue() to wait for grace
period.

This patch protects nvme_process_cq() with nvmeq->cq_poll_lock in
nvme_reap_pending_cqes().
