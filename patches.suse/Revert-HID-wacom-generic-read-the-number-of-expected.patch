Subject: [PATCH] Revert "HID: wacom: generic: read the number of expected touches on a per collection basis"
Git-commit: b43f977dd281945960c26b3ef67bba0fa07d39d9
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc5
References: git-fixes

This reverts commit 15893fa40109f5e7c67eeb8da62267d0fdf0be9d.

The referenced commit broke pen and touch input for a variety of devices
such as the Cintiq Pro 32. Affected devices may appear to work normally
for a short amount of time, but eventually loose track of actual touch
state and can leave touch arbitration enabled which prevents the pen
from working. The commit is not itself required for any currently-available
Bluetooth device, and so we revert it to correct the behavior of broken
devices.

This breakage occurs due to a mismatch between the order of collections
and the order of usages on some devices. This commit tries to read the
contact count before processing events, but will fail if the contact
count does not occur prior to the first logical finger collection. This
is the case for devices like the Cintiq Pro 32 which place the contact
count at the very end of the report.

Without the contact count set, touches will only be partially processed.
The `wacom_wac_finger_slot` function will not open any slots since the
number of contacts seen is greater than the expectation of 0, but we will
still end up calling `input_mt_sync_frame` for each finger anyway. This
can cause problems for userspace separate from the issue currently taking
place in the kernel. Only once all of the individual finger collections
have been processed do we finally get to the enclosing collection which
contains the contact count. The value ends up being used for the *next*
report, however.

This delayed use of the contact count can cause the driver to loose track
of the actual touch state and believe that there are contacts down when
there aren't. This leaves touch arbitration enabled and prevents the pen
from working. It can also cause userspace to incorrectly treat single-
finger input as gestures.
