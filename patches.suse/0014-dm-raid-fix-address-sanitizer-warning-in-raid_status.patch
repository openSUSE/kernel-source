Subject: [PATCH] dm raid: fix address sanitizer warning in raid_status
Git-commit: 1fbeea217d8f297fe0e0956a1516d14ba97d0396
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: git-fixes

There is this warning when using a kernel with the address sanitizer
and running this testsuite:
https://gitlab.com/cki-project/kernel-tests/-/tree/main/storage/swraid/scsi_raid

Bug: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in raid_status+0x1747/0x2820 [dm_raid]

The warning is caused by reading conf->max_nr_stripes in raid_status. The
code in raid_status reads mddev->private, casts it to struct r5conf and
reads the entry max_nr_stripes.

However, if we have different raid type than 4/5/6, mddev->private
doesn't point to struct r5conf; it may point to struct r0conf, struct
r1conf, struct r10conf or struct mpconf. If we cast a pointer to one
of these structs to struct r5conf, we will be reading invalid memory
and KASAN warns about it.

Fix this bug by reading struct r5conf only if raid type is 4, 5 or 6.
