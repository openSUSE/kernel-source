Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm64: Fix AArch32 register narrowing on userspace write

When userspace writes to one of the core registers, we make
sure to narrow the corresponding GPRs if PSTATE indicates
an AArch32 context.

The code tries to check whether the context is EL0 or EL1 so
that it narrows the correct registers. But it does so by checking
the full PSTATE instead of PSTATE.M.

As a consequence, and if we are restoring an AArch32 EL0 context
in a 64bit guest, and that PSTATE has *any* bit set outside of
PSTATE.M, we narrow *all* registers instead of only the first 15,
destroying the 64bit state.

Obviously, this is not something the guest is likely to enjoy.

Correctly masking PSTATE to only evaluate PSTATE.M fixes it.
