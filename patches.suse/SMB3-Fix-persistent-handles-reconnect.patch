Subject: SMB3: Fix persistent handles reconnect
Git-commit: d243af7ab9feb49f11f2c0050d2077e2d9556f9b
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc7
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.11

When the client hits a network reconnect, it re-opens every open
file with a create context to reconnect a persistent handle. All
create context types should be 8-bytes aligned but the padding
was missed for that one. As a result, some servers don't allow
us to reconnect handles and return an error. The problem occurs
when the problematic context is not at the end of the create
request packet. Fix this by adding a proper padding at the end
of the reconnect persistent handle context.
