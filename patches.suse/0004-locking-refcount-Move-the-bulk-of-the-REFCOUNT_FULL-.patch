Subject: [PATCH 4/9] locking/refcount: Move the bulk of the REFCOUNT_FULL implementation into the <linux/refcount.h> header
Git-commit: 77e9971c79c29542ab7dd4140f9343bf2ff36158
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: bsc#1149032

In an effort to improve performance of the REFCOUNT_FULL implementation,
move the bulk of its functions into linux/refcount.h. This allows them
to be inlined in the same way as if they had been provided via
CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_REFCOUNT.
