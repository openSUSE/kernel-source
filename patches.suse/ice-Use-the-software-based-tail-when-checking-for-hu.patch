Subject: ice: Use the software based tail when checking for hung Tx ring
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
Git-commit: c1ddf1f5c4adc1e885dce8533b2245d979f38280
References: jsc#SLE-7926

Currently in ice_get_tx_pending we try to read a Tx ring's tail. This is
then compared with the software based head (next_to_clean) to determine
if we have pending work. This will never work because reading of the Tx
ring's tail is no longer supported. Fix this by using the software based
tail (next_to_use) to determine if there is pending work.
