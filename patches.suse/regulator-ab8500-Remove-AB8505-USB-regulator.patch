Subject: [PATCH] regulator: ab8500: Remove AB8505 USB regulator
Git-commit: 99c4f70df3a6446c56ca817c2d0f9c12d85d4e7c
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: git-fixes

The USB regulator was removed for AB8500 in
commit 41a06aa738ad ("regulator: ab8500: Remove USB regulator").
It was then added for AB8505 in
commit 547f384f33db ("regulator: ab8500: add support for ab8505").

However, there was never an entry added for it in
ab8505_regulator_match. This causes all regulators after it
to be initialized with the wrong device tree data, eventually
leading to an out-of-bounds array read.

Given that it is not used anywhere in the kernel, it seems
likely that similar arguments against supporting it exist for
AB8505 (it is controlled by hardware).

Therefore, simply remove it like for AB8500 instead of adding
an entry in ab8505_regulator_match.
