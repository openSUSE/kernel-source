Subject: [PATCH] futex: Handle transient "ownerless" rtmutex state correctly
Git-commit: 9f5d1c336a10c0d24e83e40b4c1b9539f7dba627
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc3
References: bsc#1149032

Gratian managed to trigger the BUG_ON(!newowner) in fixup_pi_state_owner().
This is one possible chain of events leading to this:

Task Prio       Operation
T1   120	lock(F)
T2   120	lock(F)   -> blocks (top waiter)
T3   50 (RT)	lock(F)   -> boosts T1 and blocks (new top waiter)
XX   		timeout/  -> wakes T2
		signal
T1   50		unlock(F) -> wakes T3 (rtmutex->owner == NULL, waiter bit is set)
T2   120	cleanup   -> try_to_take_mutex() fails because T3 is the top waiter
     			     and the lower priority T2 cannot steal the lock.
     			  -> fixup_pi_state_owner() sees newowner == NULL -> BUG_ON()

The comment states that this is invalid and rt_mutex_real_owner() must
return a non NULL owner when the trylock failed, but in case of a queued
and woken up waiter rt_mutex_real_owner() == NULL is a valid transient
state. The higher priority waiter has simply not yet managed to take over
the rtmutex.

The BUG_ON() is therefore wrong and this is just another retry condition in
fixup_pi_state_owner().

Drop the locks, so that T3 can make progress, and then try the fixup again.

Gratian provided a great analysis, traces and a reproducer. The analysis is
to the point, but it confused the hell out of that tglx dude who had to
page in all the futex horrors again. Condensed version is above.
