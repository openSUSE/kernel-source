Subject: bpf: Enforce that struct_ops programs be GPL-only

References: bsc#1177028

With the introduction of the struct_ops program type, it became possible to
implement kernel functionality in BPF, making it viable to use BPF in place
of a regular kernel module for these particular operations.

Thus far, the only user of this mechanism is for implementing TCP
congestion control algorithms. These are clearly marked as GPL-only when
implemented as modules (as seen by the use of EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL for
tcp_register_congestion_control()), so it seems like an oversight that this
was not carried over to BPF implementations. Since this is the only user
of the struct_ops mechanism, just enforcing GPL-only for the struct_ops
program type seems like the simplest way to fix this.
