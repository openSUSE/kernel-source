Subject: ice: Implement flow for IPv6 next header (extension header)
Patch-mainline: v5.11-rc6
Git-commit: 1b0b0b581b945ee27beb70e8199270a22dd5a2f6
References: jsc#SLE-12878

This patch is based on a similar change to i40e by Slawomir Laba:
"i40e: Implement flow for IPv6 next header (extension header)".

When a packet contains an IPv6 header with next header which is
an extension header and not a protocol one, the kernel function
skb_transport_header called with such sk_buff will return a
pointer to the extension header and not to the TCP one.

The above explained call caused a problem with packet processing
for skb with encapsulation for tunnel with ICE_TX_CTX_EIPT_IPV6.
The extension header was not skipped at all.

The ipv6_skip_exthdr function does check if next header of the IPV6
header is an extension header and doesn't modify the l4_proto pointer
if it points to a protocol header value so its safe to omit the
comparison of exthdr and l4.hdr pointers. The ipv6_skip_exthdr can
return value -1. This means that the skipping process failed
and there is something wrong with the packet so it will be dropped.
