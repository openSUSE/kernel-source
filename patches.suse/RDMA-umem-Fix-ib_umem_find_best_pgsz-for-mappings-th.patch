 cross a page boundary

It is possible for a single SGL to span an aligned boundary, eg if the SGL
is

  61440 -> 90112

Then the length is 28672, which currently limits the block size to
32k. With a 32k page size the two covering blocks will be:

  32768->65536 and 65536->98304

However, the correct answer is a 128K block size which will span the whole
28672 bytes in a single block.

Instead of limiting based on length figure out which high IOVA bits don't
change between the start and end addresses. That is the highest useful
page size.
