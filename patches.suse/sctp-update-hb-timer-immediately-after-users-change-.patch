Subject: [PATCH] sctp: update hb timer immediately after users change
 hb_interval
Git-commit: 1f4e803cd9c9166eb8b6c8b0b8e4124f7499fc07
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc5
References: bsc#1220419

Currently, when hb_interval is changed by users, it won't take effect
until the next expiry of hb timer. As the default value is 30s, users
have to wait up to 30s to wait its hb_interval update to work.

This becomes pretty bad in containers where a much smaller value is
usually set on hb_interval. This patch improves it by resetting the
hb timer immediately once the value of hb_interval is updated by users.

Note that we don't address the already existing 'problem' when sending
a heartbeat 'on demand' if one hb has just been sent(from the timer)
