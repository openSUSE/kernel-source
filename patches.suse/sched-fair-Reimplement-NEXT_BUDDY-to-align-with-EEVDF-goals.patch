Subject: [PATCH] sched/fair: Reimplement NEXT_BUDDY to align with EEVDF goals

References: bsc#1234634 (Scheduler functional and performance backports)
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
Git-commit: e837456fdca81899a3c8e47b3fd39e30eae6e291
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip.git

Reimplement NEXT_BUDDY preemption to take into account the deadline and
eligibility of the wakee with respect to the waker. In the event
multiple buddies could be considered, the one with the earliest deadline
is selected.

Sync wakeups are treated differently to every other type of wakeup. The
WF_SYNC assumption is that the waker promises to sleep in the very near
future. This is violated in enough cases that WF_SYNC should be treated
as a suggestion instead of a contract. If a waker does go to sleep almost
immediately then the delay in wakeup is negligible. In other cases, it's
throttled based on the accumulated runtime of the waker so there is a
chance that some batched wakeups have been issued before preemption.

For all other wakeups, preemption happens if the wakee has a earlier
deadline than the waker and eligible to run.

While many workloads were tested, the two main targets were a modified
dbench4 benchmark and hackbench because the are on opposite ends of the
spectrum -- one prefers throughput by avoiding preemption and the other
relies on preemption.

First is the dbench throughput data even though it is a poor metric but
it is the default metric. The test machine is a 2-socket machine and the
backing filesystem is XFS as a lot of the IO work is dispatched to kernel
threads. It's important to note that these results are not representative
across all machines, especially Zen machines, as different bottlenecks
are exposed on different machines and filesystems.

As throughput is misleading, the benchmark is modified to use a short
loadfile report the completion time duration in milliseconds.

That is still looking good and the variance is reduced quite a bit.
Finally, fairness is a concern so the next report tracks how many
milliseconds does it take for all clients to complete a workfile. This
one is tricky because dbench makes to effort to synchronise clients so
the durations at benchmark start time differ substantially from typical
runtimes. This problem could be mitigated by warming up the benchmark
for a number of minutes but it's a matter of opinion whether that
counts as an evasion of inconvenient results.

This is more of a mixed bag but it at least shows that fairness
is not crippled.

The hackbench results are more neutral but this is still important.
It's possible to boost the dbench figures by a large amount but only by
crippling the performance of a workload like hackbench. The WF_SYNC
behaviour is important for these workloads and is why the WF_SYNC
changes are not a separate patch.

Processes using pipes are impacted but the variance (not presented) indicates
it's close to noise and the results are not always reproducible. If executed
across multiple reboots, it may show neutral or small gains so the worst
measured results are presented.

Hackbench using sockets is more reliably neutral as the wakeup
mechanisms are different between sockets and pipes.
