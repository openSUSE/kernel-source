Subject: drm/fb-helper: use gem_bo.resv, not dma_buf.resv in prepare_fb

    drm/prime: automatically set gem_obj->resv on import

we consistently set drm_gem_bo.resv for imported buffers. Which means
we don't need to check the dma-buf in the prepare_fb helper, but can
generalize them so they're also useful for display+render drivers
which use gem_bo.resv to track their own rendering for their own
scanout buffers.
