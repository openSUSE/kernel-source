Subject: [PATCH] xfs: preserve default grace interval during quotacheck
Git-commit: 5885539f0af371024d07afd14974bfdc3fff84c5
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: bsc#1172170

When quotacheck runs, it zeroes all the timer fields in every dquot.
Unfortunately, it also does this to the root dquot, which erases any
preconfigured grace intervals and warning limits that the administrator
may have set.  Worse yet, the incore copies of those variables remain
set.  This cache coherence problem manifests itself as the grace
interval mysteriously being reset back to the defaults at the /next/
mount.

Fix it by not resetting the root disk dquot's timer and warning fields.
