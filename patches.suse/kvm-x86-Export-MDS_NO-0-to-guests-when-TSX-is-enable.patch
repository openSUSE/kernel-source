Subject: kvm/x86: Export MDS_NO=0 to guests when TSX is enabled
Git-commit: e1d38b63acd843cfdd4222bf19a26700fd5c699e
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc8
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.11

Export the IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES MSR bit MDS_NO=0 to guests on TSX
Async Abort(TAA) affected hosts that have TSX enabled and updated
microcode. This is required so that the guests don't complain,

  "Vulnerable: Clear CPU buffers attempted, no microcode"

when the host has the updated microcode to clear CPU buffers.

Microcode update also adds support for MSR_IA32_TSX_CTRL which is
enumerated by the ARCH_CAP_TSX_CTRL bit in IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES MSR.
Guests can't do this check themselves when the ARCH_CAP_TSX_CTRL bit is
not exported to the guests.

In this case export MDS_NO=0 to the guests. When guests have
CPUID.MD_CLEAR=1, they deploy MDS mitigation which also mitigates TAA.
