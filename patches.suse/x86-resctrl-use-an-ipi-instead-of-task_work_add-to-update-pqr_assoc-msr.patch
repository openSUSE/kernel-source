Subject: x86/resctrl: Use an IPI instead of task_work_add() to update
 PQR_ASSOC MSR
Git-commit: ae28d1aae48a1258bd09a6f707ebb4231d79a761
Patch-mainline: v5.11-rc3
References: bsc#1152489

Currently, when moving a task to a resource group the PQR_ASSOC MSR is
updated with the new closid and rmid in an added task callback. If the
task is running, the work is run as soon as possible. If the task is not
running, the work is executed later in the kernel exit path when the
kernel returns to the task again.

Updating the PQR_ASSOC MSR as soon as possible on the CPU a moved task
is running is the right thing to do. Queueing work for a task that is
not running is unnecessary (the PQR_ASSOC MSR is already updated when
the task is scheduled in) and causing system resource waste with the way
in which it is implemented: Work to update the PQR_ASSOC register is
queued every time the user writes a task id to the "tasks" file, even if
the task already belongs to the resource group.

This could result in multiple pending work items associated with a
single task even if they are all identical and even though only a single
update with most recent values is needed. Specifically, even if a task
is moved between different resource groups while it is sleeping then it
is only the last move that is relevant but yet a work item is queued
during each move.

This unnecessary queueing of work items could result in significant
system resource waste, especially on tasks sleeping for a long time.
For example, as demonstrated by Shakeel Butt in [1] writing the same
task id to the "tasks" file can quickly consume significant memory. The
same problem (wasted system resources) occurs when moving a task between
different resource groups.

As pointed out by Valentin Schneider in [2] there is an additional issue
with the way in which the queueing of work is done in that the task_struct
update is currently done after the work is queued, resulting in a race with
the register update possibly done before the data needed by the update is
available.

To solve these issues, update the PQR_ASSOC MSR in a synchronous way
right after the new closid and rmid are ready during the task movement,
only if the task is running. If a moved task is not running nothing
is done since the PQR_ASSOC MSR will be updated next time the task is
scheduled. This is the same way used to update the register when tasks
are moved as part of resource group removal.

 [ bp: Massage commit message and drop the two update_task_closid_rmid()
   variants. ]
