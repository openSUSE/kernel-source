Subject: [PATCH] ecryptfs: Reject casefold directory inodes
Git-commit: cd72c7ef5fed44272272a105b1da22810c91be69
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: git-fixes

Even though it seems to be able to resolve some names of
case-insensitive directories, the lack of d_hash and d_compare means we
end up with a broken state in the d_cache.  Considering it was never a
goal to support these two together, and we are preparing to use
d_revalidate in case-insensitive filesystems, which would make the
combination even more broken, reject any attempt to get a casefolded
inode from ecryptfs.
