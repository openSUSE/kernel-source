Subject: Btrfs: fix race leading to metadata space leak after task received
 signal
Git-commit: 0cab7acc4afc0a4b20fd01a9a28971774501db80
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc7
References: bsc#1141456

When a task that is allocating metadata needs to wait for the async
reclaim job to process its ticket and gets a signal (because it was killed
for example) before doing the wait, the task ends up erroring out but
with space reserved for its ticket, which never gets released, resulting
in a metadata space leak (more specifically a leak in the bytes_may_use
counter of the metadata space_info object).

Here's the sequence of steps leading to the space leak:

1) A task tries to create a file for example, so it ends up trying to
   start a transaction at btrfs_create();

2) The filesystem is currently in a state where there is not enough
   metadata free space to satisfy the transaction's needs. So at
   space-info.c:__reserve_metadata_bytes() we create a ticket and
   add it to the list of tickets of the space info object. Also,
   because the metadata async reclaim job is not running, we queue
   a job ro run metadata reclaim;

3) In the meanwhile the task receives a signal (like SIGTERM from
   a kill command for example);

4) After queing the async reclaim job, at __reserve_metadata_bytes(),
   we unlock the metadata space info and call handle_reserve_ticket();

5) That last function calls wait_reserve_ticket(), which acquires the
   lock from the metadata space info. Then in the first iteration of
   its while loop, it calls prepare_to_wait_event(), which returns
   -ERESTARTSYS because the task has a pending signal. As a result,
   we set the error field of the ticket to -EINTR and exit the while
   loop without deleting the ticket from the list of tickets (in the
   space info object). After exiting the loop we unlock the space info;

6) The async reclaim job is able to release enough metadata, acquires
   the metadata space info's lock and then reserves space for the ticket,
   since the ticket is still in the list of (non-priority) tickets. The
   space reservation happens at btrfs_try_granting_tickets(), called from
   maybe_fail_all_tickets(). This increments the bytes_may_use counter
   from the metadata space info object, sets the ticket's bytes field to
   zero (meaning success, that space was reserved) and removes it from
   the list of tickets;

7) wait_reserve_ticket() returns, with the error field of the ticket
   set to -EINTR. Then handle_reserve_ticket() just propagates that error
   to the caller. Because an error was returned, the caller does not
   release the reserved space, since the expectation is that any error
   means no space was reserved.

Fix this by removing the ticket from the list, while holding the space
info lock, at wait_reserve_ticket() when prepare_to_wait_event() returns
an error.

Also add some comments and an assertion to guarantee we never end up with
a ticket that has an error set and a bytes counter field set to zero, to
more easily detect regressions in the future.

This issue could be triggered sporadically by some test cases from fstests
such as generic/269 for example, which tries to fill a filesystem and then
kills fsstress processes running in the background.

When this issue happens, we get a warning in syslog/dmesg when unmounting
the filesystem, like the following:
