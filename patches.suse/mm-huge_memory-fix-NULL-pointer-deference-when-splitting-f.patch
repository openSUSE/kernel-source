Subject: mm/huge_memory: fix NULL pointer deference when splitting folio
Git-commit: cff47b9e39a6abf03dde5f4f156f841b0c54bba0
Patch-mainline: v6.18
References: CVE-2025-68293 bsc#1255150

Commit c010d47f107f ("mm: thp: split huge page to any lower order pages")
introduced an early check on the folio's order via mapping->flags before
proceeding with the split work.

This check introduced a bug: for shmem folios in the swap cache and
truncated folios, the mapping pointer can be NULL.  Accessing
mapping->flags in this state leads directly to a NULL pointer dereference.

This commit fixes the issue by moving the check for mapping != NULL before
any attempt to access mapping->flags.
