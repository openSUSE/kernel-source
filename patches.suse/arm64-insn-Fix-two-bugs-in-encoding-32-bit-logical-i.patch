Subject: arm64: insn: Fix two bugs in encoding 32-bit logical immediates
Git-commit: 579d1b3faa3735e781ff74aac0afd598515dbc63
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
References: bsc#1175186

This patch fixes two issues present in the current function for encoding
arm64 logical immediates when using the 32-bit variants of instructions.

First, the code does not correctly reject an all-ones 32-bit immediate,
and returns an undefined instruction encoding.

Second, the code incorrectly rejects some 32-bit immediates that are
actually encodable as logical immediates. The root cause is that the code
uses a default mask of 64-bit all-ones, even for 32-bit immediates.
This causes an issue later on when the default mask is used to fill the
top bits of the immediate with ones, shown here:

  /*
   * Pattern: 0..01..10..01..1
   *
   * Fill the unused top bits with ones, and check if
   * the result is a valid immediate (all ones with a
   * contiguous ranges of zeroes).
   */
  imm |= ~mask;
  if (!range_of_ones(~imm))
          return AARCH64_BREAK_FAULT;

To see the problem, consider an immediate of the form 0..01..10..01..1,
where the upper 32 bits are zero, such as 0x80000001. The code checks
if ~(imm | ~mask) contains a range of ones: the incorrect mask yields
1..10..01..10..0, which fails the check; the correct mask yields
0..01..10..0, which succeeds.

The fix for both issues is to generate a correct mask based on the
instruction immediate size, and use the mask to check for all-ones,
all-zeroes, and values wider than the mask.

Currently, arch/arm64/kvm/va_layout.c is the only user of this function,
which uses 64-bit immediates and therefore won't trigger these bugs.

We tested the new code against llvm-mc with all 1,302 encodable 32-bit
logical immediates and all 5,334 encodable 64-bit logical immediates.
