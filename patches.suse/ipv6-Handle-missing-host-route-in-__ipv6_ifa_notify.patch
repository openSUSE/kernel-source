Rajendra reported a kernel panic when a link was taken down:

addrconf_dad_work is kicked to be scheduled when a device is brought
up. There is a race between addrcond_dad_work getting scheduled and
taking the rtnl lock and a process taking the link down (under rtnl).
The latter removes the host route from the inet6_addr as part of
addrconf_ifdown which is run for NETDEV_DOWN. The former attempts
to use the host route in __ipv6_ifa_notify. If the down event removes
the host route due to the race to the rtnl, then the BUG listed above
occurs.

Since the DAD sequence can not be aborted, add a check for the missing
host route in __ipv6_ifa_notify. The only way this should happen is due
to the previously mentioned race. The host route is created when the
address is added to an interface; it is only removed on a down event
where the address is kept. Add a warning if the host route is missing
AND the device is up; this is a situation that should never happen.
