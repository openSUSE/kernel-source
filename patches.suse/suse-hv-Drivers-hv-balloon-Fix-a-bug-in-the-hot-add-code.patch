Subject: Drivers: hv: balloon: Fix a bug in the hot-add code
References: bnc#829539

As we hot-add 128 MB chunks of memory, we wait to ensure that the memory
is onlined before attempting to hot-add the next chunk. If the udev rule for
memory hot-add is not executed within the allowed time, we would rollback the
state and abort further hot-add. Since the hot-add has succeeded and the only
failure is that the memory is not onlined within the allowed time, we should not
be rolling back the state. Fix this bug.
