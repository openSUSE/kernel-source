Subject: libbpf: Don't error out on CO-RE relos for overriden weak subprogs
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
Git-commit: e89d57d938c8fa80c457982154ed6110804814fe
References: jsc#PED-1368

During BPF static linking, all the ELF relocations and .BTF.ext
information (including CO-RE relocations) are preserved for __weak
subprograms that were logically overriden by either previous weak
subprogram instance or by corresponding "strong" (non-weak) subprogram.
This is just how native user-space linkers work, nothing new.

But libbpf is over-zealous when processing CO-RE relocation to error out
when CO-RE relocation belonging to such eliminated weak subprogram is
encountered. Instead of erroring out on this expected situation, log
debug-level message and skip the relocation.

Fixes: db2b8b06423c ("libbpf: Support CO-RE relocations for multi-prog sections")
