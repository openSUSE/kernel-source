Subject: s390/cio: add cond_resched() in the slow_eval_known_fn() loop
Git-commit: 0b8eb2ee9da1e8c9b8082f404f3948aa82a057b2
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc2
References: bsc#1177799 LTC#188733

The scanning through subchannels during the time of an event could
take significant amount of time in case of platforms with lots of
known subchannels. This might result in higher scheduling latencies
for other tasks especially on systems with a single CPU. Add
cond_resched() call, as the loop in slow_eval_known_fn() can be
executed for a longer duration.
