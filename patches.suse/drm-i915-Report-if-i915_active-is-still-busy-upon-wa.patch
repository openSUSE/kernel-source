Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: Report if i915_active is still busy upon waiting
Git-commit: afd1bcd4ad776a9892ce6e814111af22dae44956
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-7953

If we try to wait on an i915_active from within a critical section, it
will remain busy (such as if we are shrinking from within
i915_active_ref). Report the failure so that we do not proceed thinking
it is idle.

Extracted from a future patch "drm/i915: Coordinate i915_active with its
own mutex".

Fixes: 12c255b5dad1 ("drm/i915: Provide an i915_active.acquire callback")
