Subject: IB/hfi1: Don't cancel unused work item
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc6
Git-commit: ca9033ba69c7e3477f207df69867b2ea969197c8
References: jsc#SLE-8449

In the iowait structure, two iowait_work entries were included to queue a
given object: one for normal IB operations, and the other for TID RDMA
operations. For non-TID RDMA operations, the iowait_work structure for TID
RDMA is initialized to contain a NULL function (not used). When the QP is
reset, the function iowait_cancel_work will be called to cancel any
pending work. The problem is that this function will call
cancel_work_sync() for both iowait_work entries, even though the one for
TID RDMA is not used at all. Eventually, the call cascades to
__flush_work(), wherein a WARN_ON will be triggered due to the fact that
work->func is NULL.

The WARN_ON was introduced in commit 4d43d395fed1 ("workqueue: Try to
catch flush_work() without INIT_WORK().")

This patch fixes the issue by making sure that a work function is present
for TID RDMA before calling cancel_work_sync in iowait_cancel_work.

Fixes: 4d43d395fed1 ("workqueue: Try to catch flush_work() without INIT_WORK().")
Fixes: 5da0fc9dbf89 ("IB/hfi1: Prepare resource waits for dual leg")
