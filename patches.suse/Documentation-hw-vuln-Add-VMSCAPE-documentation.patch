+VMSCAPE
+=======
+
+VMSCAPE is a vulnerability that may allow a guest to influence the branch
+prediction in host userspace. It particularly affects hypervisors like QEMU.
+
+Even if a hypervisor may not have any sensitive data like disk encryption keys,
+guest-userspace may be able to attack the guest-kernel using the hypervisor as
+a confused deputy.
+
+Affected processors
+-------------------
+
+The following CPU families are affected by VMSCAPE:
+
+**Intel processors:**
+  - Skylake generation (Parts without Enhanced-IBRS)
+  - Cascade Lake generation - (Parts affected by ITS guest/host separation)
+  - Alder Lake and newer (Parts affected by BHI)
+
+Note that, BHI affected parts that use BHB clearing software mitigation e.g.
+Icelake are not vulnerable to VMSCAPE.
+
+**AMD processors:**
+  - Zen series (families 0x17, 0x19, 0x1a)
+
+** Hygon processors:**
+ - Family 0x18
+
+Mitigation
+----------
+
+Conditional IBPB
+----------------
+
+Kernel tracks when a CPU has run a potentially malicious guest and issues an
+IBPB before the first exit to userspace after VM-exit. If userspace did not run
+between VM-exit and the next VM-entry, no IBPB is issued.
+
+Note that the existing userspace mitigation against Spectre-v2 is effective in
+protecting the userspace. They are insufficient to protect the userspace VMMs
+from a malicious guest. This is because Spectre-v2 mitigations are applied at
+context switch time, while the userspace VMM can run after a VM-exit without a
+context switch.
+
+Vulnerability enumeration and mitigation is not applied inside a guest. This is
+because nested hypervisors should already be deploying IBPB to isolate
+themselves from nested guests.
+
+SMT considerations
+------------------
+
+When Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT) is enabled, hypervisors can be
+vulnerable to cross-thread attacks. For complete protection against VMSCAPE
+attacks in SMT environments, STIBP should be enabled.
+
+The kernel will issue a warning if SMT is enabled without adequate STIBP
+protection. Warning is not issued when:
+
+- SMT is disabled
+- STIBP is enabled system-wide
+- Intel eIBRS is enabled (which implies STIBP protection)
+
+System information and options
+------------------------------
+
+The sysfs file showing VMSCAPE mitigation status is:
+
+  /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/vmscape
+
+The possible values in this file are:
+
+ * 'Not affected':
+
+   The processor is not vulnerable to VMSCAPE attacks.
+
+ * 'Vulnerable':
+
+   The processor is vulnerable and no mitigation has been applied.
+
+ * 'Mitigation: IBPB before exit to userspace':
+
+   Conditional IBPB mitigation is enabled. The kernel tracks when a CPU has
+   run a potentially malicious guest and issues an IBPB before the first
+   exit to userspace after VM-exit.
+
+ * 'Mitigation: IBPB on VMEXIT':
+
+   IBPB is issued on every VM-exit. This occurs when other mitigations like
+   RETBLEED or SRSO are already issuing IBPB on VM-exit.
+
+Mitigation control on the kernel command line
+----------------------------------------------
+
+The mitigation can be controlled via the ``vmscape=`` command line parameter:
+
+ * ``vmscape=off``:
+
+   Disable the VMSCAPE mitigation.
+
+ * ``vmscape=ibpb``:
+
+   Enable conditional IBPB mitigation (default when CONFIG_MITIGATION_VMSCAPE=y).
+
+ * ``vmscape=force``:
+
+   Force vulnerability detection and mitigation even on processors that are
+   not known to be affected.
