Subject: [PATCH] KVM: VMX: Don't modify guest XFD_ERR if CR0.TS=1

Don't update the guest's XFD_ERR MSR if CR0.TS is set; per the SDM,
XFD_ERR is not modified if CR0.TS=1.  Although it's not explicitly stated
in the SDM, conceptually it makes sense the CR0.TS check would be done
prior to the XFD_ERR check, e.g. CR0.TS=1 blocks all SIMD state, whereas
XFD blocks only XTILE state.

  Device-not-available exceptions that are not due to XFD - those
  resulting from setting CR0.TS to 1 - do not modify the IA32_XFD_ERR MSR.

Opportunistically update the comment to call out that XFD_ERR is updated
before the VM-Exit check occurs.  Nothing in the SDM explicitly calls out
this behavior, but logically it must be the behavior, otherwise reading
XFD_ERR in handle_nm_fault_irqoff() would return stale data, i.e. the
to-be-delivered XFD_ERR value would need to be saved in EXIT_QUALIFICATION,
a la DR6 for #DB and CR2 for #PF, so that software could capture the guest
value.
