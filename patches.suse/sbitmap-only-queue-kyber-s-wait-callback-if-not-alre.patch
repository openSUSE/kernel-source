Subject: [PATCH] sbitmap: only queue kyber's wait callback if not already active
Git-commit: df034c93f15ee71df231ff9fe311d27ff08a2a52
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc3
References: git-fixes

Under heavy loads where the kyber I/O scheduler hits the token limits for
its scheduling domains, kyber can become stuck.  When active requests
complete, kyber may not be woken up leaving the I/O requests in kyber
stuck.

This stuck state is due to a race condition with kyber and the sbitmap
functions it uses to run a callback when enough requests have completed.
The running of a sbt_wait callback can race with the attempt to insert the
sbt_wait.  Since sbitmap_del_wait_queue removes the sbt_wait from the list
first then sets the sbq field to NULL, kyber can see the item as not on a
list but the call to sbitmap_add_wait_queue will see sbq as non-NULL. This
results in the sbt_wait being inserted onto the wait list but ws_active
doesn't get incremented.  So the sbitmap queue does not know there is a
waiter on a wait list.

Since sbitmap doesn't think there is a waiter, kyber may never be
informed that there are domain tokens available and the I/O never advances.
With the sbt_wait on a wait list, kyber believes it has an active waiter
so cannot insert a new waiter when reaching the domain's full state.

This race can be fixed by only adding the sbt_wait to the queue if the
sbq field is NULL.  If sbq is not NULL, there is already an action active
which will trigger the re-running of kyber.  Let it run and add the
sbt_wait to the wait list if still needing to wait.
