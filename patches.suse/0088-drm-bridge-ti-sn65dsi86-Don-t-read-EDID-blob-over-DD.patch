Subject: drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: Don't read EDID blob over DDC
Git-commit: a70e558c151043ce46a5e5999f4310e0b3551f57
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

This is really just a revert of commit 58074b08c04a ("drm/bridge:
ti-sn65dsi86: Read EDID blob over DDC"), resolving conflicts.

The old code failed to read the EDID properly in a very important
case: before the bridge's pre_enable() was called. The way things need
to work:
1. Read the EDID.
2. Based on the EDID, decide on video settings and pixel clock.
3. Enable the bridge w/ the desired settings.

The way things were working:
1. Try to read the EDID but fail; fall back to hardcoded values.
2. Based on hardcoded values, decide on video settings and pixel clock.
3. Enable the bridge w/ the desired settings.
4. Try again to read the EDID, it works now!
5. Realize that the hardcoded settings weren't quite right.
6. Disable / reenable the bridge w/ the right settings.

The reasons for the failures were twofold:
a) Since we never ran the bridge chip's pre-enable then we never set
   the bit to ignore HPD. This meant the bridge chip didn't even _try_
   to go out on the bus and communicate with the panel.
b) Even if we fixed things to ignore HPD, the EDID still wouldn't read
   if the panel wasn't on.

Instead of reverting the code, we could fix it to set the HPD bit and
also power on the panel. However, it also works nicely to just let the
panel code read the EDID. Now that we've split the driver up we can
expose the DDC AUX channel bus to the panel node. The panel can take
charge of reading the EDID.

NOTE: in order for things to work, anyone that needs to read the EDID
will need to instantiate their panel using the new DP AUX bus (AKA by
listing their panel under the "aux-bus" node of the bridge chip in the
device tree).

In the future if we want to use the bridge chip to provide a full
external DP port (which won't have a panel) then we will have to
conditinally add EDID reading back in.
