+Interaction between KDB and LKCD.
+
+Executive summary: Do not select CONFIG_KDB_CONTINUE_CATASTROPHIC=2 or
+use KDB command 'sr c' without first patching LKCD to use KDB data.
+
+Both KDB and LKCD try to stop all the other cpus, so the system is not
+changing while it is being debugged or dumped.  KDB will cope with cpus
+that cannot be stopped, some versions of LKCD will just hang.  In
+particular, when LKCD is invoked from KDB, LKCD will attempt to stop
+the other cpus again and may hang.
+
+Some versions of LKCD detect that other cpus are not responding and
+ignore them.  This is almost as bad, the data is changing while it is
+being dumped.  Also the method used to avoid hung cpus has been known
+to cause oops when LKCD has finished dumping.
+
+LKCD does not know about several special cases on IA64, including INIT
+and MCA backtraces, interrupt handlers, out of line code etc.  LKCD
+cannot capture cpu state on any cpu that is not responding to OS
+interrupts, which means that any cpu that is spinning in a disabled
+loop cannot be debugged.  Any cpu that calls into SAL for MCA
+rendezvous cannot be debugged.  Even when LKCD captures IA64 state, the
+user space lcrash code cannot unwind through any assembler code, which
+rules out all the interesting cases.
+
+KDB knows far more than LKCD about architecture peculiarities, stack
+formats, interrupt handling etc.  The methods used by KDB to stop the
+other processors and capture their state are far more reliable than
+those used by LKCD.  KDB can capture INIT and MCA data on IA64, as well
+as save the state of cpus before they enter SAL.
+
+Rather than duplicating the complex KDB code in LKCD, LKCD can be
+patched to use the information that has already been captured by KDB.
+Obviously this only works when LKCD is invoked from KDB.  If you invoke
+LKCD directly from the console with SysRq-c or the dump() function is
+called from code outside KDB then you get the old and broken LKCD
+processing.  Because lcrash uses the old unwind algorithm which cannot
+unwind through IA64 assembler code, KDB kludges the saved state into
+something that the old unwind algorithm can cope with.  Calling LKCD
+from KDB gives you a clean dump, but you have to patch LKCD first.
+
+There are two ways to invoke LKCD from KDB.  One way is manual, using
+the KDB 'sr c' command.  This is identical to doing SysRq-C from the
+console except that it goes through KDB first, so LKCD can use the data
+that KDB has captured.  Obviously 'sr c' requires human intervention
+and KDB must be on, it is up to the person doing the debugging if they
+want to take a dump.
+
+The second way is to set CONFIG_KDB_CONTINUE_CATASTROPHIC=2.  With this
+setting, you automatically get a dump for catastrophic errors.  A
+catastrophic error is a panic, oops, NMI or other watchdog tripping,
+INIT and MCA events on IA64.  CONFIG_KDB_CONTINUE_CATASTROPHIC=2 has no
+effect on debugging events such as break points, single step etc. so it
+does not interfere with manual debugging.
+
+When CONFIG_KDB_CONTINUE_CATASTROPHIC=2 and KDB is on, a catastrophic
+error will drop into KDB to allow manual debugging, typing 'go' will
+take a dump and force a reboot.  With this setting and KDB is off, KDB
+detects a catastrophic error, does enough processing to capture the
+state, takes a dump and forces a reboot - all automatic with no human
+intervention.
+
+For unattended and clean LKCD dumps, patch LKCD to use KDB data.  Use
+  CONFIG_DUMP=y
+  CONFIG_KDB=y
+  CONFIG_KDB_OFF=y
+  CONFIG_KDB_CONTINUE_CATASTROPHIC=2
+
+If you want human intervention before taking a dump, use
+  CONFIG_DUMP=y
+  CONFIG_KDB=y
+  CONFIG_KDB_OFF=n
+  CONFIG_KDB_CONTINUE_CATASTROPHIC=2
+
+
+The following are indicative patches against lkcd 4.1, kernel 2.4.20.
+You may have to to modify the patches for other kernels or other
+versions of lkcd.

+.SH NAME
+Built-in Kernel Debugger for Linux - v4.4
+.SH "Overview"
+This document describes the built-in kernel debugger available
+for linux.   This debugger allows the programmer to interactively
+examine kernel memory, disassemble kernel functions, set breakpoints
+in the kernel code and display and modify register contents.
+.P
+A symbol table is included in the kernel image and in modules which
+enables all non-stack symbols (including static symbols) to be used as
+arguments to the kernel debugger commands.
+.SH "Getting Started"
+To include the kernel debugger in a linux kernel, use a
+configuration mechanism (e.g. xconfig, menuconfig, et. al.)
+to enable the \fBCONFIG_KDB\fP option.   Additionally, for accurate
+stack tracebacks, it is recommended that the \fBCONFIG_FRAME_POINTER\fP
+option be enabled (if present).   \fBCONFIG_FRAME_POINTER\fP changes the compiler
+flags so that the frame pointer register will be used as a frame
+pointer rather than a general purpose register.
+.P
+After linux has been configured to include the kernel debugger,
+make a new kernel with the new configuration file (a make clean
+is recommended before making the kernel), and install the kernel
+as normal.
+.P
+You can compile a kernel with kdb support but have kdb off by default,
+select \fBCONFIG_KDB_OFF\fR.  Then the user has to explicitly activate
+kdb by booting with the 'kdb=on' flag or, after /proc is mounted, by
+.nf
+  echo "1" > /proc/sys/kernel/kdb
+.fi
+You can also do the reverse, compile a kernel with kdb on and
+deactivate kdb with the boot flag 'kdb=off' or, after /proc is mounted,
+by
+.nf
+  echo "0" > /proc/sys/kernel/kdb
+.fi
+.P
+When booting the new kernel, the 'kdb=early' flag
+may be added after the image name on the boot line to
+force the kernel to stop in the kernel debugger early in the
+kernel initialization process.  'kdb=early' implies 'kdb=on'.
+If the 'kdb=early' flag isn't provided, then kdb will automatically be
+invoked upon system panic or when the \fBPAUSE\fP key is used from the
+keyboard, assuming that kdb is on.  Older versions of kdb used just a
+boot flag of 'kdb' to activate kdb early, this is no longer supported.
+.P
+KDB can also be used via the serial port.  Set up the system to
+have a serial console (see \fIDocumentation/serial-console.txt\fP), you
+must also have a user space program such as agetty set up to read from
+the serial console.
+The control sequence \fB<esc>KDB\fP on the serial port will cause the
+kernel debugger to be entered, assuming that kdb is on, that some
+program is reading from the serial console, at least one cpu is
+accepting interrupts and the serial console driver is still usable.
+.P
+\fBNote:\fR\ When the serial console sequence consists of multiple
+characters such as <esc>KDB then all but the last character are passed
+through to the application that is reading from the serial console.
+After exiting from kdb, you should use backspace to delete the rest of
+the control sequence.
+.P
+If the console is sitting on the login prompt when you enter kdb, then
+the login command may switch into upper case mode.
+This is not a kdb bug, it is a "feature" of login - if the userid is
+all upper case then login assumes that you using a TeleType (circa
+1960) which does not have lower case characters.
+Wait 60 seconds for login to timeout and it will switch back to lower
+case mode.
+.P
+\fBNote:\fR\ Your distributor may have chosen a different kdb
+activation sequence for the serial console.
+Consult your distribution documentation.
+.P
+If you have both a keyboard+video and a serial console, you can use
+either for kdb.
+Define both video and serial consoles with boot parameters
+.P
+.nf
+  console=tty0 console=ttyS0,38400
+.fi
+.P
+Any kdb data entered on the keyboard or the serial console will be echoed
+to both.
+.P
+If you are using a USB keyboard then kdb commands cannot be entered
+until the kernel has initialised the USB subsystem and recognised the
+keyboard.
+Using kdb=early with a USB keyboard will not work, the USB subsystem is
+initialised too late.
+.P
+While kdb is active, the keyboard (not serial console) indicators may strobe.
+The caps lock and scroll lock lights will turn on and off, num lock is not used
+because it can confuse laptop keyboards where the numeric keypad is mapped over
+the normal keys.
+On exit from kdb the keyboard indicators will probably be wrong, they will not match the kernel state.
+Pressing caps lock twice should get the indicators back in sync with
+the kernel.
+.SH "Basic Commands"
+There are several categories of commands available to the
+kernel debugger user including commands providing memory
+display and modification, register display and modification,
+instruction disassemble, breakpoints and stack tracebacks.
+Any command can be prefixed with '-' which will cause kdb to ignore any
+errors on that command, this is useful when packaging commands using
+defcmd.
+A line whose first non-space character is '#' is printed and ignored.
+.P
+The following table shows the currently implemented standard commands,
+these are always available.  Other commands can be added by extra
+debugging modules, type '?' at the kdb prompt to get a list of all
+available commands.

+\fIminlen\fP being the minimum length to which the command can be
+abbreviated (for example, the \fBgo\fP command can be abbreviated
+legally to \fBg\fP).
+.P
+If an input string does not match a command in the command table,
+it is treated as an address expression and the corresponding address
+value and nearest symbol are shown.
+.P
+Some of the commands are described here.
+Information on the more complicated commands can be found in the
+appropriate manual pages.
+.TP 8
+cpu
+With no parameters, it lists the available cpus.
+\&'*' after a cpu number indicates a cpu that did not respond to the kdb
+stop signal.
+\&'+' after a cpu number indicates a cpu for which kdb has some data, but
+that cpu is no longer responding to kdb, so you cannot switch to it.
+This could be a cpu that has failed after entering kdb, or the cpu may
+have saved its state for debugging then entered the prom, this is
+normal for an IA64 MCA event.
+\&'I' after a cpu number means that the cpu was idle before it entered
+kdb, it is unlikely to contain any useful data.
+\&'F' after a cpu number means that the cpu is offline.
+There is currenly no way to distinguish between cpus that used to be
+online but are now offline and cpus that were never online, the kernel
+does not maintain the information required to separate those two cases.
+.I cpu
+followed by a number will switch to that cpu, you cannot switch to
+a cpu marked '*', '+' or 'F'.
+This command is only available if the kernel was configured for SMP.
+.TP 8
+dmesg [lines] [adjust]
+Displays the system messages from the kernel buffer.
+If kdb logging is on, it is disabled by dmesg and is left as disabled.
+With no parameters or a zero value for 'lines', dmesg dumps the entire
+kernel buffer.
+If lines is specified and is positive, dmesg dumps the last 'lines'
+from the buffer.
+If lines is specified and is negative, dmesg dumps the first 'lines'
+from the buffer.
+If adjust is specified, adjust the starting point for the lines that
+are printed.
+When 'lines' is positive, move the starting point back by 'adjust'
+lines, when 'lines' is negative, move the starting point forward by
+\&'adjust' lines.
+.I dmesg -100
+will dump 100 lines, from the start of the buffer.
+.I dmesg 100
+will dump 100 lines, starting 100 lines from the end of the buffer,
+.I dmesg 100 100
+will dump 100 lines, starting 200 lines from the end of the buffer.
+.I dmesg -100 100
+will dump 100 lines, starting 100 lines from the start of the buffer.
+.TP 8
+defcmd
+Defines a new command as a set of other commands, all input until
+.I endefcmd
+is saved and executed as a package.
+.I defcmd
+takes three parameters, the command name to be defined and used to
+invoke the package, a quoted string containing the usage text and a
+quoted string containing the help text for the command.
+When using defcmd, it is a good idea to prefix commands that might fail
+with '-', this ignores errors so the following commands are still
+executed.
+For example,
+.P
+.nf
+        defcmd diag "" "Standard diagnostics"
+          set LINES 2000
+          set BTAPROMPT 0
+          -id %eip-0x40
+          -cpu
+          -ps
+          -dmesg 80
+          -bt
+          -bta
+        endefcmd
+.fi
+.P
+When used with no parameters, defcmd prints all the defined commands.
+.TP 8
+go
+Continue normal execution.
+Active breakpoints are reestablished and the processor(s) allowed to
+run normally.
+To continue at a specific address, use
+.I rm
+to change the instruction pointer then go.
+.TP 8
+id
+Disassemble instructions starting at an address.
+Environment variable IDCOUNT controls how many lines of disassembly
+output the command produces.
+.TP 8
+kill
+Internal command to send a signal (like kill(1)) to a process.
+kill -signal pid.
+.TP 8
+lsmod
+Internal command to list modules.
+This does not use any kernel nor user space services so can be used at any time.
+.TP 8
+per_cpu <variable_name> [<length>] [<cpu>]
+Display the values of a per_cpu variable, the variable_name is
+specified without the \fIper_cpu__\fR prefix.
+Length is the length of the variable, 1-8, if omitted or 0 it defaults
+to the size of the machine's register.
+To display the variable on a specific cpu, the third parameter is the
+cpu number.
+When the third parameter is omitted, the variable's value is printed
+from all cpus, except that zero values are suppressed.
+For each cpu, per_cpu prints the cpu number, the address of the
+variable and its value.
+.TP 8
+pid <number>
+Change the current process context, with no parameters it displays the
+current process.
+The current process is used to display registers, both kernel and user
+space.
+It is also used when dumping user pages.
+.TP 8
+reboot
+Reboot the system, with no attempt to do a clean close down.
+.TP 8
+stackdepth <percentage>
+Print the stack usage for processes using more than the specified
+percentage of their stack.
+If percentage is not supplied, it defaults to 60.
+This command is only implemented on i386 and ia64 architectures,
+patches for other architectures will be gratefully accepted.
+.TP 8
+summary
+Print a summary of the system, including the time (no timezone is
+applied), uname information and various critical system counters.
+.SH INITIAL KDB COMMANDS
+kdb/kdb_cmds is a plain text file where you can define kdb commands
+which are to be issued during kdb_init().  One command per line, blank
+lines are ignored, lines starting with '#' are ignored.  kdb_cmds is
+intended for per user customization of kdb, you can use it to set
+environment variables to suit your hardware or to set standard
+breakpoints for the problem you are debugging.  This file is converted
+to a small C object, compiled and linked into the kernel.  You must
+rebuild and reinstall the kernel after changing kdb_cmds.  This file
+will never be shipped with any useful data so you can always override
+it with your local copy.  Sample kdb_cmds:
+.P
+.nf
+# Initial commands for kdb, alter to suit your needs.
+# These commands are executed in kdb_init() context, no SMP, no
+# processes.  Commands that require process data (including stack or
+# registers) are not reliable this early.  set and bp commands should
+# be safe.  Global breakpoint commands affect each cpu as it is booted.
+
+set LINES=50
+set MDCOUNT=25
+set RECURSE=1
+bp sys_init_module
+.fi
+.SH INTERRUPTS AND KDB
+When a kdb event occurs, one cpu (the initial cpu) enters kdb state.
+It uses a cross system interrupt to interrupt the
+other cpus and bring them all into kdb state.  All cpus run with
+interrupts disabled while they are inside kdb, this prevents most
+external events from disturbing the kernel while kdb is running.
+.B Note:
+Disabled interrupts means that any I/O that relies on interrupts cannot
+proceed while kdb is in control, devices can time out.  The clock tick
+is also disabled, machines will lose track of time while they are
+inside kdb.
+.P
+Even with interrupts disabled, some non-maskable interrupt events will
+still occur, these can disturb the kernel while you are debugging it.
+The initial cpu will still accept NMI events, assuming that kdb was not
+entered for an NMI event.  Any cpu where you use the SS or SSB commands
+will accept NMI events, even after the instruction has finished and the
+cpu is back in kdb.  This is an unavoidable side effect of the fact that
+doing SS[B] requires the cpu to drop all the way out of kdb, including
+exiting from the event that brought the cpu into kdb.  Under normal
+circumstances the only NMI event is for the NMI oopser and that is kdb
+aware so it does not disturb the kernel while kdb is running.
+.P
+Sometimes doing SS or SSB on ix86 will allow one interrupt to proceed,
+even though the cpu is disabled for interrupts.  I have not been able
+to track this one down but I suspect that the interrupt was pending
+when kdb was entered and it runs when kdb exits through IRET even
+though the popped flags are marked as cli().  If any ix86 hardware
+expert can shed some light on this problem, please notify the kdb
+maintainer.
+.SH RECOVERING FROM KDB ERRORS
+If a kdb command breaks and kdb has enough of a recovery environment
+then kdb will abort the command and drop back into mainline kdb code.
+This means that user written kdb commands can follow bad pointers
+without killing kdb.  Ideally all code should verify that data areas
+are valid (using kdb_getarea) before accessing it but lots of calls to
+kdb_getarea can be clumsy.
+.P
+The sparc64 port does not currently provide this error recovery.
+If someone would volunteer to write the necessary longjmp/setjmp
+code, their efforts would be greatly appreciated. In the
+meantime, it is possible for kdb to trigger a panic by accessing
+a bad address.
+.SH DEBUGGING THE DEBUGGER
+kdb has limited support for debugging problems within kdb.  If you
+suspect that kdb is failing, you can set environment variable KDBDEBUG
+to a bit pattern which will activate kdb_printf statements within kdb.
+See include/linux/kdb.h, KDB_DEBUG_FLAG_xxx defines.  For example
+.nf
+  set KDBDEBUG=0x60
+.fi
+activates the event callbacks into kdb plus state tracing in sections
+of kdb.
+.nf
+  set KDBDEBUG=0x18
+.fi
+gives lots of tracing as kdb tries to decode the process stack.
+.P
+You can also perform one level of recursion in kdb.  If environment
+variable RECURSE is not set or is 0 then kdb will either recover from
+an error (if the recovery environment is satisfactory) or kdb will
+allow the error to percolate, usually resulting in a dead system.  When
+RECURSE is 1 then kdb will recover from an error or, if there is no
+satisfactory recovery environment, it will drop into kdb state to let
+you diagnose the problem.  When RECURSE is 2 then all errors drop into
+kdb state, kdb does not attempt recovery first.  Errors while in
+recursive state all drop through, kdb does not even attempt to recover
+from recursive errors.
+.SH KEYBOARD EDITING
+kdb supports a command history, which can be accessed via keyboard
+sequences.
+It supports the special keys on PC keyboards, control characters and
+vt100 sequences on a serial console or a PC keyboard.
+.P
+.DS
+.TS
+box, center;
+l | l | l l | l
+l | l | l l | l.
+PC Special keys	Control	VT100 key	Codes	Action

+Left arrow	ctrl-B	Left arrow	\\e[D	Left one character in current command
+Right arrow	ctrl-F	Right arrow	\\e[C	Right one character in current command
+.TE
+.DE
+.P
+There is no toggle for insert/replace mode, kdb editing is always in
+insert mode.
+Use delete and backspace to delete characters.
+.P
+kdb also supports tab completion for kernel symbols
+Type the start of a kernel symbol and press tab (ctrl-I) to complete
+the name
+If there is more than one possible match, kdb will append any common
+characters and wait for more input, pressing tab a second time will
+display the possible matches
+The number of matches is limited by environment variable DTABCOUNT,
+with a default of 30 if that variable is not set.

+.TH BD 1 "July 12, 2004"
+.SH NAME
+bp, bpa, bph, bpha, bd, bc, be, bl \- breakpoint commands
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+bp \fIaddress-expression\fP
+.LP
+bpa \fIaddress-expression\fP
+.LP
+bph \fIaddress-expression\fP [\f(CWDATAR|DATAW|DATAA|IO\fP [\fIlength\fP]]
+.LP
+bpha \fIaddress-expression\fP [\f(CWDATAR|DATAW|DATAA|IO\fP [\fIlength\fP]]
+.LP

+.LP
+bc \fIbreakpoint-number\fP
+.LP
+be \fIbreakpoint-number\fP
+.LP
+bl
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.hy 0
+The
+.B bp
+family of commands are used to establish a breakpoint.
+The \fIaddress-expression\fP may be a numeric value (decimal or
+hexidecimal), a symbol name, a register name preceeded by a
+percent symbol '%', or a simple expression consisting of a
+symbol name, an addition or subtraction character and a numeric
+value (decimal or hexidecimal).
+.P
+\fBbph\fP and \fBbpha\fP will force the use of a hardware register, provided
+the processor architecture supports them.
+.P
+The \fIaddress-expression\fP may also consist of a single
+asterisk '*' symbol which indicates that the command should
+operate on all existing breakpoints (valid only for \fBbc\fP,
+\fBbd\fP and \fBbe\fP).
+.P
+Four different types of
+breakpoints may be set:
+
+.TP 8
+Instruction
+Causes the kernel debugger to be invoked from the debug exception
+path when an instruction is fetched from the specified address.  This
+is the default if no other type of breakpoint is requested or when
+the \fBbp\fP command is used.
+
+.TP 8
+DATAR
+Causes the kernel debugger to be entered when data of length
+\fIlength\fP is read from or written to the specified address.
+This type of breakpoint must use a processor debug register which
+places an architecture dependent limit on the number of data and I/O
+breakpoints that may be established. On arm mode XScale platform
+(thumb mode is not supported yet),
+debugger is triggered by reading from the specified address.
+The \fBbph\fP or \fBbpha\fP commands must be used.
+
+.TP 8
+DATAW
+Enters the kernel debugger when data of length \fIlength\fP
+is written to the specified address.  \fIlength\fP defaults
+to four bytes if it is not explicitly specified.
+Note that the processor may have already overwritten the prior data at
+the breakpoint location before the kernel debugger is invoked.
+The prior data should be saved before establishing the breakpoint, if
+required. On arm mode XScale platform, the debugger is triggered
+after having overwritten the specified address.
+The \fBbph\fP or \fBbpha\fP commands must be used.
+
+.TP 8
+IO
+Enters the kernel debugger when an \fBin\fP or \fBout\fP instruction
+targets the specified I/O address.  The \fBbph\fP or \fBbpha\fP
+commands must be used. This type of breakpoint is not valid in
+arm mode XScale platform. This option is not valid in arm
+mode XScale platform.
+
+.TP 8
+DATAA
+Enters the kernel debugger after the data in specified address has
+been accessed (read or write), this option is only used in arm
+mode XScale platform.
+
+.P
+The
+.B bpha
+command will establish a breakpoint on all processors in an
+SMP system.   This command is not available in an uniprocessor
+kernel.
+.P
+The
+.B bd
+command will disable a breakpoint without removing it from the kernel
+debugger's breakpoint table.
+This can be used to keep breakpoints in the table without exceeding the
+architecture limit on breakpoint registers.
+A breakpoint-number of \fI*\fR will disable all break points.
+.P
+The
+.B be
+command will re-enable a disabled breakpoint.
+A breakpoint-number of \fI*\fR will enable all break points.
+.P
+The
+.B bc
+command will clear a breakpoint from the breakpoint table.
+A breakpoint-number of \fI*\fR will clear all break points.
+.P
+The
+.B bl
+command will list the existing set of breakpoints.
+.SH LIMITATIONS
+There is a compile time limit of sixteen entries in the
+breakpoint table at any one time.
+.P
+There are architecture dependent limits on the number of hardware
+breakpoints that can be set.
+.IP ix86 8
+Four.
+.PD 0
+.IP xscale 8
+Two for insruction breakpoints and another two for data breakpoint.
+.PD 0
+.IP ia64 8
+?
+.PD 0
+.IP sparc64 8
+None.
+.PD 1
+When issuing the "go" command after entering the debugger due to
+a breakpoint, kdb will silently perform a single step in order to
+reapply the breakpoint. The sparc64 port has some limitations on
+single stepping, which may limit where a breakpoint may be safely
+set. Please read the man page for \fBss\fP for more information.
+.SH ENVIRONMENT
+The breakpoint subsystem does not currently use any environment
+variables.
+.SH SMP CONSIDERATIONS
+Using
+.B bc
+is risky on SMP systems.
+If you clear a breakpoint when another cpu has hit that breakpoint but
+has not been processed then it may not be recognised as a kdb
+breakpoint, usually resulting in incorrect program counters and kernel
+panics.
+It is safer to disable the breakpoint with
+.BR bd ,
+then
+.B go
+to let any other processors that are waiting on the breakpoint to
+clear.
+After all processors are clear of the disabled breakpoint then it is
+safe to clear it using
+.BR bc .
+.P
+Breakpoints which use the processor breakpoint registers
+are only established on the processor which is
+currently active.  If you wish breakpoints to be universal
+use the
+.B bpa
+or
+.B bpha
+commands.
+.SH EXAMPLES
+.TP 8
+bp schedule
+Sets an instruction breakpoint at the begining of the
+function \fBschedule\fP.
+
+.TP 8
+bp schedule+0x12e
+Sets an instruction breakpoint at the instruction located
+at \fBschedule\fP+\fI0x12e\fP.
+
+.TP 8
+bph ttybuffer+0x24 dataw
+Sets a data write breakpoint at the location referenced by
+\fBttybuffer\fP+\fI0x24\fP for a length of four bytes.
+
+.TP 8
+bph 0xc0254010 datar 1
+Establishes a data reference breakpoint at address \fB0xc0254010\fP
+for a length of one byte.
+
+.TP 8
+bp
+List current breakpoint table.
+
+.TP 8
+bd 0
+Disable breakpoint #0.
+
+.TP 8
+bc *
+Clear all breakpoints

+.TH BT 1 "September 14, 2004"
+.SH NAME
+bt \- Stack Traceback command
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+bt [ <stack-frame-address> ]
+.LP
+btp <pid>
+.LP
+btt <struct-task-address>
+.LP
+bta [ DRSTZUIMA ]
+.LP
+btc [<cpu>]
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.hy 0
+The
+.B bt
+command is used to print a stack traceback.  It uses the
+current registers (see \fBrd\fP command) to determine
+the starting context and attempts to provide a complete
+stack traceback for the active thread.   If \fIstack-frame-address\fP
+is supplied, it is assumed to point to the start of a valid
+stack frame and the stack will be traced back from that
+point (e.g. on i386 architecture, \fIstack-frame-address\fP
+should be the stack address of a saved \fB%eip\fP value from a \fBcall\fP
+instruction. on sparc64 architecture, it should be a pointer to a
+saved register window, as is found in the \fB%fp\fP register).
+.P
+If present, a kernel configuration option \fBCONFIG_FRAME_POINTER\fP
+should be enabled so that the compiler will utilize the frame pointer
+register properly to maintain a stack which can be correctly
+analyzed. Some architectures (e.g. sparc64) always use
+\fBCONFIG_FRAME_POINTER\fP, and so the option is not present.
+.P
+The \fBbt\fP command will attempt to analyze the stack without
+frame pointers if the \fBCONFIG_FRAME_POINTER\fP option is not
+enabled, but the analysis is difficult and may not produce
+accurate nor complete results.
+.P
+The \fBbtp\fP command will analyze the stack for the given
+process identification (see the \fBps\fP command).
+.P
+The \fBbtt\fP command will analyze the stack for the given task
+structure.
+It is exactly equivalent to \fBbtp\fR on the pid extracted from the
+task structure.
+.P
+The \fBbta\fP command lists the stack for all processes in the desired
+state.
+Without any parameters, \fBbta\fP gives a backtrace for all useful processes.
+If a parameter is specified, it is a single string consisting of the
+letters D, R, S, T, Z, U, I, M and A in any order.
+See the kdb \fBps\fR man page for more details.
+.P
+The \fBbtc\fP command will analyze the stack for the current process on
+a specified cpu or, if no cpu number is supplied, for the current
+process on all cpus.
+It does not switch to the other cpus, instead it uses the task
+structures to identify and issue \fBbtt\fR against the current task on
+the desired cpus.
+.P
+For each function, the stack trace prints at least two lines.
+The first line contains four or five fields\ :-
+.IP * 3
+The pointer to the previous stack frame, blank if there is no valid
+frame pointer.
+.PD 0
+.IP * 3
+The current address within this frame.
+.IP * 3
+The address converted to a function name (actually the first non-local
+label which is <= the address).
+.IP * 3
+The offset of the address within the function.
+.IP * 3
+Any parameters to the function.
+.PD 1
+.PP
+On the next line there are five fields which are designed to make it
+easier to match the trace against the kernel code\ :-
+.IP * 3
+The module name that contains the address, "kernel" if it is in the
+base kernel.
+.PD 0
+.IP * 3
+The section name that contains the address (not available on 2.6 kernels).
+.IP * 3
+The start address of the section (not available on 2.6 kernels).
+.IP * 3
+The start address of the function.
+.IP * 3
+The end address of the function (the first non-local label which is >
+the address).
+.PD 1
+.PP
+If arguments are being converted to symbols, any argument which
+converts to a kernel or module address is printed as\ :-
+.IP * 3
+Argument address.
+.PD 0
+.IP * 3
+The module name that contains the address, "kernel" if it is in the
+base kernel.
+.IP * 3
+The symbol name the argument maps to.
+.IP * 3
+The offset of the argument from the symbol, suppressed if 0.
+.PD 1
+.SH MATCHING TRACE TO KERNEL CODE
+The command "objdump\ -S" will disassemble an object and, if the code
+was compiled with debugging (gcc flag -g), objdump will interleave the
+C source lines with the generated object.
+.PP
+A complete objdump of the kernel or a module is too big, normally you
+only want specific functions.
+By default objdump will only print the .text section but Linux uses
+other section names for executable code.
+When objdump prints relocatable objects (modules) it uses an offset of
+0 which is awkward to relate to the stack trace.
+The five fields which are printed for each function are designed to
+make it easier to match the stack trace against the kernel code using
+"objdump\ -S".
+.PP
+If the function is in the kernel then you need the section name, the
+start and end address of the function.  The command is
+.PP
+.nf
+  objdump -S -j <section_name> \\
+          --start-address=<start-address> \\
+          --stop-address=<end-address> \\
+          /usr/src/linux/vmlinux
+.fi
+.PP
+If the function is in a module then you need the section name, the
+start address of the section, the start and end address of the
+function, the module name.  The command is
+.PP
+.nf
+  objdump -S -j <section_name> \\
+          --adjust-vma=<section-start> \\
+          --start-address=<start-address> \\
+          --stop-address=<end-address> \\
+          /path/to/module/<module-name>.o
+.fi
+.PP
+Unfortunately the 2.6 kernel does not provide the information required
+to locate the start of the section, which makes it very difficult to
+perform a reliable objdump on a module.
+.PP
+All addresses to objdump must be preceded by '0x' if they are in hex,
+objdump does not assume hex.
+The stack trace values are printed with leading '0x' to make it easy to
+run objdump.
+.SH LIMITATIONS
+If the kernel is compiled without frame pointers, stack tracebacks
+may be incomplete.  The \fBmds %esp\fP (i386) or \fBmds %fp\fP (sparc64)
+command may be useful in attemping to determine the actual stack
+traceback manually.
+.P
+A stack trace can be misleading if any code in a function exit has been
+executed, the stack is partially unwound at that stage.
+.P
+The \fBbt\fP command may print more arguments for a function
+than that function accepts;  For sparc64, this will always happen
+as the debugger cannot determine the correct number. For i386, this happens
+when the C compiler doesn't immediately pop the arguments off the stack upon
+return from a called function.  When this is this case, these extra
+stack words will be considered additional arguments by the \fBbt\fP
+command.
+.SH ENVIRONMENT
+The \fBBTARGS\fP environment variable governs the maximum number
+of arguments that are printed for any single function.
+.PP
+If the \fBBTSYMARG\fP environment variable is non-zero then any
+arguments that fall within the kernel are converted to symbols.
+.PP
+If the \fBNOSECT\fP environment variable is non-zero then the
+section information is suppressed.
+The default is NOSECT=1 so section data is suppressed; use set\ NOSECT=0
+to see section information.
+.PP

+.TH ENV 1 "24 September 2000"
+.SH NAME
+env, set \- Environment manipulation commands
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+env
+.LP
+set \fIenvironment-variable\fP=\fIvalue\fP
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+The kernel debugger contains an environment which contains a series
+of name-value pairs.  Some environment variables are known to the
+various kernel debugger commands and have specific meaning to the
+command; such are enumerated on the respective reference material.
+.P
+Arbitrary environment variables may be created and used with
+many commands (those which require an \fIaddress-expression\fP).
+.P
+The
+.B env
+command is used to display the current environment.
+.P
+The
+.B set
+command is used to alter an existing environment variable or
+establish a new environment variable.
+.SH LIMITATIONS
+There is a compile-time limit of 33 environment variables.
+.P
+There is a compile-time limit of 512 bytes (\fBKDB_ENVBUFSIZE\fP)
+of heap space available for new environment variables and for
+environment variables changed from their compile-time values.
+.SH ENVIRONMENT
+These commands explicitly manipulate the environment.
+.SH SMP CONSIDERATIONS
+None.
+.SH USER SETTINGS
+You can include "set" commands in kdb/kdb_cmds (see kdb.mm) to define
+your environment variables at kernel startup.
+.SH EXAMPLES
+.TP 8
+env
+Display current environment settings.
+
+.TP 8
+set IDCOUNT=100
+Set the number of lines to display for the \fBid\fP command
+to the value \fI100\fP.

+.SH NAME

+.SH SYNOPSIS
+md [ \fIaddress-expression\fP [ \fIline-count\fP [\fIoutput-radix\fP ] ] ]
+.LP
+md\fIW\fRc\fIn\fR [ \fIaddress-expression\fP [ \fIline-count\fP [\fIoutput-radix\fP ] ] ]

+.LP
+mm \fIaddress-expression\fP \fInew-contents\fP
+.LP
+mm\fIW\fR \fIaddress-expression\fP \fInew-contents\fP
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+The
+.B md 
+command is used to display the contents of memory.
+The \fIaddress-expression\fP may be a numeric value (decimal or
+hexidecimal), a symbol name, a register name preceeded by one or more
+percent symbols '%', an environment variable name preceeded by
+a currency symbol '$',  or a simple expression consisting of a 
+symbol name, an addition or subtraction character and a numeric
+value (decimal or hexidecimal).
+.P
+If an address is specified and the \fIline-count\fP or \fIradix\fP arguments
+are omitted, they default to the values of the \fBMDCOUNT\fP and \fBRADIX\fP
+environment variables respectively.  If the \fBMDCOUNT\fP or \fBRADIX\fP
+environment variables are unset, the appropriate defaults will be used [see
+\fBENVIRONMENT\fP below].  If no address is specified then md resumes
+after the last address printed, using the previous values of count and
+radix.  The start address is rounded down to a multiple of the
+BYTESPERWORD (md) or width (md\fIW\fR).
+.P
+md uses the current value of environment variable \fBBYTESPERWORD\fP to
+read the data.  When reading hardware registers that require special
+widths, it is more convenient to use md\fIW\fRc\fIn\fR where \fIW\fR is
+the width for this command and \fRc\fIn\fR is the number of entries to
+read.  For example, md1c20 reads 20 bytes, 1 at a time.  To continue
+printing just type md, the width and count apply to following md
+commands with no parameters.  \fBNote:\fR The count is the number of
+repeats of the width, unlike MDCOUNT which gives the number of md lines
+to print.
+.P
+The
+.B mdp
+command displays the contents of physical memory, starting at the
+specified physical address for the specified number of bytes.
+The address is preceded by 'phys'.
+.P
+The
+.B mdr
+command displays the raw contents of memory, starting at the specified
+address for the specified number of bytes.
+The data is printed in one line without a leading address and no
+trailing character conversion.
+.B mdr
+is intended for interfacing with external debuggers, it is of little
+use to humans.
+.P
+The
+.B mds
+command displays the contents of memory one word per line and
+attempts to correlate the contents of each word with a symbol
+in the symbol table.   If no symbol is found, the ascii representation
+of the word is printed, otherwise the symbol name and offset from
+symbol value are printed.
+By default the section data is printed for kernel symbols.
+.P
+The
+.B mm
+and
+\fBmm\fIW\fR
+commands allow modification of memory.   The bytes at the address
+represented by \fIaddress-expression\fP are changed to 
+\fInew-contents\fP.  \fInew-contents\fP is allowed to be an
+\fIaddress-expression\fP.
+.B mm
+changes a machine word, \fBmm\fIW\fR changes \fIW\fR bytes at that
+address.
+.SH LIMITATIONS
+None.
+.SH ENVIRONMENT
+.TP 8
+MDCOUNT
+This environment variable (default=8) defines the number of lines
+that will be displayed by each invocation of the \fBmd\fP command.
+
+.TP 8
+RADIX
+This environment variable (default=16) defines the radix used to
+print the memory contents.  
+
+.TP 8
+BYTESPERWORD
+This environment variable (default=4) selects the width of output
+data when printing memory contents.  Select the value two to get
+16-bit word output, select the value one to get byte output.
+
+.TP 8
+LINES
+This environment variable governs the number of lines of output 
+that will be presented before the kernel debugger built-in pager
+pauses the output.   This variable only affects the functioning
+of the \fBmd\fP and \fBmds\fP if the \fBMDCOUNT\fP variable 
+is set to a value greater than the \fBLINES\fP variable.
+
+.TP 8
+NOSECT
+If the \fBNOSECT\fP environment variable is non-zero then the
+section information is suppressed.
+The default is NOSECT=1 so section data is suppressed; use set\ NOSECT=0
+to see section information.
+.SH SMP CONSIDERATIONS
+None.
+.SH EXAMPLES
+.TP 8
+md %edx
+Display memory starting at the address contained in register \fB%edx\fP.
+
+.TP 8
+mds %esp
+Display stack contents symbolically.   This command is quite useful
+in manual stack traceback.
+
+.TP 8
+mm 0xc0252110 0x25
+Change the memory location at 0xc0252110 to the value 0x25.
+
+.TP 8
+md chrdev_table 15
+Display 15 lines (at 16 bytes per line) starting at address 
+represented by the symbol \fIchrdev_table\fP.

+.TH PS 1 "September 14, 2004"
+.SH NAME
+ps \- Display processes
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+ps [ DRSTCZEUIMA ]
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+The
+.B ps
+command displays the status of all processes in the desired state.
+This command does not take any locks (all cpus should be frozen while
+kdb is running) so it can safely be used to debug lock problems with
+the process table.
+.P
+Without any parameters, \fBps\fP displays all the interesting
+processes, excluding idle tasks and sleeping system daemons.
+If a parameter is specified, it is a single string consisting of the
+letters D, R, S, T, C, Z, E, U, I and M, in any order.
+Each letter selects processes in a specific state, when multiple
+letters are specified, a process will be displayed if it is in any of
+the specified states.
+The states are\ :-
+.P
+.DS
+.TS
+box, center;
+l | l
+l | l.
+D	Uninterruptible sleep
+R	Running
+S	Interruptible sleep
+T	Stopped
+C	Traced
+Z	Zombie
+E	Dead
+U	Unrunnable
+I	Idle task
+M	Sleeping system daemon
+A	All
+.TE
+.DE
+.P
+For state R (running), the process may not be on a cpu at the moment,
+but it is ready to run.
+The header line above the backtrace contains '1' in the fourth field if
+the process is actually on a cpu.
+.P
+The idle task is run on each cpu when there is no work for that cpu to do.
+Unless the idle task is servicing an interrupt, there is no point in
+printing the idle task.
+An idle task that is not servicing a interrupt is marked as state I,
+while servicing an interrupt it is in state R.
+By default, idle tasks are not printed, use \fBps\ I\fR to print them.
+If the idle tasks are not being printed, the start of the \fBps\R
+output contains a list of which cpus are idle.
+.P
+Each cpu has one or more system daemons to handle per cpu work such as
+soft irqs.
+A system daemon (idenified by a NULL mm pointer) that is sleeping is
+marked as state M.
+These processes rarely have any useful data and generate a lot of
+output on large machines, so sleeping system daemons are not printed by
+default.
+Use \fBps\ M\fR to print them.
+.P
+At the start of the \fBps\fR output is a line giving the cpu status,
+see the kdb \fBcpu\fR command.

+.TH RD 1 "1 June 2003"
+.SH NAME
+rd, rm\- Register manipulation commands
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+rd [[c [n]]|d|u]
+.LP
+rm \fIregister-name\fP \fInew-contents\fP
+.LP
+ef <address>
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+The
+.B rd
+command is used to display the contents of processor and coprocessor registers.
+Without any arguments, the rd command displays the contents of
+the general register set at the point at which the kernel debugger
+was entered. 'n' argumnet is only used for XScale platform to identify
+the want coprocessor number, while 'd' option is not valid for XScale platform.
+.P
+On IA32 and IA64, with the 'c' argument, the processor control registers
+%cr0, %cr1, %cr2 and %cr4 are displayed, while with the 'd' argument
+the processor debug registers are displayed.  If the 'u' argument
+is supplied, the registers for the current task as of the last
+time the current task entered the kernel are displayed.
+.P
+On XScale, 'c' argument is used to display the
+all coprocessor control registers or specified coprocessor registers by
+argumnet 'n'. Argument 'u' is used to display the
+registers for the current task as of the last time the current task
+entered the kernel. Argument 'd' is not supported.
+.P
+On ix86, the
+.B rm
+command allows modification of a register.  The following
+register names are valid:  \fB%eax\fP, \fB%ebx\fP, \fB%ecx\fP,
+\fB%edx\fP, \fB%esi\fP, \fB%edi\fP, \fB%esp\fP, \fB%eip\fP,
+and \fB%ebp\fP.   Note that if two '%' symbols are used
+consecutively, the register set displayed by the 'u' argument
+to the \fBrd\fP command is modified.
+.P
+The debug registers, \fBdr0\fP through \fBdr3\fP and both
+\fBdr6\fP and \fBdr7\fP can also be modified with the \fBrm\fP
+command.
+.P
+On sparc64, the valid registers are named \fB%g0\fP through
+\fB%g7\fP, \fB%l0\fP through \fB%l7\fP, \fB%o0\fP through
+\fB%o7\fP, and \fB%i0\fP through \fB%i7\fP, with the exceptions
+that \fB%o6\fP is called \fB%sp\fP and that \fB%i6\fP is called
+\fB%fp\fP. The registers \fB%tstate\fP, \fB%tpc\fP, \fB%tnpc\fP,
+\fB%y\fP, and \fB%fprs\fP provide state information at the time
+the system entered kdb. Additionally, when viewing registers, two
+convenience names are provided: \fB%&regs\fP shows the
+address on the stack of the current registers, and \fB%csp\fP
+shows the current stack pointer within kdb itself.
+.P
+While on XScale, both the cpu registers and most coprocessor
+registers can be be modified. \fIregister-name\fP can be followings like
+r0, r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6, r7, r8, r9, r10, r11, r12, r13, r14,
+r15, cpsr to address  cpu registers. For the coprocessor registers in XSacle,
+either alias name or \fICpcc[CRndd[CRmbb[Opaa]]]\fP can be used to address
+the register in coprocessor cc with CRn=dd, CRm=bb and opcode2=aa. All aa, bb, cc, dd can be
+1 or 2 decimal digitals, the default value is 0 when any of them is omitted. Name
+acc0_h and acc0_l are used to identify the high byte and
+low word of accumulator in coprocessor 0.
+.P
+The
+.B ef
+command displays an exception frame at the specified address.
+.SH LIMITATIONS
+Currently the \fBrm\fP command will not allow modification of the
+control registers.
+.P
+Currently neither the \fBrd\fP command nor the \fBrm\fP command will
+display or modify the model specific registers on the Pentium
+and Pentium Pro families.
+.SH ENVIRONMENT
+None.
+.SH SMP CONSIDERATIONS
+None.
+.SH EXAMPLES
+.TP 8
+rd
+Display general register set.
+
+.TP 8
+rd c 0
+Display coprocessor 0 registers.
+
+.TP 8
+rm %eax 0
+Set the contents of \fB%eax\fP to zero.  This will be the
+value of %eax when kdb returns from the condition which
+invoked it.
+
+.TP 8
+rm %%eax 0
+Set the value of the \fB%eax\fP register to zero.  This will
+be the value the user-mode application will see upon returning
+from the kernel.
+
+.TP 8
+rm %acc0_h 0
+Set the contents of high byte of accumulator to zero.
+
+.TP 8
+rm dr0 0xc1287220
+Set the value of the \fBdr0\fB register to \f(CW0xc1287220\fP.
+
+.TP 8
+rm %InVLD_BTB 0
+Write 0 to coprocessor 15 register with CRn=7, CRm=5, opcode2=6.
+
+.TP 8
+rm %CP15CRn7CRm5Op6 0
+Same with above.

+.TH SR 1 "7 October 2002"
+.SH NAME
+sr \- invoke sysrq commands from kdb
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+sr \fIx\fP
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.hy 0
+The
+.B sr
+command invokes the existing sysrq handler code in the kernel.
+This command takes a single character which is passed to sysrq
+processing, as if you had entered the sysrq key sequence followed by
+that character.
+.P
+.B Caveats:
+.P
+kdb will always call the sysrq code but sysrq may be disabled.
+If you expect to use sysrq functions during debugging then
+.IP ""
+echo "1" > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
+.P
+before starting the debug session.
+Alternatively issue
+.IP ""
+mm4 sysrq_enabled 1
+.P
+during debugging.
+.P
+The sysrq code prints a heading using console loglevel 7 then reverts
+to the original loglevel for the rest of the sysrq processing.
+If the rest of the sysrq output is printed at a level below your
+current loglevel then you will not see the output on the kdb console,
+the output will only appear in the printk buffer.
+It is the user's responsibility to set the loglevel correctly if they
+want to see the sysrq output on the console.
+Issue
+.IP ""
+sr 7
+.P
+before any other
+.B sr
+commands if you want to see the output on the console.
+You may even have to adjust the default message loglevel in order to
+see any output from
+.BR sr .
+See Documentation/sysctl/kernel.txt for details on setting console
+loglevels via /proc.
+You can also adjust the loglevel variables via kdb
+.BR mm ;
+on older kernels there are variables such as default_message_level, on
+newer kernels all the loglevel variables are in array console_printk,
+see kernel/printk.c for your kernel.
+.P
+Operations that require interrupt driven I/O can be invoked from kdb
+.BR sr ,
+but they will not do anything until you type 'go' to exit from kdb
+(interrupts are disabled while in kdb).
+There is no guarantee that these operations will work, if the machine
+entered kdb because of an error then interrupt driven I/O may already
+be dead.
+Do not assume that
+.B sr\ s
+does anything useful.
+.P
+The sysrq handler uses locks and calls printk which also uses locks.
+If the sysrq handler or any of the sysrq functions have to wait for a
+lock then they will never return and kdb will appear to hang.
+Invoking sysrq code from kdb is inherently unsafe.

+.TH SS 1 "17 January 2002"
+.SH NAME
+ss, ssb \- Single Step
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+ss
+.LP
+ssb
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+The
+.B ss
+command is used to execute a single instruction and return
+to the kernel debugger.
+.P
+Both the instruction that was single-stepped and the next
+instruction to execute are printed.
+.P
+The \fBssb\fP command will execute instructions from the
+current value of the instruction pointer.  Each instruction
+may be printed as it is executed, depending upon architecture;
+execution will stop at any instruction which would cause the flow
+of control to change (e.g. branch, call, interrupt instruction,
+return, etc.)
+.SH LIMITATIONS
+On sparc64, there are some circumstances where single-stepping
+can be dangerous. Do not single-step across an instruction which
+changes the interrupt-enable bit in %tstate. Do not single step
+through code which is invoked when entering or leaving the
+kernel, particularly any kernel entry code before %tl is set to
+0, or any kernel exit code after %tl is set to 1.
+.SH ENVIRONMENT
+None.
+.SH SMP CONSIDERATIONS
+Other processors are held in the kernel debugger when the instruction
+is traced.  Single stepping though code that requires a lock which is
+in use by another processor is an exercise in futility, it will never
+succeed.
+.SH INTERRUPT CONSIDERATIONS
+When a kdb event occurs, one cpu (the initial cpu) enters kdb state.
+It uses a cross system interrupt to interrupt the
+other cpus and bring them all into kdb state.  All cpus run with
+interrupts disabled while they are inside kdb, this prevents most
+external events from disturbing the kernel while kdb is running.
+.B Note:
+Disabled interrupts means that any I/O that relies on interrupts cannot
+proceed while kdb is in control, devices can time out.  The clock tick
+is also disabled, machines will lose track of time while they are
+inside kdb.
+.P
+Even with interrupts disabled, some non-maskable interrupt events
+will still occur, these can disturb the kernel while you are
+debugging it.  The initial cpu will still accept NMI events,
+assuming that kdb was not entered for an NMI event.  Any cpu
+where you use the SS or SSB commands will accept NMI events, even
+after the instruction has finished and the cpu is back in kdb.
+This is an unavoidable side effect of the fact that doing SS[B]
+requires the cpu to drop all the way out of kdb, including
+exiting from the NMI event that brought the cpu into kdb.  Under
+normal circumstances the only NMI event is for the NMI oopser and
+that is kdb aware so it does not disturb the kernel while kdb is
+running.
+.P
+Sometimes doing SS or SSB on ix86 will allow one interrupt to proceed,
+even though the cpu is disabled for interrupts.  I have not been able
+to track this one down but I suspect that the interrupt was pending
+when kdb was entered and it runs when kdb exits through IRET even
+though the popped flags are marked as cli().  If any ix86 hardware
+expert can shed some light on this problem, please notify the kdb
+maintainer.

+ * kdb_read
+ *
+ *	This function reads a string of characters, terminated by
+ *	a newline, or by reaching the end of the supplied buffer,
+ *	from the current kernel debugger console device.
+ * Parameters:
+ *	buffer	- Address of character buffer to receive input characters.
+ *	bufsize - size, in bytes, of the character buffer
+ * Returns:
+ *	Returns a pointer to the buffer containing the received
+ *	character string.  This string will be terminated by a
+ *	newline character.
+ * Locking:
+ *	No locks are required to be held upon entry to this
+ *	function.  It is not reentrant - it relies on the fact
+ *	that while kdb is running on any one processor all other
+ *	processors will be spinning at the kdb barrier.
+ * Remarks:
+ *
+ * Davidm asks, why doesn't kdb use the console abstraction;
+ * here are some reasons:
+ *      - you cannot debug the console abstraction with kdb if
+ *	  kdb uses it.
+ *      - you rely on the correct functioning of the abstraction
+ *	  in the presence of general system failures.
+ *      - You must acquire the console spinlock thus restricting
+ *	  the usability - what if the kernel fails with the spinlock
+ *	  held - one still wishes to debug such situations.
+ *      - How about debugging before the console(s) are registered?
+ *      - None of the current consoles (sercons, vt_console_driver)
+ *	  have read functions defined.
+ *	- The standard pc keyboard and terminal drivers are interrupt
+ *	  driven.   We cannot enable interrupts while kdb is active,
+ *	  so the standard input functions cannot be used by kdb.
+ *
+ * An implementation could be improved by removing the need for
+ * lock acquisition - just keep a 'struct console *kdbconsole;' global
+ * variable which refers to the preferred kdb console.
+ *
+ * The bulk of this function is architecture dependent.
+ *
+ * The buffer size must be >= 2.  A buffer size of 2 means that the caller only
+ * wants a single key.
+ *
+ * An escape key could be the start of a vt100 control sequence such as \e[D
+ * (left arrow) or it could be a character in its own right.  The standard
+ * method for detecting the difference is to wait for 2 seconds to see if there
+ * are any other characters.  kdb is complicated by the lack of a timer service
+ * (interrupts are off), by multiple input sources and by the need to sometimes
+ * return after just one key.  Escape sequence processing has to be done as
+ * states in the polling loop.

+ *	This function is the entry point for the kernel debugger.  It

+ *

+ *
+ *	The breakpoint trap code should invoke this function with
+ *	one of KDB_REASON_BREAK (int 03) or KDB_REASON_DEBUG (debug register)
+ *

+ *	KDB_REASON_OOPS.
+ *
+ *	The kernel fault handler should invoke this function with
+ *	reason == KDB_REASON_FAULT and error == trap vector #.
+ *
+ *	In single step mode, one cpu is released to run without
+ *	breakpoints.   Interrupts and NMI are reset to their original values,
+ *	the cpu is allowed to do one instruction which causes a trap
+ *	into kdb with KDB_REASON_DEBUG.
+ *
+ * Inputs:
+ *	reason		The reason KDB was invoked
+ *	error		The hardware-defined error code
+ *	regs		The exception frame at time of fault/breakpoint.  If reason
+ *			is KDB_REASON_SILENT then regs is NULL, otherwise it
+ *			should always be valid.
+ * Returns:
+ *	0	KDB was invoked for an event which it wasn't responsible
+ *	1	KDB handled the event for which it was invoked.
+ * Locking:
+ *	none
+ * Remarks:
+ *	No assumptions of system state.  This function may be invoked
+ *	with arbitrary locks held.  It will stop all other processors
+ *	in an SMP environment, disable all interrupts and does not use
+ *	the operating systems keyboard driver.
+ *
+ *	This code is reentrant but only for cpu switch.  Any other
+ *	reentrancy is an error, although kdb will attempt to recover.
+ *
+ *	At the start of a kdb session the initial processor is running
+ *	kdb() and the other processors can be doing anything.  When the
+ *	initial processor calls smp_kdb_stop() the other processors are
+ *	driven through kdb_ipi which calls kdb() with reason SWITCH.
+ *	That brings all processors into this routine, one with a "real"
+ *	reason code, the other with SWITCH.
+ *
+ *	Because the other processors are driven via smp_kdb_stop(),
+ *	they enter here from the NMI handler.  Until the other
+ *	processors exit from here and exit from kdb_ipi, they will not
+ *	take any more NMI requests.  The initial cpu will still take NMI.
+ *
+ *	Multiple race and reentrancy conditions, each with different
+ *	advoidance mechanisms.
+ *
+ *	Two cpus hit debug points at the same time.
+ *
+ *	  kdb_lock and kdb_initial_cpu ensure that only one cpu gets
+ *	  control of kdb.  The others spin on kdb_initial_cpu until
+ *	  they are driven through NMI into kdb_ipi.  When the initial
+ *	  cpu releases the others from NMI, they resume trying to get
+ *	  kdb_initial_cpu to start a new event.
+ *
+ *	A cpu is released from kdb and starts a new event before the
+ *	original event has completely ended.
+ *
+ *	  kdb_previous_event() prevents any cpu from entering
+ *	  kdb_initial_cpu state until the previous event has completely
+ *	  ended on all cpus.
+ *
+ *	An exception occurs inside kdb.
+ *
+ *	  kdb_initial_cpu detects recursive entry to kdb and attempts
+ *	  to recover.  The recovery uses longjmp() which means that
+ *	  recursive calls to kdb never return.  Beware of assumptions
+ *	  like
+ *
+ *	    ++depth;
+ *	    kdb();
+ *	    --depth;
+ *
+ *	  If the kdb call is recursive then longjmp takes over and
+ *	  --depth is never executed.
+ *
+ *	NMI handling.
+ *
+ *	  NMI handling is tricky.  The initial cpu is invoked by some kdb event,
+ *	  this event could be NMI driven but usually is not.  The other cpus are
+ *	  driven into kdb() via kdb_ipi which uses NMI so at the start the other
+ *	  cpus will not accept NMI.  Some operations such as SS release one cpu
+ *	  but hold all the others.  Releasing a cpu means it drops back to
+ *	  whatever it was doing before the kdb event, this means it drops out of
+ *	  kdb_ipi and hence out of NMI status.  But the software watchdog uses
+ *	  NMI and we do not want spurious watchdog calls into kdb.  kdba_read()
+ *	  resets the watchdog counters in its input polling loop, when a kdb
+ *	  command is running it is subject to NMI watchdog events.
+ *
+ *	  Another problem with NMI handling is the NMI used to drive the other
+ *	  cpus into kdb cannot be distinguished from the watchdog NMI.  State
+ *	  flag WAIT_IPI indicates that a cpu is waiting for NMI via kdb_ipi,
+ *	  if not set then software NMI is ignored by kdb_ipi.
+ *
+ *	Cpu switching.
+ *
+ *	  All cpus are in kdb (or they should be), all but one are
+ *	  spinning on KDB_STATE(HOLD_CPU).  Only one cpu is not in
+ *	  HOLD_CPU state, only that cpu can handle commands.
+ *
+ *	Go command entered.
+ *
+ *	  If necessary, go will switch to the initial cpu first.  If the event
+ *	  was caused by a software breakpoint (assumed to be global) that
+ *	  requires single-step to get over the breakpoint then only release the
+ *	  initial cpu, after the initial cpu has single-stepped the breakpoint
+ *	  then release the rest of the cpus.  If SSBPT is not required then
+ *	  release all the cpus at once.

+ *
+ * The stack for the top frame can be in one of several states.
+ *  (0) Immediately on entry to the function, stack pointer (sp) is
+ *      here.
+ *  (1) If the function was compiled with frame pointers and the 'push
+ *      fp' instruction has been executed then the pointer to the
+ *      previous frame is on the stack.  However there is no guarantee
+ *      that this saved pointer is valid, the calling function might
+ *      not have frame pointers.  sp is adjusted by wordsize after
+ *      'push fp'.
+ *  (2) If the function was compiled with frame pointers and the 'copy
+ *      sp to fp' instruction has been executed then fp points here.
+ *  (3) If the function startup has 'adjust sp by 0xnn bytes' and that
+ *      instruction has been executed then sp has been adjusted by
+ *      0xnn bytes for local and automatic variables.
+ *  (4) If the function startup has one or more 'push reg' instructions
+ *      and any have been executed then sp has been adjusted by
+ *      wordsize bytes for each register saved.
+ *
+ * As the function exits it rewinds the stack, typically to (1) then (0).
+ *
+ * The stack entries for the lower frames is normally are in state (5).
+ *  (5) Arguments for the called frame are on to the stack.
+ * However lower frames can be incomplete if there is an interrupt in
+ * progress.
+ *
+ * An activation record runs from the return address for a function
+ * through to the return address for the next function or sp, whichever
+ * comes first.  For each activation record we extract :-
+ *
+ *   start    Address of the activation record.
+ *   end      Address of the last byte+1 in the activation record.
+ *   ret      Return address to caller.
+ *   oldfp    Frame pointer to previous frame, 0 if this function was
+ *	      not compiled with frame pointers.
+ *   fp       Frame pointer for the current frame, 0 if this function
+ *	      was not compiled with frame pointers or fp has not been
+ *	      set yet.
+ *   arg0     Address of the first argument (in the previous activation
+ *	      record).
+ *   locals   Bytes allocated to locals and automatics.
+ *   regs     Bytes allocated to saved registers.
+ *   args     Bytes allocated to arguments (in the previous activation
+ *	      record).
+ *   setup    Bytes allocated to setup data on stack (return address,
+ *	      frame pointer).
+ *
+ * Although the kernel might be compiled with frame pointers, we still
+ * have to assume the worst and validate the frame.  Some calls from
+ * asm code to C code might not use frame pointers.  Third party binary
+ * only modules might be compiled without frame pointers, even when the
+ * rest of the kernel has frame pointers.  Some routines are always
+ * compiled with frame pointers, even if the overall kernel is not.  A
+ * routine compiled with frame pointers can be called from a routine
+ * without frame pointers, the previous "frame pointer" is saved on
+ * stack but it contains garbage.
+ *
+ * We check the object code to see if it saved a frame pointer and we
+ * validate that pointer.  Basically frame pointers are hints.
