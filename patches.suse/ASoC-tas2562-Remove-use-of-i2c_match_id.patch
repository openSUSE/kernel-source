Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: tas2562: Remove use of i2c_match_id()
Git-commit: eb4b5da0ecf61135533574285bacb9dab4fc4703
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc1
References: jsc#PED-14430 jsc#PED-14297 jsc#PED-14024

The function i2c_match_id() is used to fetch the matching ID from
the i2c_device_id table. This is often used to then retrieve the
matching driver_data. This can be done in one step with the helper
i2c_get_match_data().

This helper has a couple other benefits:
 * It doesn't need the i2c_device_id passed in so we do not need
   to have that forward declared, allowing us to remove those or
   move the i2c_device_id table down to its more natural spot
   with the other module info.
 * It also checks for device match data, which allows for OF and
   ACPI based probing. That means we do not have to manually check
   those first and can remove those checks.
