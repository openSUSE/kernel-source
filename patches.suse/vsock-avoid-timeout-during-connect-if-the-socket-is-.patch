Subject: [PATCH] vsock: avoid timeout during connect() if the socket is
 closing

When a peer attempts to establish a connection, vsock_connect() contains
a loop that waits for the state to be TCP_ESTABLISHED. However, the
other peer can be fast enough to accept the connection and close it
immediately, thus moving the state to TCP_CLOSING.

When this happens, the peer in the vsock_connect() is properly woken up,
but since the state is not TCP_ESTABLISHED, it goes back to sleep
until the timeout expires, returning -ETIMEDOUT.

If the socket state is TCP_CLOSING, waiting for the timeout is pointless.
vsock_connect() can return immediately without errors or delay since the
connection actually happened. The socket will be in a closing state,
but this is not an issue, and subsequent calls will fail as expected.

We discovered this issue while developing a test that accepts and
immediately closes connections to stress the transport switch between
two connect() calls, where the first one was interrupted by a signal
(see Closes link).
