Subject: [PATCH 1/1] mm, vmstat: reduce zone->lock holding time by
 /proc/pagetypeinfo

Git-commit: 93b3a674485f6a4b8ffff85d1682d5e8b7c51560
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc7
References: bsc#1175691

pagetypeinfo_showfree_print is called by zone->lock held in irq mode.
This is not really nice because it blocks both any interrupts on that
cpu and the page allocator.  On large machines this might even trigger
the hard lockup detector.

Considering the pagetypeinfo is a debugging tool we do not really need
exact numbers here.  The primary reason to look at the outuput is to see
how pageblocks are spread among different migratetypes and low number of
pages is much more interesting therefore putting a bound on the number
of pages on the free_list sounds like a reasonable tradeoff.

The new output will simply tell
  [...]
  Node    6, zone   Normal, type      Movable >100000 >100000 >100000 >100000  41019  31560  23996  10054   3229    983    648

instead of
  Node    6, zone   Normal, type      Movable 399568 294127 221558 102119  41019  31560  23996  10054   3229    983    648

The limit has been chosen arbitrary and it is a subject of a future
change should there be a need for that.

While we are at it, also drop the zone lock after each free_list
iteration which will help with the IRQ and page allocator responsiveness
even further as the IRQ lock held time is always bound to those 100k
pages.
