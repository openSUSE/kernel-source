Subject: drm/i915/gem: Limit the blitter sizes to ensure low preemption
 latency
Git-commit: 953d57eba5192aab638f2d102e0ee7af0c7b970c
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: bsc#1152489

Currently we insert a arbitration point every 128MiB during a blitter
copy. At 8GiB/s, this is around 30ms. This is a little on the large side
if we need to inject a high priority work, so reduced it down to 8MiB or
roughly 1ms.

v2: Don't forget both fill/copy.
