Subject: vfio-ccw: Enable transparent CCW IPL from DASD
Git-commit: 725b94d74128cd208bfdd446ad6b5f4b38cf5395
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
References: bsc#1175713, jsc#SLE-13665

Remove the explicit prefetch check when using vfio-ccw devices.
This check does not trigger in practice as all Linux channel programs
are intended to use prefetch.

It is expected that all ORBs issued by Linux will request prefetch.
Although non-prefetching ORBs are not rejected, they will prefetch
nonetheless. A warning is issued up to once per 5 seconds when a
forced prefetch occurs.

A non-prefetch ORB does not necessarily result in an error, however
frequent encounters with non-prefetch ORBs indicate that channel
programs are being executed in a way that is inconsistent with what
the guest is requesting. While there is currently no known case of an
error caused by forced prefetch, it is possible in theory that forced
prefetch could result in an error if applied to a channel program that
is dependent on non-prefetch.

 The current code allows the guest to start channel programs via
 START SUBCHANNEL, and to issue HALT SUBCHANNEL and CLEAR SUBCHANNEL.
 
+Currently all channel programs are prefetched, regardless of the
+p-bit setting in the ORB.  As a result, self modifying channel
+programs are not supported.  For this reason, IPL has to be handled as
+a special case by a userspace/guest program; this has been implemented
+in QEMU's s390-ccw bios as of QEMU 4.1.

 vfio-ccw supports classic (command mode) channel I/O only. Transport
 mode (HPF) is not supported.
