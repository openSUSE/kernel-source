Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: relocation: Work around dead relocation stage loop

There are some reports of dead relocation stage loop, where dmesg is
flooded by "Found X extents".

The root cause of it is still uncertain, but we can work around such bug
by checking cancelling request so user can at least cancel such dead
loop.
