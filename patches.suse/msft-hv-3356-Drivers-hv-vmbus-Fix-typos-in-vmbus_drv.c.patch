Subject: Drivers: hv: vmbus: Fix typos in vmbus_drv.c
Git-commit: a3a4d6cb0b968e5d842e79f5dd9d7e07670e9b8a
References: git-fixes

Fix two minor typos in vmbus_drv.c:
- Correct "reponsible" -> "responsible" in a comment.
- Add missing newline in pr_err() message ("channeln" -> "channel\n").

These are cosmetic changes only and do not affect functionality.
