Subject: [PATCH] regulator: resolve supply after creating regulator
Mime-version: 1.0

Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc1
References: git-fixes

When creating a new regulator its supply cannot create the sysfs link
because the device is not yet published. Remove early supply resolving
since it will be done later anyway. This makes the following error
disappear and the symlinks get created instead.

  DCDC_REG1: supplied by VSYS
  VSYS: could not add device link regulator.3 err -2

Note: It doesn't fix the problem for bypassed regulators, though.
