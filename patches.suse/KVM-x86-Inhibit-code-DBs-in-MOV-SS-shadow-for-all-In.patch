Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: Inhibit code #DBs in MOV-SS shadow for all Intel
 compat vCPUs

Treat code #DBs as inhibited in MOV/POP-SS shadows for vCPU models that
are Intel compatible, not just strictly vCPUs with vendor==Intel.  The
behavior is explicitly called out in the SDM, and thus architectural, i.e.
applies to all CPUs that implement Intel's architecture, and isn't a quirk
that is unique to CPUs manufactured by Intel:

  However, if an instruction breakpoint is placed on an instruction located
  immediately after a POP SS/MOV SS instruction, the breakpoint will be
  suppressed as if EFLAGS.RF were 1.

Applying the behavior strictly to Intel wasn't intentional, KVM simply
didn't have a concept of "Intel compatible" as of commit baf67ca8e545
("KVM: x86: Suppress code #DBs on Intel if MOV/POP SS blocking is active").
