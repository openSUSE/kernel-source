Subject: drm/i915/intel_cdclk: Add vdsc with bigjoiner constraints on
 min_cdlck
Git-commit: 7f5ac365261dcbd7e9fb6f4c09d0d363be5b5d4b
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: jsc#PED-3527 jsc#PED-5475 jsc#PED-6068 jsc#PED-6070 jsc#PED-6116 jsc#PED-6120 jsc#PED-5065 jsc#PED-5477 jsc#PED-5511 jsc#PED-6041 jsc#PED-6069 jsc#PED-6071

As per Bsepc:49259, Bigjoiner BW check puts restriction on the
compressed bpp for a given CDCLK, pixelclock in cases where
Bigjoiner + DSC are used.

Currently compressed bpp is computed first, and it is ensured that
the bpp will work at least with the max CDCLK freq.

Since the CDCLK is computed later, lets account for Bigjoiner BW
check while calculating Min CDCLK.

v2: Use pixel clock in the bw calculations. (Ville)

v3: Use helper to account for FEC overhead. (Stan)
