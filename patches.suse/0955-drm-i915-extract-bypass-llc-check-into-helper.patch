Subject: drm/i915: extract bypass-llc check into helper
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: 30f1dccd295b6865fad9e41873dce2f76998cbae
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

It looks like we will need this in some more places, so extract as a
helper.
