Subject: scsi: lpfc: Save FPIN frequency statistics upon receipt of peer cgn
 notifications
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
Git-commit: 6ca396c5e3c4fb3d2df176145d4800e47cd0d18b
References: bsc#1220021

FPIN frequency is provided by the fabric in peer congestion notifications.

Currently, the frequency is only logged in a message, but it should also be
saved into the phba's cgn_fpin statistics member for proper application
functionality.
