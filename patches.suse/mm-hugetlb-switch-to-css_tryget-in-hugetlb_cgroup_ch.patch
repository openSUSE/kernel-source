Subject: mm: hugetlb: switch to css_tryget() in hugetlb_cgroup_charge_cgroup()
Git-commit: 0362f326d86c645b5e96b7dbc3ee515986ed019d
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc8
References: bnc#1151927 5.3.12

An exiting task might belong to an offline cgroup.  In this case an
attempt to grab a cgroup reference from the task can end up with an
infinite loop in hugetlb_cgroup_charge_cgroup(), because neither the
cgroup will become online, neither the task will be migrated to a live
cgroup.

Fix this by switching over to css_tryget().  As css_tryget_online()
can't guarantee that the cgroup won't go offline, in most cases the
check doesn't make sense.  In this particular case users of
hugetlb_cgroup_charge_cgroup() are not affected by this change.

A similar problem is described by commit 18fa84a2db0e ("cgroup: Use
css_tryget() instead of css_tryget_online() in task_get_css()").
