Subject: [PATCH] sched/fair: Increase wakeup_gran if current task has not
 executed the minimum granularity

References: Scheduler enhancements for I7 (bnc#754690, bnc#1144446)
Patch-mainline: Not yet, posted but review pending

Commit 8a99b6833c88 ("sched: Move SCHED_DEBUG sysctl to debugfs")
moved the kernel.sched_wakeup_granularity_ns sysctl under debugfs.
One of the reasons why this sysctl may be used may be for "optimising
for throughput", particularly when overloaded. The tool TuneD sometimes
alters this for two profiles e.g. "mssql" and "throughput-performance". At
least version 2.9 does but it changed in master where it also will poke
at debugfs instead. This patch aims to reduce the motivation to tweak
sysctl_sched_wakeup_granularity by increasing sched_wakeup_granularity
if the running task runtime has not exceeded sysctl_sched_min_granularity.

During task migration or wakeup, a decision is made on whether
to preempt the current task or not. To limit over-scheduled,
sysctl_sched_wakeup_granularity delays the preemption to allow at least 1ms
of runtime before preempting. However, when a domain is heavily overloaded
(e.g. hackbench), the degree of over-scheduling is still severe. This is
problematic as time is wasted rescheduling tasks that could instead be
used by userspace tasks.

However, care must be taken. Even if a system is overloaded, there may
be high priority threads that must still be able to run. Mike Galbraith
explained the constraints as follows;

        CFS came about because the O1 scheduler was unfair to the
        point it had starvation problems. People pretty much across the
        board agreed that a fair scheduler was a much way better way
        to go, and CFS was born.  It didn't originally have the sleep
        credit business, but had to grow it to become _short term_ fair.
        Ingo cut the sleep credit in half because of overscheduling, and
        that has worked out pretty well all told.. but now you're pushing
        it more in the unfair direction, all the way to extremely unfair
        for anything and everything very light.

        Fairness isn't the holy grail mind you, and at some point, giving
        up on short term fairness certainly isn't crazy, as proven by your
        hackbench numbers and other numbers we've seen over the years,
        but taking bites out of the 'CF' in the CFS that was born to be a
        corner-case killer is.. worrisome.  The other shoe will drop.. it
        always does :)

This patch increases the wakeup granularity if the current task has not
reached its minimum preemption granularity. The current task may still
be preempted but the difference in runtime must be higher.
