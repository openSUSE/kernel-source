Subject: nbd: add a flush_workqueue in nbd_start_device
Git-commit: 5c0dd228b5fc30a3b732c7ae2657e0161ec7ed80
Patch-mainline: 5.6-rc1
References: git-fixes

When kzalloc fail, may cause trying to destroy the
workqueue from inside the workqueue.

If num_connections is m (2 < m), and NO.1 ~ NO.n
(1 < n < m) kzalloc are successful. The NO.(n + 1)
failed. Then, nbd_start_device will return ENOMEM
to nbd_start_device_ioctl, and nbd_start_device_ioctl
will return immediately without running flush_workqueue.
However, we still have n recv threads. If nbd_release
run first, recv threads may have to drop the last
config_refs and try to destroy the workqueue from
inside the workqueue.

To fix it, add a flush_workqueue in nbd_start_device.
