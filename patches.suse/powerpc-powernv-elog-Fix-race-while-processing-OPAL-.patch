Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/powernv/elog: Fix race while processing OPAL error
 log event.

References: bsc#1065729
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc1
Git-commit: aea948bb80b478ddc2448f7359d574387521a52d

Every error log reported by OPAL is exported to userspace through a
sysfs interface and notified using kobject_uevent(). The userspace
daemon (opal_errd) then reads the error log and acknowledges the error
log is saved safely to disk. Once acknowledged the kernel removes the
respective sysfs file entry causing respective resources to be
released including kobject.

However it's possible the userspace daemon may already be scanning
elog entries when a new sysfs elog entry is created by the kernel.
User daemon may read this new entry and ack it even before kernel can
notify userspace about it through kobject_uevent() call. If that
happens then we have a potential race between
elog_ack_store->kobject_put() and kobject_uevent which can lead to
use-after-free of a kernfs object resulting in a kernel crash. eg:

  BUG: Unable to handle kernel data access on read at 0x6b6b6b6b6b6b6bfb

    ret_from_kernel_thread+0x5c/0x6c

This patch fixes this race by protecting the sysfs file
creation/notification by holding a reference count on kobject until we
safely send kobject_uevent().

The function create_elog_obj() returns the elog object which if used
by caller function will end up in use-after-free problem again.
However, the return value of create_elog_obj() function isn't being
used today and there is no need as well. Hence change it to return
void to make this fix complete.
