Subject: KVM: arm64: Make vcpu_cp1x() work on Big Endian hosts
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
Git-commit: 3204be4109ad681523e3461ce64454c79278450a
References: bsc#1133021

AArch32 CP1x registers are overlayed on their AArch64 counterparts
in the vcpu struct. This leads to an interesting problem as they
are stored in their CPU-local format, and thus a CP1x register
doesn't "hit" the lower 32bit portion of the AArch64 register on
a BE host.

To workaround this unfortunate situation, introduce a bias trick
in the vcpu_cp1x() accessors which picks the correct half of the
64bit register.
