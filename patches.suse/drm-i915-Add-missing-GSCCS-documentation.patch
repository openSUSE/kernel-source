Subject: drm/i915: Add missing GSCCS documentation
Git-commit: 587e80dc1cb5f1f3f41b38356d3e3563c01d9d8e
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1

Introduce the basic documentation about GSC CS.

This "GPU Basics" section is focused on explaining the hardware

properly documented here.

v2: Fixes from Matt: typos and acronym.
