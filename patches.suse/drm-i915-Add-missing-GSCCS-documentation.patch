Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: Add missing GSCCS documentation
Git-commit: 587e80dc1cb5f1f3f41b38356d3e3563c01d9d8e
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: git-fixes

Introduce the basic documentation about GSC CS.

This "GPU Basics" section is focused on explaining the hardware
rather than the driver/uapi, so let's make sure GSC is also
properly documented here.

V2: Fixes from Matt: typos and acronym.
