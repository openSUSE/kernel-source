Subject: [PATCH] serial: 8250_port: Don't service RX FIFO if throttled
Git-commit: f19c3f6c8109b8bab000afd35580929958e087a9
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: git-fixes

When port's throttle callback is called, it should stop pushing any more
data into TTY buffer to avoid buffer overflow. This means driver has to
stop HW from receiving more data and assert the HW flow control. For
UARTs with auto HW flow control (such as 8250_omap) manual assertion of
flow control line is not possible and only way is to allow RX FIFO to
fill up, thus trigger auto HW flow control logic.

Therefore make sure that 8250 generic IRQ handler does not drain data
when port is stopped (i.e UART_LSR_DR is unset in read_status_mask). Not
servicing, RX FIFO would trigger auto HW flow control when FIFO
occupancy reaches preset threshold, thus halting RX.
Since, error conditions in UART_LSR register are cleared just by reading
the register, data has to be drained in case there are FIFO errors, else
error information will lost.
