Subject: [PATCH] ext4: verify orphan file size is not too big
Git-commit: 0a6ce20c156442a4ce2a404747bb0fb05d54eeb3
Patch-mainline: v6.18-rc1
References: bsc#1253442 CVE-2025-40179

In principle orphan file can be arbitrarily large. However orphan replay
needs to traverse it all and we also pin all its buffers in memory. Thus
filesystems with absurdly large orphan files can lead to big amounts of
memory consumed. Limit orphan file size to a sane value and also use
kvmalloc() for allocating array of block descriptor structures to avoid
large order allocations for sane but large orphan files.
