Subject: intel_idle: add SPR support
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
Git-commit: 9edf3c0ffef0ec1bed8300315852b5c6a0997130
References: bsc#1198602

Add Sapphire Rapids Xeon support.

Up until very recently, the C1 and C1E C-states were independent, but this
has changed in some new chips, including Sapphire Rapids Xeon (SPR). In these
chips the C1 and C1E states cannot be enabled at the same time. The "C1E
promotion" bit in 'MSR_IA32_POWER_CTL' also has its semantics changed a bit.

Here are the C1, C1E, and "C1E promotion" bit rules on Xeons before SPR.

1. If C1E promotion bit is disabled.
   a. C1  requests end up with C1  C-state.
   b. C1E requests end up with C1E C-state.
2. If C1E promotion bit is enabled.
   a. C1  requests end up with C1E C-state.
   b. C1E requests end up with C1E C-state.

Here are the C1, C1E, and "C1E promotion" bit rules on Sapphire Rapids Xeon.
1. If C1E promotion bit is disabled.
   a. C1  requests end up with C1 C-state.
   b. C1E requests end up with C1 C-state.
2. If C1E promotion bit is enabled.
   a. C1  requests end up with C1E C-state.
   b. C1E requests end up with C1E C-state.

Before SPR Xeon, the 'intel_idle' driver was disabling C1E promotion and was
exposing C1 and C1E as independent C-states. But on SPR, C1 and C1E cannot be
enabled at the same time.

This patch adds both C1 and C1E states. However, C1E is marked as with the
"CPUIDLE_FLAG_UNUSABLE" flag, which means that in won't be registered by
default. The C1E promotion bit will be cleared, which means that by default
only C1 and C6 will be registered on SPR.

The next patch will add an option for enabling C1E and disabling C1 on SPR.
