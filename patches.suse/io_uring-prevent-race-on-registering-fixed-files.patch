Subject: [PATCH] io_uring: prevent race on registering fixed files
Patch-mainline: Never, specific to 15SP3
References: bsc#1210414 CVE-2023-1872

in 5.3, io_sqe_files_unregister is called without holding the io_uring ctx lock
when in sqpoll,which means it can race with the io_sqe_files_unregister.  This
was fixed in commit 8a4955ff1cca7d4da480774034a16e7c28bafec8 ("io_uring:
sqthread should grab ctx->uring_lock for submissions"), but this has quite a few
dependencies that we don't want to carry in SP3.

This version, instead, only acquires the lock prior to registering the files in
the sqpoll path and releases right after, which should be safe todo and doesn't
add extra dependencies.
