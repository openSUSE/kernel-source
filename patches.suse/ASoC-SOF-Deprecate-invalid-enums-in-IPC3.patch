Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: SOF: Deprecate invalid enums in IPC3
Git-commit: 8dc97ccf94c73c62344a270986b837d02fb77c0f
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc1
References: bsc#1233305

The switch component was never completed and sat half empty for over 3
years. It was recently deleted. For modern components this would
require not change in the kernel but since this was a legacy allocation
from the enum days of IPC3 we should mark the respective enum as
deprecated.

The splitter component was never even got a source file in the firmware.
Therefore also delete it since this is not needed.
