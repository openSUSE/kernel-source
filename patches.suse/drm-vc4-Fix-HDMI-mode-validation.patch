Subject: drm/vc4: Fix HDMI mode validation
Git-commit: b1e7396a1d0e6af6806337fdaaa44098d6b3343c
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-12680, jsc#SLE-12880, jsc#SLE-12882, jsc#SLE-12883, jsc#SLE-13496, jsc#SLE-15322

Current mode validation impedes setting up some video modes which should
be supported otherwise. Namely 1920x1200@60Hz.

Fix this by lowering the minimum HDMI state machine clock to pixel clock
ratio allowed.

Fixes: 32e823c63e90 ("drm/vc4: Reject HDMI modes with too high of clocks.")
