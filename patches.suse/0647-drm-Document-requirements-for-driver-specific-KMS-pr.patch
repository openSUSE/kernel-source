Subject: drm: Document requirements for driver-specific KMS props in new
 drivers
Git-commit: f99885b15b2d230d2d1d75e5e542ecaacd29733f
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc1

When extending support for a driver-specific KMS property to additional
drivers, we should apply all the requirements for new properties and
make sure the semantics are the same and documented.

v2: devs of the driver which introduced property shall help and ack

+For historical reasons, non-standard, driver-specific properties exist. If a KMS
+driver wants to add support for one of those properties, the requirements for
+new properties apply where possible. Additionally, the documented behavior must
+match the de facto semantics of the existing property to ensure compatibility.
