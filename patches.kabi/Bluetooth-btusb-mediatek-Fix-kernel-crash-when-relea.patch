Subject: kABI workaround for hci_conn remote_id removal
Patch-mainline: Never, kABI workaround
References: git-fixes

The backport of the BT fix commit 4015b9797671 removed remote_id
field from struct hci_conn, as it the field isn't used any longer,
but this broke kABI, unfortunately.

Just revive the field as a placeholder for keeping kABI.
