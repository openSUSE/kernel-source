Subject: [PATCH] kABI: Fix kABI after "mm/rmap: Fix anon_vma->degree ambiguity
 leading to double-reuse"
Patch-mainline; Never, SUSE kABI
References: git-fixes, bsc#1203098

The patch changes struct anon_vma which is exposed, although should not be used
by any non-core code. Move the new fields to the end (hidden from KABI checker)
and restore the removed degree field so the layout doesn't change within the old
size.
