Subject: mbcache: Fixup kABI of mb_cache_entry
References: bsc#1207653 bsc#1219915
Patch-mainline: Never, kABI

Fixup kABI due to conversion from a bitfield to atomic flags. This kABI
breakage is basically impossible to 100% fixup in a transparent way as it is
fundamental in fixing the problem. But as far as we know there are no out of
tree users of mbcache so let's just try and overlay new flags field over the
old bitfields and hope that the compiler will use the same bit numbers...
