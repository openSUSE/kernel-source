    tg3_get_invariants(), among other things, discovers whether or not

    tg3 / broadcom: Add code to disable rxc refclk
    
    The 5785 does not use the RXC reference clock.  Turning it off is
    desirable as it saves power.
    
    By default, the 50610 enables the RXC reference clock and the 50610M
    disables it.  Presumably this is one of the reasons why the hardware
    architect chose one over the other.
    
    Adding a "rx reference clock disable" flag is not the ideal way to
    describe the option, as it would force the MAC using a 50610M to set
    the flag.  Ideally we want the flags to represent opt-in behavior that
    deviates from hardware defaults.  Furthermore, the lack of a
    "disable" flag implies that the requester wants the rx reference clock
    enabled, which doesn't necessarily follow.
    
    By presenting the option as a passive statement (rx reference clock
    unused) rather than a command, I hope to convey an opt-in option to
    disable the rx reference clock that falls back to hardware defaults if
    not set.  A secondary benefit of this is that it keeps the
    intelligence about phy defaults in the broadcom module where it belongs
    and allows the broadcom module more latitude should a bug arise.

    Broadcom 50610M parts changed the default definitions of the RGMII mode
    shadow register.  The 5785 needs the RGMII mode selection bits [4:3]

    The default value of the remaining bits in this register are zero.
    Rather than unnecessarily burn an extra bit in the dev_flags member in
    an attempt to enumerate all possible combinations, this patch take a
    more course grained approach and labels the option as "clear all bits".

    tg3: Extend loopback test timeout
    
    This patch extends the loopback test timeout from 250 usec to 350 usec.
    When the 5785 is paired against an AC131 phy, the older timeout is
    just a little too close to the expected performance based on timings.

    tg3: 5785: Set port mode to MII when link down
    
    This patch sets the port mode to MII when the link is down for the 5785.
    Setting the port mode to MII instead of GMII saves power.

    tg3: Add AC131 power down support
    
    The AC131 does not respect the power down bit (bit 11) of the MII
    Control Register (reg 0x0).  Instead, software is required to put the
    phy into standby power down mode through the shadow register set.  This
    patch implements support for the AC131 standby power down mode.
