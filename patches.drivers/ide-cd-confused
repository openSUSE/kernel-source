Subject: Fix CDROM being confused
Patch-mainline: 2.6.18-rc2
References: 147863

I have seen the cdrom drive appearing confused on using kdump on certain
x86_64 systems.  During the booting up of the second kernel, the following
message would keep flooding the console, and the booting would not proceed
any further.

Hda: cdrom_pc_intr: The drive appears confused (ireason = 0x01)

In this patch, whenever we are hitting a confused state in the interrupt
handler with the DRQ set, we end the request and return ide_stopped.  Using
this I dont see the status error.
