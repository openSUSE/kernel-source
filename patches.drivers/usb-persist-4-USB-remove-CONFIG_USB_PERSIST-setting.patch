Subject: [PATCH 4/6] USB: remove CONFIG_USB_PERSIST setting
Patch-mainline: 2.6.26

This patch (as1047) removes the USB_PERSIST Kconfig option, enabling
it permanently.  It also prevents the power/persist attribute from
being created for hub devices; there's no point in having it since
USB-PERSIST is always turned on for hubs.
