Subject: [PATCH 14/23] firmware: fix BUG: in fw_realloc_buffer
Patch-Mainline: 2.6.16.1

The fw_realloc_buffer routine does not handle an increase in buffer size of
more than 4k.  It's not clear to me why it expects that it will only get an
extra 4k of data.  The attached patch modifies fw_realloc_buffer to vmalloc
as much memory as is requested, instead of what we previously had + 4k.

I've tested this on my laptop, which would crash occaisionally on boot
without the patch.  With the patch, it hasn't crashed, but I can't be
certain that this code path is exercised.
