I noticed that the VT switch doesn't work any longer with a Dell
laptop with 1366x768 eDP when the machine is connected with a DP
monitor.  It behaves as if VT were switched, but the graphics remain
frozen.  Actually the keyboard works, so I could switch back to VT7
again.

I tried to track down the problem, and encountered a long story until
we reach to this error:

- The machine is booted with video=1366x768 option (the distro
  installer seems to add it as default).
- Recently, drm_helper_probe_single_connector_modes() deals with
  cmdline modes, and it tries to create a new mode when no
  matching mode is found.
- The drm_mode_create_from_cmdline_mode() creates a mode based on
  either CVT of GFT according to the given cmdline mode; in our case,
  it's 1366x768.
- Since both CVT and GFT can't express the width 1366 due to
  alignment, the resultant mode becomes 1368x768, slightly larger than
  the given size.
- Later on, the atomic commit is performed, and in
  drm_atomic_check_only(), the size of each plane is checked.
- The size check of 1366x768 fails due to the above, and eventually
  the whole VT switch fails.

Back in the history, we've had a manual fix-up of 1368x768 in various
places via c09dedb7a50e ("drm/edid: Add a workaround for 1366x768 HD
panel"), but they have been all in drm_edid.c at probing the modes
from EDID.  For addressing the problem above, we need a similar hack
to the mode newly created from cmdline, manually adjusting the width
when the expected size is 1366 while we get 1368 instead.
