Subject: [PATCH] e1000: enhance frame fragment detection
References: bnc#567376, CVE-2009-4536
Patch-Mainline: Yes

A security discussion was recently given:
http://events.ccc.de/congress/2009/Fahrplan//events/3596.en.html And a patch
that I submitted awhile back was brought up.  Apparently some of their testing
revealed that they were able to force a buffer fragment in e1000 in which the
trailing fragment was greater than 4 bytes.  As a result the fragment check I
introduced failed to detect the fragement and a partial invalid frame was
passed up into the network stack.  I've written this patch to correct it.  I'm
in the process of testing it now, but it makes good logical sense to me.
Effectively it maintains a per-adapter state variable which detects a non-EOP
frame, and discards it and subsequent non-EOP frames leading up to _and_
_including_ the next positive-EOP frame (as it is by definition the last
fragment).  This should prevent any and all partial frames from entering the
network stack from e1000.
