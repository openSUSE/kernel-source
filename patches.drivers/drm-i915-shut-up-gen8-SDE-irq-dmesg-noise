Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: shut up gen8+ SDE irq dmesg noise
Git-commit: 97e5ed1111dcc5300a0f59a55248cd243937a8ab
Git-repo: git://anongit.freedesktop.org/drm-intel
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
References: bsc#954757

We get tons of cases where the master interrupt handler apparently set
a bit, with the SDEIIR disagreeing. No idea what's going on there, but
it's consistent on gen8+, no one seems to care about it and it's
making CI results flaky.

Shut it up.

No idea what's going on here, but we've had fun with PCH interrupts

    drm/i915: also disable south interrupts when handling them

Note that there's a regression report in Bugzilla, and other
regression reports on the mailing lists keep croping up. But no ill
effects have ever been reported. But for paranoia still keep the
message at a debug level as a breadcrumb, just in case.

This message was introduced in
