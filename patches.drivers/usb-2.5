+Revision 3, 2003-10-04
+Jean Delvare <khali@linux-fr.org>
+Greg KH <greg@kroah.com>
+
+This is a guide on how to convert I2C chip drivers from Linux 2.4 to
+Linux 2.6. I have been using existing drivers (lm75, lm78) as examples.
+Then I converted a driver myself (lm83) and updated this document.
+
+There are two sets of points below. The first set concerns technical
+changes. The second set concerns coding policy. Both are mandatory.
+
+Although reading this guide will help you porting drivers, I suggest
+you keep an eye on an already ported driver while porting your own
+driver. This will help you a lot understanding what this guide
+exactly means. Choose the chip driver that is the more similar to
+yours for best results.
+
+Technical changes:
+
+* [Includes] Get rid of "version.h". Replace <linux/i2c-proc.h> with
+  <linux/i2c-sensor.h>. Includes typically look like that:
+  #include <linux/module.h>
+  #include <linux/init.h>
+  #include <linux/slab.h>
+  #include <linux/i2c.h>
+  #include <linux/i2c-sensor.h>
+  #include <linux/i2c-vid.h>     /* if you need VRM support */
+  #include <asm/io.h>            /* if you have I/O operations */
+  Some extra headers may be required for a given driver.
+
+* [Addresses] SENSORS_I2C_END becomes I2C_CLIENT_END, SENSORS_ISA_END
+  becomes I2C_CLIENT_ISA_END.
+
+* [Client data] Get rid of sysctl_id. Try using standard names for
+  register values (for example, temp_os becomes temp_max). You're
+  still relatively free here, but you *have* to follow the standard
+  names for sysfs files (see the Sysctl section below).
+
+* [Function prototypes] The detect functions loses its flags
+  parameter. Sysctl (e.g. lm75_temp) and miscellaneous (e.g.
+  swap_bytes) functions are off the list of prototypes. This
+  usually leaves five prototypes:
+  static int lm75_attach_adapter(struct i2c_adapter *adapter);
+  static int lm75_detect(struct i2c_adapter *adapter, int address,
+      int kind);
+  static void lm75_init_client(struct i2c_client *client);
+  static int lm75_detach_client(struct i2c_client *client);
+  static void lm75_update_client(struct i2c_client *client);
+
+* [Sysctl] All sysctl stuff is of course gone (defines, ctl_table
+  and functions). Instead, right after the static id definition
+  line, you have to define show and set functions for each sysfs
+  file. Only define set for writable values. Take a look at an
+  existing 2.6 driver for details (lm78 for example). Don't forget
+  to define the attributes for each file (this is that step that
+  links callback functions). Use the file names specified in
+  Documentation/i2c/sysfs-interface for the individual files. Also
+  convert the units these files read and write to the specified ones.
+  If you need to add a new type of file, please discuss it on the
+  sensors mailing list <sensors@stimpy.netroedge.com> by providing a
+  patch to the Documentation/i2c/sysfs-interface file.
+
+* [Attach] For I2C drivers, the attach function should make sure
+  that the adapter's class has I2C_ADAP_CLASS_SMBUS, using the
+  following construct:
+  if (!(adapter->class & I2C_ADAP_CLASS_SMBUS))
+          return 0;
+  ISA-only drivers of course don't need this.
+
+* [Detect] As mentioned earlier, the flags parameter is gone.
+  The type_name and client_name strings are replaced by a single
+  name string, which will be filled with a lowercase, short string
+  (typically the driver name, e.g. "lm75"). The errorN labels are
+  reduced to the number needed. If that number is 2 (i2c-only
+  drivers), it is advised that the labels are named exit and
+  exit_free. For i2c+isa drivers, labels should be named ERROR0,
+  ERROR1 and ERROR2. Don't forget to properly set err before
+  jumping to error labels. By the way, labels should be
+  left-aligned.
+  Use memset to fill the client and data area with 0x00.
+  Use i2c_set_clientdata to set the client data (as opposed to
+  a direct access to client->data).
+  Use strlcpy instead of strcpy to copy the client name.
+  Replace the sysctl directory registration by calls to
+  device_create_file. Move the driver initialization before any
+  sysfs file creation.
+
+* [Detach] Get rid of data, remove the call to
+  i2c_deregister_entry.
+
+* [Update] Don't access client->data directly, use
+  i2c_get_clientdata(client) instead.
+
+* [Interface] Init function should not print anything. Make sure
+  there is a MODULE_LICENSE() line.
+
+Coding policy:
+
+* [Copyright] Use (C), not (c), for copyright.
+
+* [Debug/log] Get rid of #ifdef DEBUG/#endif constructs whenever you
+  can. Calls to printk/pr_debug for debugging purposes are replaced
+  by calls to dev_dbg. Here is an example on how to call it (taken
+  from lm75_detect):
+  dev_dbg(&adapter->dev,
+          "lm75_detect called for an ISA bus adapter?!?\n");
+  Replace other printk calls with the dev_info, dev_err or dev_warn
+  function, as appropriate.
+
+* [Constants] Constants defines (registers, conversions, initial
+  values) should be aligned. This greatly improves readability.
+  Same goes for variables declarations. Alignments are achieved by the
+  means of tabs, not spaces. Remember that tabs are set to 8 in the
+  Linux kernel code.
+
+* [Structure definition] The name field should be standardized. All
+  lowercase and as simple as the driver name itself (e.g. "lm75").
+
+* [Layout] Avoid extra empty lines between comments and what they
+  comment. Respect the coding style (see Documentation/CodingStyle),
+  in particular when it comes to placing curly braces.

-==================

-and some process has entered that directory (this last case is the
-main reason why these call-backs were introduced).
-
-To increase or decrease the module usage count, you can use the

+
+
+3. Overview
+===========
+This driver supports the video streaming capabilities of the devices mounting
+Winbond W9967CF and Winbond W9968CF JPEG USB Dual Mode Camera Chips, when they
+are being commanded by USB.
+
+The driver relies on the Video4Linux, USB and I2C core modules of the Linux
+kernel, version 2.6.0 or greater, and is not compatible in any way with
+previous versions. It has been designed to run properly on SMP systems
+as well. At the moment, an additional module, "ovcamchip", is mandatory; it
+provides support for some OmniVision CMOS sensors connected to the W996[87]CF
+chips.
+
+The driver is split into two modules: the basic one, "w9968cf", is needed for
+the supported devices to work; the second one, "w9968cf-vpp", is an optional
+module, which provides some useful video post-processing functions like video
+decoding, up-scaling and colour conversions. These routines can't be included
+into official kernels for performance purposes. Once the driver is installed,
+every time an application tries to open a recognized device, "w9968cf" checks
+the presence of the "w9968cf-vpp" module and loads it automatically by default.
+
+Up to 32 cameras can be handled at the same time. They can be connected and
+disconnected from the host many times without turning off the computer, if
+your system supports the hotplug facility.
+
+To change the default settings for each camera, many paramaters can be passed
+through command line when the module is loaded into memory.
+
+The latest and full featured version of the W996[87]CF driver can be found at:
+http://go.lamarinapunto.com/
+
+The "ovcamchip" module is part of the OV511 driver, version 2.25, which can be
+downloaded from internet:
+http://alpha.dyndns.org/ov511/
+To know how to patch, compile and load it, read the paragraphs below.
+
+
+4. Supported devices
+====================
+At the moment, known W996[87]CF based devices are:
+- Aroma Digi Pen ADG-5000 Refurbished
+- AVerTV USB
+- Creative Labs Video Blaster WebCam Go
+- Creative Labs Video Blaster WebCam Go Plus
+- Die Lebon LDC-D35A Digital Kamera
+- Ezonics EZ-802 EZMega Cam
+- OPCOM Digi Pen VGA Dual Mode Pen Camera
+
+If you know any other W996[87]CF based cameras, please contact me.
+
+The list above does NOT imply that all those devices work with this driver: up
+until now only webcams that have a CMOS sensor supported by the "ovcamchip"
+module work. 
+For a list of supported CMOS sensors, please visit the module author homepage:
+http://alpha.dyndns.org/ov511/
+
+Possible external microcontrollers of those webcams are not supported: this
+means that still images can't be downloaded from the device memory.
+
+Furthermore, it's worth to note that I was only able to run tests on my
+"Creative Labs Video Blaster WebCam Go". Donations of other models, for
+additional testing and full support, would be much appreciated.
+
+
+5. Kernel configuration and third-part module compilation
+=========================================================
+As noted above, kernel 2.6.0 is the minimum for this driver; for it to work
+properly, the driver needs kernel support for Video4Linux, USB and I2C, and a
+third-part module for the CMOS sensor.
+
+The following options of the kernel configuration file must be enabled and
+corresponding modules must be compiled:
+
+	# Multimedia devices
+	#
+	CONFIG_VIDEO_DEV=m
+
+	# I2C support
+	#
+	CONFIG_I2C=m
+
+The I2C core module can be compiled statically in the kernel as well.
+
+	# USB support
+	#
+	CONFIG_USB=m
+
+In addition, depending on the hardware being used, just one of the modules
+below is necessary:
+
+	# USB Host Controller Drivers
+	#
+	CONFIG_USB_EHCI_HCD=m
+	CONFIG_USB_UHCI_HCD=m
+	CONFIG_USB_OHCI_HCD=m
+
+Also, make sure "Enforce bandwidth allocation" is NOT enabled.
+
+	# USB Multimedia devices
+	#
+	CONFIG_USB_W9968CF=m
+
+The last module we need is "ovcamchip.o". To obtain it, you have to download
+the OV511 driver, version 2.25 - don't use other versions - which is available
+at http://alpha.dyndns.org/ov511/ . Then you have to download the latest 
+version of the full featured W996[87]CF driver, which contains a patch for the
+"ovcamchip" module; it is available at http://go.lamarinapunto.com .
+Once you have obtained the packages, decompress, patch and compile the 
+"ovcamchip" module. In other words:
+
+	[user@localhost home]$ tar xvzf w9968cf-x.x.tar.gz
+	[user@localhost home]$ tar xvjf ov511-2.25.tar.bz2
+	[user@localhost home]$ cd ov511-2.25
+	[user@localhost ov511-2.25]$ patch -p1 <                              \
+	                             /path/to/w9968cf-x.x/ov511-2.25.patch
+	[user@localhost ov511-2.25]$ make
+
+It's worth to note that the full featured version of the W996[87]CF driver
+can also be installed overwriting the one in the kernel; in this case, read the
+documentation included in the package.
+
+If everything went well, the W996[87]CF driver can be immediatly used (see next
+paragraph).
+
+
+6. Module loading
+=================
+To use the driver, it is necessary to load the "w9968cf" module into memory
+after every other module required.
+
+For example, loading can be done this way, as root:
+
+	[root@localhost home]# modprobe usbcore
+	[root@localhost home]# modprobe i2c-core
+	[root@localhost ov511-x.xx]# insmod ./ovcamchip.ko
+	[root@localhost home]# modprobe w9968cf
+
+At this point the devices should be recognized: "dmesg" can be used to analyze
+kernel messages:
+
+	[user@localhost home]$ dmesg
+
+There are a lot of parameters the module can use to change the default
+settings for each device. To list every possible parameter with a brief
+explanation about them and which syntax to use, it is recommended to run the
+"modinfo" command:
+
+	[root@locahost home]# modinfo w9968cf
+
+
+7. Module paramaters
+====================

+==========
+The development would not have proceed much further without having looked at
+the source code of other drivers and without the help of several persons; in
+particular:
+
+- the I2C interface to kernel and high-level CMOS sensor control routines have
+  been taken from the OV511 driver by Mark McClelland;
+
+- memory management code has been copied from the bttv driver by Ralph Metzler,
+  Marcus Metzler and Gerd Knorr;
+
+- the low-level I2C read function has been written by Frédéric Jouault, who
+  also gave me commented logs about sniffed USB traffic taken from another
+  driver for another system;
+
+- the low-level I2C fast write function has been written by Piotr Czerczak;

+	  Say Y here if you want support for cameras based on
+	  Winbond W9967CF/W9968CF JPEG USB Dual Mode Camera Chips.
+	
+	  This driver has an optional plugin, which is distributed as a
+	  separate module only (released under GPL). It contains code that 
+	  allows you to use higher resolutions and framerates, and can't
+	  be included into the official Linux kernel for performance 
+	  purposes.
+	  At the moment the driver needs a third-part module for the CMOS 
+	  sensors, which is available on internet: it is recommended to read
+	  <file:Documentation/usb/w9968cf.txt> for more informations and for
+	  a list of supported cameras.
+	
+	  This driver uses the Video For Linux and the I2C APIs. 
+	  You must say Y or M to both "Video For Linux" and 
+	  "I2C Support" to use this driver.
+	  Information on this API and pointers to "v4l" programs may be found
+	  on the WWW at <http://roadrunner.swansea.uk.linux.org/v4l.shtml>.
+	
+	  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
+	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
+	  The module will be called w9968cf.o. If you want to compile it as a
+	  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

+ *   - removed IOCTL (setting power/mode is more complicated, postponed)
+ * 2001-11-28 - 0.4 js
+ *   - added vendor commands for mode of operation and power level in open
+ * 2001-12-04 - 0.5 js
+ *   - set IR mode by default (by oversight 0.4 set VLL mode)
+ * 2002-01-11 - 0.5? pcchan
+ *   - make read buffer reusable and work around bytes_to_write issue between
+ *     uhci and legusbtower
+ * 2002-09-23 - 0.52 david (david@csse.uwa.edu.au)
+ *   - imported into lejos project
+ *   - changed wake_up to wake_up_interruptible
+ *   - changed to use lego0 rather than tower0
+ *   - changed dbg() to use __func__ rather than deprecated __FUNCTION__
+ * 2003-01-12 - 0.53 david (david@csse.uwa.edu.au)
+ *   - changed read and write to write everything or timeout (from a patch by Chris Riesen and 
+ *     Brett Thaeler driver)
+ *   - added ioctl functionality to set timeouts
+ * 2003-07-18 - 0.54 davidgsf (david@csse.uwa.edu.au) 
+ *   - initial import into LegoUSB project
+ *   - merge of existing LegoUSB.c driver
+ * 2003-07-18 - 0.56 davidgsf (david@csse.uwa.edu.au) 
+ *   - port to 2.6 style driver

+   word product in HIGH_PROD and LOW_PROD.
+
+   2) __umulsidi3(a,b) multiplies two UWtype integers A and B, and returns a
+   UDWtype product.  This is just a variant of umul_ppmm.
+
+   3) udiv_qrnnd(quotient, remainder, high_numerator, low_numerator,
+   denominator) divides a UDWtype, composed by the UWtype integers
+   HIGH_NUMERATOR and LOW_NUMERATOR, by DENOMINATOR and places the quotient
+   in QUOTIENT and the remainder in REMAINDER.	HIGH_NUMERATOR must be less
+   than DENOMINATOR for correct operation.  If, in addition, the most
+   significant bit of DENOMINATOR must be 1, then the pre-processor symbol
+   UDIV_NEEDS_NORMALIZATION is defined to 1.
+
+   4) sdiv_qrnnd(quotient, remainder, high_numerator, low_numerator,
+   denominator).  Like udiv_qrnnd but the numbers are signed.  The quotient
+   is rounded towards 0.
+
+   5) count_leading_zeros(count, x) counts the number of zero-bits from the
+   msb to the first non-zero bit in the UWtype X.  This is the number of
+   steps X needs to be shifted left to set the msb.  Undefined for X == 0,
+   unless the symbol COUNT_LEADING_ZEROS_0 is defined to some value.
+
+   6) count_trailing_zeros(count, x) like count_leading_zeros, but counts
+   from the least significant end.
+
+   7) add_ssaaaa(high_sum, low_sum, high_addend_1, low_addend_1,
+   high_addend_2, low_addend_2) adds two UWtype integers, composed by
+   HIGH_ADDEND_1 and LOW_ADDEND_1, and HIGH_ADDEND_2 and LOW_ADDEND_2
+   respectively.  The result is placed in HIGH_SUM and LOW_SUM.  Overflow
+   (i.e. carry out) is not stored anywhere, and is lost.
+
+   8) sub_ddmmss(high_difference, low_difference, high_minuend, low_minuend,
+   high_subtrahend, low_subtrahend) subtracts two two-word UWtype integers,
+   composed by HIGH_MINUEND_1 and LOW_MINUEND_1, and HIGH_SUBTRAHEND_2 and
+   LOW_SUBTRAHEND_2 respectively.  The result is placed in HIGH_DIFFERENCE
+   and LOW_DIFFERENCE.	Overflow (i.e. carry out) is not stored anywhere,
