Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda: Use ALC260_WILL quirk for another Acer model (0x1025007f)
Patch-mainline: 2.6.33-rc1
References: 

Buglink: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/418627

The original reporter states that this quirk is necessary to obtain
reasonable gain for playback.  Without it, sound is inaudible.  Tested
with playback (spkr and hp) and capture.
