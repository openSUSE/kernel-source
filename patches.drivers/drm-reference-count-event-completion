Subject: [PATCH] drm: reference count event->completion
Git-commit: 24835e442f289813aa568d142a755672a740503c
References: bsc#1013576
Git-repo: git://anongit.freedesktop.org/drm-intel
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository

When writing the generic nonblocking commit code I assumed that
through clever lifetime management I can assure that the completion
(stored in drm_crtc_commit) only gets freed after it is completed. And
that worked.

I also wanted to make nonblocking helpers resilient against driver
bugs, by having timeouts everywhere. And that worked too.

Unfortunately taking boths things together results in oopses :( Well,
at least sometimes: What seems to happen is that the drm event hangs
around forever stuck in limbo land. The nonblocking helpers eventually
time out, move on and release it. Now the bug I tested all this
against is drivers that just entirely fail to deliver the vblank
events like they should, and in those cases the event is simply
leaked. But what seems to happen, at least sometimes, on i915 is that
the event is set up correctly, but somohow the vblank fails to fire in
time. Which means the event isn't leaked, it's still there waiting for
eventually a vblank to fire. That tends to happen when re-enabling the
pipe, and then the trap springs and the kernel oopses.

The correct fix here is simply to refcount the crtc commit to make
sure that the event sticks around even for drivers which only
sometimes fail to deliver vblanks for some arbitrary reasons. Since
crtc commits are already refcounted that's easy to do.
