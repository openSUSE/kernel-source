Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: Don't call intel_prepare_page_flip() multiple times on gen2-4

References: bnc#911835

The flip stall detector kicks in when pending>=INTEL_FLIP_COMPLETE. That
means if we first call intel_prepare_page_flip() but don't call
intel_finish_page_flip(), the next stall check will erroneosly think
the page flip was somehow stuck.

With enough debug spew emitted from the interrupt handler my 830 hangs
when this happens. My theory is that the previous vblank interrupt gets
sufficiently delayed that the handler will see the pending bit set in
IIR, but ISR still has the bit set as well (ie. the flip was processed
by CS but didn't complete yet). In this case the handler will proceed
to call intel_check_page_flip() immediately after
intel_prepare_page_flip(). It then tries to print a backtrace for the
stuck flip WARN, which apparetly results in way too much debug spew
delaying interrupt processing further. That then seems to cause an
endless loop in the interrupt handler, and the machine is dead until
the watchdog kicks in and reboots. At least limiting the number of
iterations of the loop in the interrupt handler also prevented the
hang.

So it seems better to not call intel_prepare_page_flip() without
immediately calling intel_finish_page_flip(). The IIR/ISR trickery
avoids races here so this is a perfectly safe thing to do.
