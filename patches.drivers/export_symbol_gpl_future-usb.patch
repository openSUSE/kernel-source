From: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@suse.de>
Subject: [PATCH] add EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL_FUTURE() to USB subsystem
Patch-mainline: 2.6.17

The USB core symbols will be converted to GPL-only in a few years.  Mark
this as such and update the documentation explaining why, and provide a
pointer for developers to receive help if they need it.

+What:	USB driver API moves to EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL
+When:	Febuary 2008
+Files:	include/linux/usb.h, drivers/usb/core/driver.c
+Why:	The USB subsystem has changed a lot over time, and it has been
+	possible to create userspace USB drivers using usbfs/libusb/gadgetfs
+	that operate as fast as the USB bus allows.  Because of this, the USB
+	subsystem will not be allowing closed source kernel drivers to
+	register with it, after this grace period is over.  If anyone needs
+	any help in converting their closed source drivers over to use the
+	userspace filesystems, please contact the
+	linux-usb-devel@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list, and the developers
+	there will be glad to help you out.
