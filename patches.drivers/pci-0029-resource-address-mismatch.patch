Yes. However, it's pretty clear that the e820 entries are there for a
reason. Probably they are a hack by the BIOS maintainers to keep Windows
from stomping/moving that region, exactly because they want to keep the
bridge where it is (or, it's actually for the BIOS itself - the BIOS
tables are a horrid mess, and BIOS engineers are pretty hacky people:
they'll add random entries to make their own broken algorithms do the
"right thing").

I think we could (and probably should) solve this another way: consider
the ACPI "reserved regions" from the e820 map exactly the same way that we
do other ACPI hints - they should restrict _new_ allocations, but not
impact stuff we figure out on our own.

Basically, right now we assign _unassigned_ resources at "fs_initcall"
time. If we were to add in the e820 "reserved region" stuff before that
(but after we've done PCI discovery), we'd probably do the right thing.

Right now we do the e820 reserved regions very early indeed: we call
"register_memory()" from setup_arch(). We could move at least part of it
(the part that registers the resources) down a bit.

Here's a test-patch. I'm not saying we should absolutely do this, but it
might be interesting to try...
