Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda - Disable 64bit address for Creative HDA controllers
Git-commit: cadd16ea33a938d49aee99edd4758cc76048b399
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tiwai/sound.git
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
References: bnc#814440

We've had many reports that some Creative sound cards with CA0132
don't work well.  Some reported that it starts working after reloading
the module, while some reported it starts working when a 32bit kernel
is used.  All these facts seem implying that the chip fails to
communicate when the buffer is located in 64bit address.

This patch addresses these issues by just adding AZX_DCAPS_NO_64BIT
flag to the corresponding PCI entries.  I casually had a chance to
test an SB Recon3D board, and indeed this seems helping.

Although this hasn't been tested on all Creative devices, it's safer
to assume that this restriction applies to the rest of them, too.  So
the flag is applied to all Creative entries.
