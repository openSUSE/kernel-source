Subject: Kernel message catalog.
Patch-mainline: Probably never
References: bnc#549193,FATE#306999,LTC#57210
Patch-mainline: not yet

Description: 	Add support for automatic message tags to the printk macro
                families dev_xyz and pr_xyz. The message tag consists of a
                component name and a 24 bit hash of the message text. For
                each message that is documented in the included kernel message
                catalog a man page can be created with a script (which is
                included in the patch). The generated man pages contain
                explanatory text that is intended to help understand the
                messages.

                Note that only s390 specific messages are prepared
                appropriately and included in the generated message catalog.

                This patch is optional as it is very unlikely to be accepted
                in upstream kernel, but is recommended for all distributions
                which are built based on the 'Development stream'
