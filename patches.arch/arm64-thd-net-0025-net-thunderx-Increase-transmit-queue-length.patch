Subject: [PATCH 15/23] net: thunderx: Increase transmit queue length
Patch-mainline: Not yet, needs submission

Under high transmit rates and with TSO enabled observing fluctuations
in TX performance. Seen especially with iperf3 application.

Since TSO is taken care at driver level, with 64KB of TSO packets
and when window size is also high the rate at which CPU fills in
transmit descriptors is much higher than what HW is able to process.
Each 64KB TSO packet occupies gets segmented to ~43 1500 byte MTU packets
and occupies ~130 descriptors. Hence increasing transmit queue size.
