Subject: [PATCH v2 4/5] arm64/efi: ignore DT memory nodes instead of removing them
Date: Wed, 26 Aug 2015 10:06:30 +0200
Patch-mainline: Submitted, http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.efi/6148

There are two problems with the UEFI stub DT memory node removal
routine:
- it deletes nodes as it traverses the tree, which happens to work
  but is not supported, as deletion invalidates the node iterator;
- deleting memory nodes entirely may discard annotations in the form
  of additional properties on the nodes.

Now that the UEFI initialization has moved to an earlier stage, we can
actually just ignore any memblocks that are installed after we have
processed the UEFI memory map. This way, it is no longer necessary to
remove the nodes, so we can remove that logic from the stub as well.
