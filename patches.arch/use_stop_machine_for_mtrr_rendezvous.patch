Subject: x86, mtrr: use stop_machine APIs for doing MTRR rendezvous
Git-commit: 192d8857427dd23707d5f0b86ca990c3af6f2d74
Patch-mainline: v3.1-rc1
References: bnc#697859

MTRR rendezvous sequence is not implemened using stop_machine() before, as this
gets called both from the process context aswell as the cpu online paths
(where the cpu has not come online and the interrupts are disabled etc).

Now that we have a new stop_machine_from_inactive_cpu() API, use it for
rendezvous during mtrr init of a logical processor that is coming online.

For the rest (runtime MTRR modification, system boot, resume paths), use
stop_machine() to implement the rendezvous sequence. This will consolidate and
cleanup the code.
