Subject: Fix Thinkpad A21m shutdown
Patch-mainline: not yet, will repost
References: 150851

The A21m Thinkpad (maybe also others) have a GDCK method and a DOCK device.
It seems that on others machines the GDCK is the docking device.
Installing the notify handler for a GDCK device fails.
When module is unloaded it is tried to remove the never installed
notify handler for the GDCK method which seems to freeze the machine.

Fix: Do not set notify_installed when installing the notify handler fails.
