Subject: Fix spinning in spufs_ps_fault on signal
From: Jeremy Kerr <jk@ozlabs.org>
References: 447133 - LTC50070

Currently, we can end up in an infinite loop if we get a signal
while the kernel has faulted in spufs_ps_fault. Eg:

 alarm(1);

 write(fd, some_spu_psmap_register_address, 4);

- the write's copy_from_user will fault on the ps mapping, and
signal_pending will be non-zero. Because returning from the fault
handler will never clear TIF_SIGPENDING, so we'll just keep faulting,
resulting in an unkillable process using 100% of CPU.

This change returns VM_FAULT_SIGBUS if there's a fatal signal pending,
letting us escape the loop.
