Subject: [PATCH 24/26] net: mdio-octeon: Quit using readq_relaxed/writeq_relaxed
Patch-mainline: Not yet, Cavium has to do so
Reference: fate#319484

On early versions of the ThunderX SoCs, readq_relaxed/writeq_relaxed
had the property of ensuring that reads and writes were properly
ordered, but were higher performance that readq/writeq.  The ordering
is no longer guaranteed, and since MDIO buses do not require the very
highest performance register access, the safest thing to do is just
use normal readq/writeq.  So, do that.
