Subject: [PATCH] i386 kdump timer vector lockup fix
Acked-by: ak@suse.de
Patch-mainline: 2.6.17

Porting the patch I posted for x86_64 to i386.

http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=114178139610707&w=2



o While using kdump, after a system crash when second kernel boots, timer
  vector gets (0x31) locked and CPU does not see timer interrupts
  travelling from IOAPIC to APIC. Currently it does not lead to boot
  failure in second kernel as timer interrupts continues to come as ExtInt
  through LAPIC directly, but fixing it is good in case some boards do
  not support the other mode. 

o After a system crash, it is not safe to service interrupts any more, hence
  interrupts are disabled. This leads to pending interrupts at LAPIC. LAPIC
  sends these interrupts to the CPU during early boot of second kernel. Other
  pending interrupts are discarded saying unexpected trap but timer interrupt
  is serviced and CPU does not issue an LAPIC EOI because it think this
  interrupt came from i8259 and sends ack to 8259. This leads to vector 0x31
  locking as LAPIC does not clear respective ISR and keeps on waiting for
  EOI.

o This patch issues extra EOI for the pending interrupts who have ISR set.

o Though today only timer seems to be the special case because in early
  boot it thinks interrupts are coming from i8259 and uses
  mask_and_ack_8259A() as ack handler and does not issue LAPIC EOI. But
  probably doing it in generic manner for all vectors makes sense.
