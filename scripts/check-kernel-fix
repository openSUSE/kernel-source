Check state of a kernel fix and eventually suggest needed actions

Expect upstream kernel tree sha or CVE number as the parameter.
The script checks whether the commit is already in the upstream
baseline or backported in kernel-source tree.
Requires LINUX_GIT pointing to Linus git tree clone.

If backported, checks for CVE/bsc references and recommends adding these
if they are missing. (Requires VULNS_GIT pointing to
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/security/vulns.git tree.
This will also allow cve number instead of sha and it resolves proer
upstream commit automatically.

Also the script looks for \"Fixes:\" tag of the given \"sha\".
When defined, the script informs where the fix has to be backported.

The script also takes into account the hierarchy of branches.
It checks all branches. But the action is proposed only for
the top level ones. The assumption is that the other branches
will get the fix via a merge.

If the patch has CVE number with CVSS score associated then limits
actions only to CVSS affected branches.

Usage: ${0##*/} [options] sha|CVE [branch(es)]

Parameters:
	sha: sha of the upstream commit
	cve: CVE-XXXX-YYYY of the upstream commit (requires VULNS_GIT)
	branch: kernel branch(es) to check.

Options:
	-h: help
	-v: verbose mode: show state of each branch and even NOP actions
	-r: refresh any cached data. Use if cve->sha or cve->cvss fails
	    (git pull VULNS_GIT, cve, bsc medata)
	-t: flat mode. Similar to -v but it filters output to a summary for
	   product branches only without any additional information. Useful
	   for a short summary when handing over to the security team.
	-s CVSS: override the CVSS score if known. This can be useful when
	   the CVE->CVSS DB is not synced yet.
	-b bsc#NUMBER: override the bugzilla number if known
	-f sha: provide explicit Fixes tag. Use when the one in the commit is
	   unknown but you could figure it from the code inspection.
	   Specify repeteadly if more are required
	-F: treat -f sha provided fixes as authoritative and override those
	   in the commit. Use this if Fixes: tags in the commit are incorrect
	   or if you want to enforce run without a known fixes tag.
	-c CVE-XXXX-YYYY: provide CVE number for the given sha. Use for
	   CVEs issued before the process has changed and VULNS_GIT doesn't
	   recognize this CVE
	-n Do not print maintainers candidates.
