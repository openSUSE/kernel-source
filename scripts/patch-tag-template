# Here all the valid metadata tags for suse patches are recorded.  Patches
# in the SUSE kernel repository must have a Subject tag, and there must
# be a suse or novell email address in a From:, Signed-off-by: or Acked-by:
# tag.

# Every patch in the SUSE repository must have a descriptive comment in
# addition to any tags present
#

# Patch-mainline indicates which version of Linus' kernel includes the patch.

# These are used by scripts to check on the status of patches in the 
# repository, reminding us to send them into mainline.
#
# "never" indicates the patch will never be sent to mainline.  A short 
# explanation should follow
