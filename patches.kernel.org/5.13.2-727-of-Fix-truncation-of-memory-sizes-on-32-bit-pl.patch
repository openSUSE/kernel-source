Subject: [PATCH] of: Fix truncation of memory sizes on 32-bit platforms
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.2
Git-commit: 2892d8a00d23d511a0591ac4b2ff3f050ae1f004

[ Upstream commit 2892d8a00d23d511a0591ac4b2ff3f050ae1f004 ]

Variable "size" has type "phys_addr_t", which can be either 32-bit or
64-bit on 32-bit systems, while "unsigned long" is always 32-bit on
32-bit systems.  Hence the cast in

    (unsigned long)size / SZ_1M

may truncate a 64-bit size to 32-bit, as casts have a higher operator
precedence than divisions.

Fix this by inverting the order of the cast and division, which should
be safe for memory blocks smaller than 4 PiB.  Note that the division is
actually a shift, as SZ_1M is a power-of-two constant, hence there is no
need to use div_u64().

While at it, use "%lu" to format "unsigned long".
