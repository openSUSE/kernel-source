Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sc7280: Fix up GPU SIDs
References: bsc#1218052
Patch-mainline: 6.1.75
Git-commit: 94085049fdad7a36fe14dd55e72e712fe55d6bca

[ Upstream commit 94085049fdad7a36fe14dd55e72e712fe55d6bca ]

GPU_SMMU SID 1 is meant for Adreno LPAC (Low Priority Async Compute).
On platforms that support it (in firmware), it is necessary to
describe that link, or Adreno register access will hang the board.

The current settings are functionally identical, *but* due to what is
likely hardcoded security policies, the secure firmware rejects them,
resulting in the board hanging. To avoid that, alter the settings such
that SID 0 and 1 are described separately.
