Subject: [PATCH] wifi: mac80211: don't perform DA check on S1G beacon
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.8
Git-commit: 5dc6975566f5d142ec53eb7e97af688c45dd314d

[ Upstream commit 5dc6975566f5d142ec53eb7e97af688c45dd314d ]

S1G beacons don't contain the DA field as per IEEE80211-2024 9.3.4.3,
so the DA broadcast check reads the SA address of the S1G beacon which
will subsequently lead to the beacon being dropped. As a result, passive
scanning is not possible. Fix this by only performing the check on
non-S1G beacons to allow S1G long beacons to be processed during a
passive scan.

Fixes: ddf82e752f8a ("wifi: mac80211: Allow beacons to update BSS table regardless of scan")
