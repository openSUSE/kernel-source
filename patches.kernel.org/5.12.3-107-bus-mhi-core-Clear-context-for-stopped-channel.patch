Subject: [PATCH] bus: mhi: core: Clear context for stopped channels from
 remove()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.3
Git-commit: 4e44ae3d6d9c2c2a6d9356dd279c925532d5cd8c

[ Upstream commit 4e44ae3d6d9c2c2a6d9356dd279c925532d5cd8c ]

If a channel was explicitly stopped but not reset and a driver
remove is issued, clean up the channel context such that it is
reflected on the device. This move is useful if a client driver
module is unloaded or a device crash occurs with the host having
placed the channel in a stopped state.
