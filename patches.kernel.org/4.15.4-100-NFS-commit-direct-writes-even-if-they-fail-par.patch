Subject: [PATCH] NFS: commit direct writes even if they fail partially
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.4
Git-commit: 1b8d97b0a837beaf48a8449955b52c650a7114b4

commit 1b8d97b0a837beaf48a8449955b52c650a7114b4 upstream.

If some of the WRITE calls making up an O_DIRECT write syscall fail,
we neglect to commit, even if some of the WRITEs succeed.

We also depend on the commit code to free the reference count on the
nfs_page taken in the "if (request_commit)" case at the end of
nfs_direct_write_completion().  The problem was originally noticed
because ENOSPC's encountered partway through a write would result in a
closed file being sillyrenamed when it should have been unlinked.
