Subject: [PATCH] ARC: entry: fix off-by-one error in syscall number validation
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.5
Git-commit: 3433adc8bd09fc9f29b8baddf33b4ecd1ecd2cdc

commit 3433adc8bd09fc9f29b8baddf33b4ecd1ecd2cdc upstream.

We have NR_syscall syscalls from [0 .. NR_syscall-1].
However the check for invalid syscall number is "> NR_syscall" as
opposed to >=. This off-by-one error erronesously allows "NR_syscall"
to be treated as valid syscall causeing out-of-bounds access into
syscall-call table ensuing a crash (holes within syscall table have a
invalid-entry handler but this is beyond the array implementing the
table).

This problem showed up on v5.6 kernel when testing glibc 2.33 (v5.10
kernel capable, includng faccessat2 syscall 439). The v5.6 kernel has
NR_syscalls=439 (0 to 438). Due to the bug, 439 passed by glibc was
not handled as -ENOSYS but processed leading to a crash.
