Subject: [PATCH] watchdog: gpio_wdt: set WDOG_HW_RUNNING in gpio_wdt_stop
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.4
Git-commit: bc137dfdbec27c0ec5731a89002daded4a4aa1ea

commit bc137dfdbec27c0ec5731a89002daded4a4aa1ea upstream.

The first patch above (https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9970181/)
makes the oops go away, but it just papers over the problem. The real
problem is that the watchdog core clears WDOG_HW_RUNNING in
watchdog_stop, and the gpio driver fails to set it in its stop
function when it doesn't actually stop it. This means that the core
doesn't know that it now has responsibility for petting the device, in
turn causing the device to reset the system (I hadn't noticed this
because the board I'm working on has that reset logic disabled).

How about this (other drivers may of course have the same problem, I
haven't checked). One might say that ->stop should return an error
when the device can't be stopped, but OTOH this brings parity between
a device without a ->stop method and a GPIO wd that has always-running
set. IOW, I think ->stop should only return an error when an actual
attempt to stop the hardware failed.

From: Rasmus Villemoes <rasmus.villemoes@prevas.dk>

The watchdog framework clears WDOG_HW_RUNNING before calling
->stop. If the driver is unable to stop the device, it is supposed to
set that bit again so that the watchdog core takes care of sending
heart-beats while the device is not open from user-space. Update the
gpio_wdt driver to honour that contract (and get rid of the redundant
clearing of WDOG_HW_RUNNING).
