Subject: [PATCH] jbd2: fix sphinx kernel-doc build warnings
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.5
Git-commit: f69120ce6c024aa634a8fc25787205e42f0ccbe6

commit f69120ce6c024aa634a8fc25787205e42f0ccbe6 upstream.

Sphinx emits various (26) warnings when building make target 'htmldocs'.
Currently struct definitions contain duplicate documentation, some as
kernel-docs and some as standard c89 comments.  We can reduce
duplication while cleaning up the kernel docs.

Move all kernel-docs to right above each struct member.  Use the set of
all existing comments (kernel-doc and c89).  Add documentation for
missing struct members and function arguments.
