Subject: [PATCH] signalfd: use wake_up_pollfree()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.8
Git-commit: 9537bae0da1f8d1e2361ab6d0479e8af7824e160

commit 9537bae0da1f8d1e2361ab6d0479e8af7824e160 upstream.

wake_up_poll() uses nr_exclusive=1, so it's not guaranteed to wake up
all exclusive waiters.  Yet, POLLFREE *must* wake up all waiters.  epoll
and aio poll are fortunately not affected by this, but it's very
fragile.  Thus, the new function wake_up_pollfree() has been introduced.

Convert signalfd to use wake_up_pollfree().
