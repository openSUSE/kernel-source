Subject: [PATCH] ata: libata-core: Introduce ata_dev_config_lpm()
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.68
Git-commit: d360121832d8a36871249271df5b9ff05f835f62

[ Upstream commit d360121832d8a36871249271df5b9ff05f835f62 ]

If the port of a device does not support Device Initiated Power
Management (DIPM), that is, the port is flagged with ATA_FLAG_NO_DIPM,
the DIPM feature of a device should not be used. Though DIPM is disabled
by default on a device, the "Software Settings Preservation feature"
may keep DIPM enabled or DIPM may have been enabled by the system
firmware.

Introduce the function ata_dev_config_lpm() to always disable DIPM on a
device that supports this feature if the port of the device is flagged
with ATA_FLAG_NO_DIPM. ata_dev_config_lpm() is called from
ata_dev_configure(), ensuring that a device DIPM feature is disabled
when it cannot be used.
