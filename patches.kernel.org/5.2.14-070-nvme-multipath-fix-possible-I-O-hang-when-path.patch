Subject: [PATCH] nvme-multipath: fix possible I/O hang when paths are updated
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.14
Git-commit: 504db087aaccdb32af61539916409f7dca31ceb5

[ Upstream commit 504db087aaccdb32af61539916409f7dca31ceb5 ]

nvme_state_set_live() making a path available triggers requeue_work
in order to resubmit requests that ended up on requeue_list when no
paths were available.

This requeue_work may race with concurrent nvme_ns_head_make_request()
that do not observe the live path yet.
Such concurrent requests may by made by either:
- New IO submission.
- Requeue_work triggered by nvme_failover_req() or another ana_work.

A race may cause requeue_work capture the state of requeue_list before
more requests get onto the list. These requests will stay on the list
forever unless requeue_work is triggered again.

In order to prevent such race, nvme_state_set_live() should
synchronize_srcu(&head->srcu) before triggering the requeue_work and
prevent nvme_ns_head_make_request referencing an old snapshot of the
path list.
