Subject: [PATCH] tty: n_gsm: fix wrong signal octet encoding in convergence
 layer type 2
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.6
Git-commit: 06d5afd4d640eea67f5623e76cd5fc03359b7f3c

commit 06d5afd4d640eea67f5623e76cd5fc03359b7f3c upstream.

n_gsm is based on the 3GPP 07.010 and its newer version is the 3GPP 27.010.
See https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=1516
The changes from 07.010 to 27.010 are non-functional. Therefore, I refer to
the newer 27.010 here. Chapter 5.5.2 describes that the signal octet in
convergence layer type 2 can be either one or two bytes. The length is
encoded in the EA bit. This is set 1 for the last byte in the sequence.
gsmtty_modem_update() handles this correctly but gsm_dlci_data_output()
fails to set EA to 1. There is no case in which we encode two signal octets
as there is no case in which we send out a break signal.
Therefore, always set the EA bit to 1 for the signal octet to fix this.
