Subject: [PATCH] selftests: net: use BASH for bareudp testing
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.60
Git-commit: 9311e9540a8b406d9f028aa87fb072a3819d4c82

[ Upstream commit 9311e9540a8b406d9f028aa87fb072a3819d4c82 ]

In bareudp.sh, this script uses /bin/sh and it will load another lib.sh
BASH script at the very beginning.

But on some operating systems like Ubuntu, /bin/sh is actually pointed to
DASH, thus it will try to run BASH commands with DASH and consequently
leads to syntax issues:
  # ./bareudp.sh: 4: ./lib.sh: Bad substitution
  # ./bareudp.sh: 5: ./lib.sh: source: not found
  # ./bareudp.sh: 24: ./lib.sh: Syntax error: "(" unexpected

Fix this by explicitly using BASH for bareudp.sh. This fixes test
execution failures on systems where /bin/sh is not BASH.
