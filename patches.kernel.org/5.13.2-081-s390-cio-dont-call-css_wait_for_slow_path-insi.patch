Subject: [PATCH] s390/cio: dont call css_wait_for_slow_path() inside a lock
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.2
Git-commit: c749d8c018daf5fba6dfac7b6c5c78b27efd7d65

commit c749d8c018daf5fba6dfac7b6c5c78b27efd7d65 upstream.

Currently css_wait_for_slow_path() gets called inside the chp->lock.
The path-verification-loop of slowpath inside this lock could lead to
deadlock as reported by the lockdep validator.

The ccw_device_get_chp_desc() during the instance of a device-set-online
would try to acquire the same 'chp->lock' to read the chp->desc.
The instance of this function can get called from multiple scenario,
like probing or setting-device online manually. This could, in some
corner-cases lead to the deadlock.

lockdep validator reported this as,

        CPU0                    CPU1
        ----                    ----
   lock(&chp->lock);
                                lock(kn->active#43);
                                lock(&chp->lock);
   lock((wq_completion)cio);

The chp->lock was introduced to serialize the access of struct
channel_path. This lock is not needed for the css_wait_for_slow_path()
function, so invoke the slow-path function outside this lock.
