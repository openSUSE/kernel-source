Subject: [PATCH] minix: fix bug when opening a file with O_DIRECT
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.3
Git-commit: 9ce3c0d26c42d279b6c378a03cd6a61d828f19ca

[ Upstream commit 9ce3c0d26c42d279b6c378a03cd6a61d828f19ca ]

Testcase:
1. create a minix file system and mount it
2. open a file on the file system with O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC|O_DIRECT
3. open fails with -EINVAL but leaves an empty file behind. All other
   open() failures don't leave the failed open files behind.

It is hard to check the direct_IO op before creating the inode.  Just as
ext4 and btrfs do, this patch will resolve the issue by allowing to
create the file with O_DIRECT but returning error when writing the file.
