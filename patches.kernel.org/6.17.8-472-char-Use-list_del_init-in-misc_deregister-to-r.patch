Subject: [PATCH] char: Use list_del_init() in misc_deregister() to
 reinitialize list pointer
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.8
Git-commit: e28022873c0d051e980c4145f1965cab5504b498

[ Upstream commit e28022873c0d051e980c4145f1965cab5504b498 ]

Currently, misc_deregister() uses list_del() to remove the device
from the list. After list_del(), the list pointers are set to
LIST_POISON1 and LIST_POISON2, which may help catch use-after-free bugs,
but does not reset the list head.
If misc_deregister() is called more than once on the same device,
list_empty() will not return true, and list_del() may be called again,
leading to undefined behavior.

Replace list_del() with list_del_init() to reinitialize the list head
after deletion. This makes the code more robust against double
deregistration and allows safe usage of list_empty() on the miscdevice
after deregistration.

[ Note, this seems to keep broken out-of-tree drivers from doing foolish
  things.  While this does not matter for any in-kernel drivers,
  external drivers could use a bit of help to show them they shouldn't
  be doing stuff like re-registering misc devices - gregkh ]
