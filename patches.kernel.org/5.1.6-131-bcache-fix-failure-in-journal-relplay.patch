Subject: [PATCH] bcache: fix failure in journal relplay
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.6
Git-commit: 631207314d88e9091be02fbdd1fdadb1ae2ed79a

[ Upstream commit 631207314d88e9091be02fbdd1fdadb1ae2ed79a ]

journal replay failed with messages:
Sep 10 19:10:43 ceph kernel: bcache: error on
bb379a64-e44e-4812-b91d-a5599871a3b1: bcache: journal entries
2057493-2057567 missing! (replaying 2057493-2076601), disabling
caching

The reason is in journal_reclaim(), when discard is enabled, we send
discard command and reclaim those journal buckets whose seq is old
than the last_seq_now, but before we write a journal with last_seq_now,
the machine is restarted, so the journal with the last_seq_now is not
written to the journal bucket, and the last_seq_wrote in the newest
journal is old than last_seq_now which we expect to be, so when we doing
replay, journals from last_seq_wrote to last_seq_now are missing.

It's hard to write a journal immediately after journal_reclaim(),
and it harmless if those missed journal are caused by discarding
since those journals are already wrote to btree node. So, if miss
seqs are started from the beginning journal, we treat it as normal,
and only print a message to show the miss journal, and point out
it maybe caused by discarding.

Patch v2 add a judgement condition to ignore the missed journal
only when discard enabled as Coly suggested.

(Coly Li: rebase the patch with other changes in bch_journal_replay())
