Subject: [PATCH] crypto: skcipher - set walk.iv for zero-length inputs
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.10
Git-commit: 2b4f27c36bcd46e820ddb9a8e6fe6a63fa4250b8

commit 2b4f27c36bcd46e820ddb9a8e6fe6a63fa4250b8 upstream.

All the ChaCha20 algorithms as well as the ARM bit-sliced AES-XTS
algorithms call skcipher_walk_virt(), then access the IV (walk.iv)
before checking whether any bytes need to be processed (walk.nbytes).

But if the input is empty, then skcipher_walk_virt() doesn't set the IV,
and the algorithms crash trying to use the uninitialized IV pointer.

Fix it by setting the IV earlier in skcipher_walk_virt().  Also fix it
for the AEAD walk functions.

This isn't a perfect solution because we can't actually align the IV to
->cra_alignmask unless there are bytes to process, for one because the
temporary buffer for the aligned IV is freed by skcipher_walk_done(),
which is only called when there are bytes to process.  Thus, algorithms
that require aligned IVs will still need to avoid accessing the IV when
walk.nbytes == 0.  Still, many algorithms/architectures are fine with
IVs having any alignment, and even for those that aren't, a misaligned
pointer bug is much less severe than an uninitialized pointer bug.

This change also matches the behavior of the older blkcipher_walk API.
