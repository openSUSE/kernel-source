Subject: [PATCH] selftests: icmp_redirect: pass xfail=0 to log_test()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.11
Git-commit: 3748939bce3fc7a15ef07161826507fbe410bb7a

[ Upstream commit 3748939bce3fc7a15ef07161826507fbe410bb7a ]

If any sub-test in this icmp_redirect.sh is failing but not expected
to fail. The script will complain:
    ./icmp_redirect.sh: line 72: [: 1: unary operator expected

This is because when the sub-test is not expected to fail, we won't
pass any value for the xfail local variable in log_test() and thus
it's empty. Fix this by passing 0 as the 4th variable to log_test()
for non-xfail cases.

v2: added fixes tag
