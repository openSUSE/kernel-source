Subject: [PATCH] usb: dwc2: Do not update data length if it is 0 on inbound
 transfers
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.3
Git-commit: 415fa1c7305dedbb345e2cc8ac91769bc1c83f1a

[ Upstream commit 415fa1c7305dedbb345e2cc8ac91769bc1c83f1a ]

The DWC2 documentation states that transfers with zero data length should
set the number of packets to 1 and the transfer length to 0. This is not
currently the case for inbound transfers: the transfer length is set to
the maximum packet length. This can have adverse effects if the chip
actually does transfer data as it is programmed to do. Follow chip
documentation and keep the transfer length set to 0 in that situation.
