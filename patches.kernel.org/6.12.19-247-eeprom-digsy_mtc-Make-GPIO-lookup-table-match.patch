Subject: [PATCH] eeprom: digsy_mtc: Make GPIO lookup table match the device
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.19
Git-commit: 038ef0754aae76f79b147b8867f9250e6a976872

commit 038ef0754aae76f79b147b8867f9250e6a976872 upstream.

The dev_id value in the GPIO lookup table must match to
the device instance name, which in this case is combined
of name and platform device ID, i.e. "spi_gpio.1". But
the table assumed that there was no platform device ID
defined, which is wrong. Fix the dev_id value accordingly.

Fixes: 9b00bc7b901f ("spi: spi-gpio: Rewrite to use GPIO descriptors")
