Subject: [PATCH] irqchip/gic-v3: Fix priority comparison when non-secure
 priorities are used
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.4
Git-commit: 8d474deaba2c4dd33a5e2f5be82e6798ffa6b8a5

[ Upstream commit 8d474deaba2c4dd33a5e2f5be82e6798ffa6b8a5 ]

When non-secure priorities are used, compared to the raw priority set,
the value read back from RPR is also right-shifted by one and the
highest bit set.

Add a macro to do the modifications to the raw priority when doing the
comparison against the RPR value. This corrects the pseudo-NMI behavior
when non-secure priorities in the GIC are used. Tested on 5.10 with
the "IPI as pseudo-NMI" series [1] applied on MT8195.
