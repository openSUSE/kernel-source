Subject: [PATCH] riscv: mm: fix regression due to update_mmu_cache change
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: b49f700668fff7565b945dce823def79bff59bb0

commit b49f700668fff7565b945dce823def79bff59bb0 upstream.

This is a partial revert of the commit 4bd1d80efb5a ("riscv: mm: notify
remote harts about mmu cache updates"). Original commit included two
loosely related changes serving the same purpose of fixing stale TLB
entries causing user-space application crash:
- introduce deferred per-ASID TLB flush for CPUs not running the task
- switch to per-ASID TLB flush on all CPUs running the task in update_mmu_cache

According to report and discussion in [1], the second part caused a
regression on Renesas RZ/Five SoC. For now restore the old behavior
of the update_mmu_cache.
