Subject: [PATCH] drivers: nvmem: Fix voltage settings for QTI qfprom-efuse
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.4
Git-commit: 9ec4f4b0e9fd3ad4b9a38bddb75b516ea09f4628

[ Upstream commit 9ec4f4b0e9fd3ad4b9a38bddb75b516ea09f4628 ]

QFPROM controller hardware requires 1.8V min for fuse blowing.
So, this change sets the voltage to 1.8V, required to blow the fuse
for qfprom-efuse controller.

To disable fuse blowing, we set the voltage to 0V since this may
be a shared rail and may be able to run at a lower rate when we're
not blowing fuses.
