Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: exynos: correct MUIC interrupt trigger level on
 Midas family
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.4
Git-commit: 15107e443ab8c6cb35eff10438993e4bc944d9ae

[ Upstream commit 15107e443ab8c6cb35eff10438993e4bc944d9ae ]

The Maxim MUIC datasheets describe the interrupt line as active low
with a requirement of acknowledge from the CPU.  Without specifying the
interrupt type in Devicetree, kernel might apply some fixed
configuration, not necessarily working for this hardware.

Additionally, the interrupt line is shared so using level sensitive
interrupt is here especially important to avoid races.
