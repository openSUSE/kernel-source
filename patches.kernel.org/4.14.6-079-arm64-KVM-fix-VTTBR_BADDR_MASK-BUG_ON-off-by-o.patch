Subject: [PATCH] arm64: KVM: fix VTTBR_BADDR_MASK BUG_ON off-by-one
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.6
Git-commit: 26aa7b3b1c0fb3f1a6176a0c1847204ef4355693

commit 26aa7b3b1c0fb3f1a6176a0c1847204ef4355693 upstream.

VTTBR_BADDR_MASK is used to sanity check the size and alignment of the
VTTBR address. It seems to currently be off by one, thereby only
allowing up to 47-bit addresses (instead of 48-bit) and also
insufficiently checking the alignment. This patch fixes it.

As an example, with 4k pages, before this patch we have:

  PHYS_MASK_SHIFT = 48
  VTTBR_X = 37 - 24 = 13
  VTTBR_BADDR_SHIFT = 13 - 1 = 12
  VTTBR_BADDR_MASK = ((1 << 35) - 1) << 12 = 0x00007ffffffff000

Which is wrong, because the mask doesn't allow bit 47 of the VTTBR
address to be set, and only requires the address to be 12-bit (4k)
aligned, while it actually needs to be 13-bit (8k) aligned because we
concatenate two 4k tables.

With this patch, the mask becomes 0x0000ffffffffe000, which is what we
want.
