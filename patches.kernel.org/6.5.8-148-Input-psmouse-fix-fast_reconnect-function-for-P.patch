Subject: [PATCH] Input: psmouse - fix fast_reconnect function for PS/2 mode
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.8
Git-commit: e2cb5cc822b6c9ee72c56ce1d81671b22c05406a

commit e2cb5cc822b6c9ee72c56ce1d81671b22c05406a upstream.

When the SMBus connection is attempted psmouse_smbus_init() sets
the fast_reconnect pointer to psmouse_smbus_reconnecti(). If SMBus
initialization fails, elantech_setup_ps2() and synaptics_init_ps2() will
fallback to PS/2 mode, replacing the psmouse private data. This can cause
issues on resume, since psmouse_smbus_reconnect() expects to find an
instance of struct psmouse_smbus_dev in psmouse->private.

The issue was uncovered when in 92e24e0e57f7 ("Input: psmouse - add
delay when deactivating for SMBus mode") psmouse_smbus_reconnect()
started attempting to use more of the data structure. The commit was
since reverted, not because it was at fault, but because there was found
a better way of doing what it was attempting to do.

Fix the problem by resetting the fast_reconnect pointer in psmouse
structure in elantech_setup_ps2() and synaptics_init_ps2() when the PS/2
mode is used.
