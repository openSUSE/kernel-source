Subject: [PATCH] KVM: nVMX: Intercept VMWRITEs to GUEST_{CS,SS}_AR_BYTES
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.5
Git-commit: b643780562af5378ef7fe731c65b8f93e49c59c6

[ Upstream commit b643780562af5378ef7fe731c65b8f93e49c59c6 ]

VMMs frequently read the guest's CS and SS AR bytes to detect 64-bit
mode and CPL respectively, but effectively never write said fields once
the VM is initialized.  Intercepting VMWRITEs for the two fields saves
~55 cycles in copy_shadow_to_vmcs12().

Because some Intel CPUs, e.g. Haswell, drop the reserved bits of the
guest access rights fields on VMWRITE, exposing the fields to L1 for
VMREAD but not VMWRITE leads to inconsistent behavior between L1 and L2.
On hardware that drops the bits, L1 will see the stripped down value due
to reading the value from hardware, while L2 will see the full original
value as stored by KVM.  To avoid such an inconsistency, emulate the
behavior on all CPUS, but only for intercepted VMWRITEs so as to avoid
introducing pointless latency into copy_shadow_to_vmcs12(), e.g. if the
emulation were added to vmcs12_write_any().

Since the AR_BYTES emulation is done only for intercepted VMWRITE, if a
future patch (re)exposed AR_BYTES for both VMWRITE and VMREAD, then KVM
would end up with incosistent behavior on pre-Haswell hardware, e.g. KVM
would drop the reserved bits on intercepted VMWRITE, but direct VMWRITE
to the shadow VMCS would not drop the bits.  Add a WARN in the shadow
field initialization to detect any attempt to expose an AR_BYTES field
without updating vmcs12_write_any().

Note, emulation of the AR_BYTES reserved bit behavior is based on a
patch[1] from Jim Mattson that applied the emulation to all writes to
vmcs12 so that live migration across different generations of hardware
would not introduce divergent behavior.  But given that live migration
of nested state has already been enabled, that ship has sailed (not to
mention that no sane VMM will be affected by this behavior).
