Subject: [PATCH] tracing: Add NULL checks for buffer in
 ring_buffer_free_read_page()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.18
Git-commit: 3e4272b9954094907f16861199728f14002fcaf6

[ Upstream commit 3e4272b9954094907f16861199728f14002fcaf6 ]

In a previous commit 7433632c9ff6, buffer, buffer->buffers and
buffer->buffers[cpu] in ring_buffer_wake_waiters() can be NULL,
and thus the related checks are added.

However, in the same call stack, these variables are also used in
ring_buffer_free_read_page():

tracing_buffers_release()
  ring_buffer_wake_waiters(iter->array_buffer->buffer)
    cpu_buffer = buffer->buffers[cpu] -> Add checks by previous commit
  ring_buffer_free_read_page(iter->array_buffer->buffer)
    cpu_buffer = buffer->buffers[cpu] -> No check

Thus, to avod possible null-pointer derefernces, the related checks
should be added.

These results are reported by a static tool designed by myself.
