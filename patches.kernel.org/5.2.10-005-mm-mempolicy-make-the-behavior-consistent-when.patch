Subject: [PATCH] mm: mempolicy: make the behavior consistent when
 MPOL_MF_MOVE* and MPOL_MF_STRICT were specified
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.10
Git-commit: d883544515aae54842c21730b880172e7894fde9

commit d883544515aae54842c21730b880172e7894fde9 upstream.

When both MPOL_MF_MOVE* and MPOL_MF_STRICT was specified, mbind() should
try best to migrate misplaced pages, if some of the pages could not be
migrated, then return -EIO.

There are three different sub-cases:
 1. vma is not migratable
 2. vma is migratable, but there are unmovable pages
 3. vma is migratable, pages are movable, but migrate_pages() fails

If #1 happens, kernel would just abort immediately, then return -EIO,
after a7f40cfe3b7a ("mm: mempolicy: make mbind() return -EIO when
MPOL_MF_STRICT is specified").

If #3 happens, kernel would set policy and migrate pages with
best-effort, but won't rollback the migrated pages and reset the policy
back.

Before that commit, they behaves in the same way.  It'd better to keep
their behavior consistent.  But, rolling back the migrated pages and
resetting the policy back sounds not feasible, so just make #1 behave as
same as #3.

Userspace will know that not everything was successfully migrated (via
-EIO), and can take whatever steps it deems necessary - attempt
rollback, determine which exact page(s) are violating the policy, etc.

Make queue_pages_range() return 1 to indicate there are unmovable pages
or vma is not migratable.

The #2 is not handled correctly in the current kernel, the following
patch will fix it.
