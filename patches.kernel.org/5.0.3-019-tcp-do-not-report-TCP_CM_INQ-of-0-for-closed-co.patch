Subject: [PATCH] tcp: do not report TCP_CM_INQ of 0 for closed connections
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.3
Git-commit: 6466e715651f9f358e60c5ea4880e4731325827f

[ Upstream commit 6466e715651f9f358e60c5ea4880e4731325827f ]

Returning 0 as inq to userspace indicates there is no more data to
read, and the application needs to wait for EPOLLIN. For a connection
that has received FIN from the remote peer, however, the application
must continue reading until getting EOF (return value of 0
from tcp_recvmsg) or an error, if edge-triggered epoll (EPOLLET) is
being used. Otherwise, the application will never receive a new
EPOLLIN, since there is no epoll edge after the FIN.

Return 1 when there is no data left on the queue but the
connection has received FIN, so that the applications continue
reading.

Fixes: b75eba76d3d72 (tcp: send in-queue bytes in cmsg upon read)
