Subject: [PATCH] nvme-fc: clear q_live at beginning of association teardown
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.7
Git-commit: a7d139145a6640172516b193abf6d2398620aa14

[ Upstream commit a7d139145a6640172516b193abf6d2398620aa14 ]

The __nvmf_check_ready() routine used to bounce all filesystem io if the
controller state isn't LIVE.  However, a later patch changed the logic so
that it rejection ends up being based on the Q live check.  The FC
transport has a slightly different sequence from rdma and tcp for
shutting down queues/marking them non-live.  FC marks its queue non-live
after aborting all ios and waiting for their termination, leaving a
rather large window for filesystem io to continue to hit the transport.
Unfortunately this resulted in filesystem I/O or applications seeing I/O
errors.

Change the FC transport to mark the queues non-live at the first sign of
teardown for the association (when I/O is initially terminated).

Fixes: 73a5379937ec ("nvme-fabrics: allow to queue requests for live queues")
