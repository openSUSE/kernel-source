Subject: [PATCH] Revert 337f13046ff0 ("futex: Allow FUTEX_CLOCK_REALTIME with
 FUTEX_WAIT op")
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.3
Git-commit: 4fbf5d6837bf81fd7a27d771358f4ee6c4f243f8

commit 4fbf5d6837bf81fd7a27d771358f4ee6c4f243f8 upstream.

The FUTEX_WAIT operand has historically a relative timeout which means that
the clock id is irrelevant as relative timeouts on CLOCK_REALTIME are not
subject to wall clock changes and therefore are mapped by the kernel to
CLOCK_MONOTONIC for simplicity.

If a caller would set FUTEX_CLOCK_REALTIME for FUTEX_WAIT the timeout is
still treated relative vs. CLOCK_MONOTONIC and then the wait arms that
timeout based on CLOCK_REALTIME which is broken and obviously has never
been used or even tested.

Reject any attempt to use FUTEX_CLOCK_REALTIME with FUTEX_WAIT again.

The desired functionality can be achieved with FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET and a
FUTEX_BITSET_MATCH_ANY argument.
