Subject: [PATCH] blk-cgroup: Reinit blkg_iostat_set after clearing in
 blkcg_reset_stats()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.4.4
Git-commit: 3d2af77e31ade05ff7ccc3658c3635ec1bea0979

[ Upstream commit 3d2af77e31ade05ff7ccc3658c3635ec1bea0979 ]

When blkg_alloc() is called to allocate a blkcg_gq structure
with the associated blkg_iostat_set's, there are 2 fields within
blkg_iostat_set that requires proper initialization - blkg & sync.
The former field was introduced by commit 3b8cc6298724 ("blk-cgroup:
Optimize blkcg_rstat_flush()") while the later one was introduced by
commit f73316482977 ("blk-cgroup: reimplement basic IO stats using
cgroup rstat").

Unfortunately those fields in the blkg_iostat_set's are not properly
re-initialized when they are cleared in v1's blkcg_reset_stats(). This
can lead to a kernel panic due to NULL pointer access of the blkg
pointer. The missing initialization of sync is less problematic and
can be a problem in a debug kernel due to missing lockdep initialization.

Fix these problems by re-initializing them after memory clearing.

Fixes: 3b8cc6298724 ("blk-cgroup: Optimize blkcg_rstat_flush()")
Fixes: f73316482977 ("blk-cgroup: reimplement basic IO stats using cgroup rstat")
