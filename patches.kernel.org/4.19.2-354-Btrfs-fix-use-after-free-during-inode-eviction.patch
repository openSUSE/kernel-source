Subject: [PATCH] Btrfs: fix use-after-free during inode eviction
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.2
Git-commit: 421f0922a2cfb0c75acd9746454aaa576c711a65

commit 421f0922a2cfb0c75acd9746454aaa576c711a65 upstream.

At inode.c:evict_inode_truncate_pages(), when we iterate over the
inode's extent states, we access an extent state record's "state" field
after we unlocked the inode's io tree lock. This can lead to a
use-after-free issue because after we unlock the io tree that extent
state record might have been freed due to being merged into another
adjacent extent state record (a previous inflight bio for a read
operation finished in the meanwhile which unlocked a range in the io
tree and cause a merge of extent state records, as explained in the
comment before the while loop added in commit 6ca0709756710 ("Btrfs: fix
hang during inode eviction due to concurrent readahead")).

Fix this by keeping a copy of the extent state's flags in a local
variable and using it after unlocking the io tree.
