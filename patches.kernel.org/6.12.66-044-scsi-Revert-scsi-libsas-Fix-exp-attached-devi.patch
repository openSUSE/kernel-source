Subject: [PATCH] scsi: Revert "scsi: libsas: Fix exp-attached device scan
 after probe failure scanned in again after probe failed"
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.66
Git-commit: 278712d20bc8ec29d1ad6ef9bdae9000ef2c220c

[ Upstream commit 278712d20bc8ec29d1ad6ef9bdae9000ef2c220c ]

This reverts commit ab2068a6fb84751836a84c26ca72b3beb349619d.

When probing the exp-attached sata device, libsas/libata will issue a
hard reset in sas_probe_sata() -> ata_sas_async_probe(), then a
broadcast event will be received after the disk probe fails, and this
commit causes the probe will be re-executed on the disk, and a faulty
disk may get into an indefinite loop of probe.

Therefore, revert this commit, although it can fix some temporary issues
with disk probe failure.
