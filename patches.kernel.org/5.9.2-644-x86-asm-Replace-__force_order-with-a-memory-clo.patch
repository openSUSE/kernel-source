Subject: [PATCH] x86/asm: Replace __force_order with a memory clobber
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.2
Git-commit: aa5cacdc29d76a005cbbee018a47faa6e724dd2d

[ Upstream commit aa5cacdc29d76a005cbbee018a47faa6e724dd2d ]

The CRn accessor functions use __force_order as a dummy operand to
prevent the compiler from reordering CRn reads/writes with respect to
each other.

The fact that the asm is volatile should be enough to prevent this:
volatile asm statements should be executed in program order. However GCC
4.9.x and 5.x have a bug that might result in reordering. This was fixed
in 8.1, 7.3 and 6.5. Versions prior to these, including 5.x and 4.9.x,
may reorder volatile asm statements with respect to each other.

There are some issues with __force_order as implemented:
- It is used only as an input operand for the write functions, and hence
  doesn't do anything additional to prevent reordering writes.
- It allows memory accesses to be cached/reordered across write
  functions, but CRn writes affect the semantics of memory accesses, so
  this could be dangerous.
- __force_order is not actually defined in the kernel proper, but the
  LLVM toolchain can in some cases require a definition: LLVM (as well
  as GCC 4.9) requires it for PIE code, which is why the compressed
  kernel has a definition, but also the clang integrated assembler may
  consider the address of __force_order to be significant, resulting in
  a reference that requires a definition.

Fix this by:
- Using a memory clobber for the write functions to additionally prevent
  caching/reordering memory accesses across CRn writes.
- Using a dummy input operand with an arbitrary constant address for the
  read functions, instead of a global variable. This will prevent reads
  from being reordered across writes, while allowing memory loads to be
  cached/reordered across CRn reads, which should be safe.
