Subject: [PATCH] Bluetooth: MGMT: Fix marking SCAN_RSP as not connectable
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.39
Git-commit: 73f55453ea5236a586a7f1b3d5e2ee051d655351

[ Upstream commit 73f55453ea5236a586a7f1b3d5e2ee051d655351 ]

When receiving a scan response there is no way to know if the remote
device is connectable or not, so when it cannot be merged don't
make any assumption and instead just mark it with a new flag defined as
MGMT_DEV_FOUND_SCAN_RSP so userspace can tell it is a standalone
SCAN_RSP.
