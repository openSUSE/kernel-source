Subject: [PATCH] wifi: brcmfmac: cfg80211: Pass the PMK in binary instead of
 hex
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.30
Git-commit: 89b89e52153fda2733562776c7c9d9d3ebf8dd6d

[ Upstream commit 89b89e52153fda2733562776c7c9d9d3ebf8dd6d ]

Apparently the hex passphrase mechanism does not work on newer
chips/firmware (e.g. BCM4387). It seems there was a simple way of
passing it in binary all along, so use that and avoid the hexification.

OpenBSD has been doing it like this from the beginning, so this should
work on all chips.

Also clear the structure before setting the PMK. This was leaking
uninitialized stack contents to the device.
