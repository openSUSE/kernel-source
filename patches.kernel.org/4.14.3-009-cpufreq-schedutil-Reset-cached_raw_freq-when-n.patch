Subject: [PATCH] cpufreq: schedutil: Reset cached_raw_freq when not in sync
 with next_freq
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.3
Git-commit: 07458f6a5171d97511dfbdf6ce549ed2ca0280c7

commit 07458f6a5171d97511dfbdf6ce549ed2ca0280c7 upstream.

'cached_raw_freq' is used to get the next frequency quickly but should
always be in sync with sg_policy->next_freq. There is a case where it is
not and in such cases it should be reset to avoid switching to incorrect
frequencies.

Consider this case for example:

 - policy->cur is 1.2 GHz (Max)
 - New request comes for 780 MHz and we store that in cached_raw_freq.
 - Based on 780 MHz, we calculate the effective frequency as 800 MHz.
 - We then see the CPU wasn't idle recently and choose to keep the next
   freq as 1.2 GHz.
 - Now we have cached_raw_freq is 780 MHz and sg_policy->next_freq is
   1.2 GHz.
 - Now if the utilization doesn't change in then next request, then the
   next target frequency will still be 780 MHz and it will match with
   cached_raw_freq. But we will choose 1.2 GHz instead of 800 MHz here.
