Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/eeh: Handle hugepages in ioremap space
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.5
Git-commit: 33439620680be5225c1b8806579a291e0d761ca0

[ Upstream commit 33439620680be5225c1b8806579a291e0d761ca0 ]

In commit 4a7b06c157a2 ("powerpc/eeh: Handle hugepages in ioremap
space") support for using hugepages in the vmalloc and ioremap areas was
enabled for radix. Unfortunately this broke EEH MMIO error checking.

Detection works by inserting a hook which checks the results of the
ioreadXX() set of functions.  When a read returns a 0xFFs response we
need to check for an error which we do by mapping the (virtual) MMIO
address back to a physical address, then mapping physical address to a
PCI device via an interval tree.

When translating virt -> phys we currently assume the ioremap space is
only populated by PAGE_SIZE mappings. If a hugepage mapping is found we
emit a WARN_ON(), but otherwise handles the check as though a normal
page was found. In pathalogical cases such as copying a buffer
containing a lot of 0xFFs from BAR memory this can result in the system
not booting because it's too busy printing WARN_ON()s.

There's no real reason to assume huge pages can't be present and we're
prefectly capable of handling them, so do that.
