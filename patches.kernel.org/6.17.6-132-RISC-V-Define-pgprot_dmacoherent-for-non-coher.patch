Subject: [PATCH] RISC-V: Define pgprot_dmacoherent() for non-coherent devices
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.6
Git-commit: ca525d53f994d45c8140968b571372c45f555ac1

[ Upstream commit ca525d53f994d45c8140968b571372c45f555ac1 ]

The pgprot_dmacoherent() is used when allocating memory for
non-coherent devices and by default pgprot_dmacoherent() is
same as pgprot_noncached() unless architecture overrides it.

Currently, there is no pgprot_dmacoherent() definition for
RISC-V hence non-coherent device memory is being mapped as
IO thereby making CPU access to such memory slow.

Define pgprot_dmacoherent() to be same as pgprot_writecombine()
for RISC-V so that CPU access non-coherent device memory as
NOCACHE which is better than accessing it as IO.
