Subject: [PATCH] evm: Refuse EVM_ALLOW_METADATA_WRITES only if an HMAC key is
 loaded
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.2
Git-commit: 9acc89d31f0c94c8e573ed61f3e4340bbd526d0c

commit 9acc89d31f0c94c8e573ed61f3e4340bbd526d0c upstream.

EVM_ALLOW_METADATA_WRITES is an EVM initialization flag that can be set to
temporarily disable metadata verification until all xattrs/attrs necessary
to verify an EVM portable signature are copied to the file. This flag is
cleared when EVM is initialized with an HMAC key, to avoid that the HMAC is
calculated on unverified xattrs/attrs.

Currently EVM unnecessarily denies setting this flag if EVM is initialized
with a public key, which is not a concern as it cannot be used to trust
xattrs/attrs updates. This patch removes this limitation.
