Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: join: check re-using ID of unused ADD_ADDR
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.9
Git-commit: a13d5aad4dd9a309eecdc33cfd75045bd5f376a3

[ Upstream commit a13d5aad4dd9a309eecdc33cfd75045bd5f376a3 ]

This test extends "delete re-add signal" to validate the previous
commit. An extra address is announced by the server, but this address
cannot be used by the client. The result is that no subflow will be
established to this address.

Later, the server will delete this extra endpoint, and set a new one,
with a valid address, but re-using the same ID. Before the previous
commit, the server would not have been able to announce this new
address.

While at it, extra checks have been added to validate the expected
numbers of MPJ, ADD_ADDR and RM_ADDR.

The 'Fixes' tag here below is the same as the one from the previous
commit: this patch here is not fixing anything wrong in the selftests,
but it validates the previous fix for an issue introduced by this commit
ID.
