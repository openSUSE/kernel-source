[ Upstream commit 7b720c720253e2070459420b2628a7b9ee6733b3 ]

When the user increased the read-ahead size through sysfs this value
currently get lost if the device is reprobe, including on a resume
from suspend.

As there is no hardware limitation for the read-ahead size there is
no real need to reset it or track a separate hardware limitation
like for max_sectors.

This restores the pre-atomic queue limit behavior in the sd driver as
sd did not use blk_queue_io_opt and thus never updated the read ahead
size to the value based of the optimal I/O, but changes behavior for
all other drivers.  As the new behavior seems useful and sd is the
driver for which the readahead size tweaks are most useful that seems
like a worthwhile trade off.

Fixes: 804e498e0496 ("sd: convert to the atomic queue limits API")
