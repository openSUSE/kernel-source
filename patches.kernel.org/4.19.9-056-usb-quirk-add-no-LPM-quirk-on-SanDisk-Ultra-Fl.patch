Subject: [PATCH] usb: quirk: add no-LPM quirk on SanDisk Ultra Flair device
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.9
Git-commit: 2f2dde6ba89b1ef1fe23c1138131b315d9aa4019

commit 2f2dde6ba89b1ef1fe23c1138131b315d9aa4019 upstream.

Some lower volume SanDisk Ultra Flair in 16GB, which the VID:PID is
in 0781:5591, will aggressively request LPM of U1/U2 during runtime,
when using this thumb drive as the OS installation key we found the
device will generate failure during U1 exit path making it dropped
from the USB bus, this causes a corrupted installation in system at
the end.

i.e.,

[  166.918327] usb usb2-port2: link state change

[  167.276170] xhci_hcd 0000:00:15.0: shutdown urb ffffa3c7cc695cc0 ep1in-bulk
[  167.284055] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] tag#0 FAILED Result: hostbyte=DID_NO_CONNECT driverbyte=DRIVER_OK
[  167.284064] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] tag#0 CDB: Read(10) 28 00 00 33 04 90 00 01 00 00
...

Analyzed the USB trace in the link layer we realized it is because
of the 6-ms timer of tRecoveryConfigurationTimeout which documented
on the USB 3.2 Revision 1.0, the section 7.5.10.4.2 of "Exit from
Recovery.Configuration"; device initiates U1 exit -> Recovery.Active
-> Recovery.Configuration, then the host timer timeout makes the link
transits to eSS.Inactive -> Rx.Detect follows by a Warm Reset.

Interestingly, the other higher volume of SanDisk Ultra Flair sharing
the same VID:PID, such as 64GB, would not request LPM during runtime,
it sticks at U0 always, thus disabling LPM does not affect those thumb
drives at all.

The same odd occures in SanDisk Ultra Fit 16GB, VID:PID in 0781:5583.
