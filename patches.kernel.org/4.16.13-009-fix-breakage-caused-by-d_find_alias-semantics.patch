Subject: [PATCH] fix breakage caused by d_find_alias() semantics change
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.13
Git-commit: b127125d9db23e4856156a7c909a3c8e18b69f99

commit b127125d9db23e4856156a7c909a3c8e18b69f99 upstream.

"VFS: don't keep disconnected dentries on d_anon" had a non-trivial
side-effect - d_unhashed() now returns true for those dentries,
making d_find_alias() skip them altogether.  For most of its callers
that's fine - we really want a connected alias there.  However,
there is a codepath where we relied upon picking such aliases
if nothing else could be found - selinux delayed initialization
of contexts for inodes on already mounted filesystems used to
rely upon that.
