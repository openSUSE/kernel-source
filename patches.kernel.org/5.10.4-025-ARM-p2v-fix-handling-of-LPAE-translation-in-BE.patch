Subject: [PATCH] ARM: p2v: fix handling of LPAE translation in BE mode
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.4
Git-commit: 4e79f0211b473f8e1eab8211a9fd50cc41a3a061

[ Upstream commit 4e79f0211b473f8e1eab8211a9fd50cc41a3a061 ]

When running in BE mode on LPAE hardware with a PA-to-VA translation
that exceeds 4 GB, we patch bits 39:32 of the offset into the wrong
byte of the opcode. So fix that, by rotating the offset in r0 to the
right by 8 bits, which will put the 8-bit immediate in bits 31:24.

Note that this will also move bit #22 in its correct place when
applying the rotation to the constant #0x400000.

Fixes: d9a790df8e984 ("ARM: 7883/1: fix mov to mvn conversion in case of 64 bit phys_addr_t and BE")
