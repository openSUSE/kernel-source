commit d9470757398a700d9450a43508000bcfd010c7a4 upstream.

Chandan reported that fstests' generic/026 test hit a crash:

The instruction dump decodes as:
  subfic  r6,r5,8
  rlwinm  r6,r6,3,0,28
  ldbrx   r9,0,r3
  ldbrx   r10,0,r4      <-

Which shows us doing an 8 byte load from c00000062ac3fff9, which
crosses the page boundary at c00000062ac40000 and faults.

It's not OK for memcmp to read past the end of the source or
destination buffers if that would cross a page boundary, because we
don't know that the next page is mapped.

As pointed out by Segher, we can read past the end of the source or
destination as long as we don't cross a 4K boundary, because that's
our minimum page size on all platforms.

The bug is in the code at the .Lcmp_rest_lt8bytes label. When we get
there we know that s1 is 8-byte aligned and we have at least 1 byte to
read, so a single 8-byte load won't read past the end of s1 and cross
a page boundary.

But we have to be more careful with s2. So check if it's within 8
bytes of a 4K boundary and if so go to the byte-by-byte loop.
