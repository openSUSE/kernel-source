Subject: [PATCH] irqchip/gic-v3-its: Do not assume vPE tables are preallocated
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.7
Git-commit: ec4308ecfc887128a468f03fb66b767559c57c23

commit ec4308ecfc887128a468f03fb66b767559c57c23 upstream.

The GIC/ITS code is designed to ensure to pick up any preallocated LPI
tables on the redistributors, as enabling LPIs is a one-way switch. There
is no such restriction for vLPIs, and for GICv4.1 it is expected to
allocate a new vPE table at boot.

This works as intended when initializing an ITS, however when setting up a
redistributor in cpu_init_lpis() the early return for preallocated RD
tables skips straight past the GICv4 setup. This all comes to a head when
trying to kexec() into a new kernel, as the new kernel silently fails to
set up GICv4, leading to a complete loss of SGIs and LPIs for KVM VMs.

Slap a band-aid on the problem by ensuring its_cpu_init_lpis() always
initializes GICv4 on the way out, even if the other RD tables were
preallocated.
