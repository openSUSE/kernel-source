Subject: [PATCH] md/raid6: Set R5_ReadError when there is read failure on
 parity disk
References: bnc#1151927
Patch-mainline: 5.3.4
Git-commit: 143f6e733b73051cd22dcb80951c6c929da413ce

commit 143f6e733b73051cd22dcb80951c6c929da413ce upstream.

7471fb77ce4d ("md/raid6: Fix anomily when recovering a single device in
RAID6.") avoids rereading P when it can be computed from other members.
However, this misses the chance to re-write the right data to P. This
patch sets R5_ReadError if the re-read fails.

Also, when re-read is skipped, we also missed the chance to reset
rdev->read_errors to 0. It can fail the disk when there are many read
errors on P member disk (other disks don't have read error)

V2: upper layer read request don't read parity/Q data. So there is no
need to consider such situation.

This is Reported-by: kbuild test robot <lkp@intel.com>
