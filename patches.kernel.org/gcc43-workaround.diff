Subject: [PATCH] time: mark timespec_add_ns's u64 parameter as volatile to avoid gcc 4.3 optimization
Patch-mainline: No idea, Linus views this as a gcc bug.

 This patch avoids an optimization introduced in gcc 4.3 where it will
 take a loop of subtractions and turn them into a division. Since the
 kernel doesn't support long long division by adding a __udivdi3, we
 can't use this optimization.

 This should probably be ifdef'd to only apply on 32-bit architectures,
 since the problem doesn't exist on 64-bit arches.
