Subject: [PATCH] dma-buf: Move BUG_ON from _add_shared_fence to
 _add_shared_inplace

commit 7f43ef9f0d98abbc0eb5e697628ec06756bf60a9 upstream.

Fixes the BUG_ON spuriously triggering under the following
circumstances:

* reservation_object_reserve_shared is called with shared_count ==
  shared_max - 1, so obj->staged is freed in preparation of an in-place
  update.

* reservation_object_add_shared_fence is called with the first fence,
  after which shared_count == shared_max.

* reservation_object_add_shared_fence is called with a follow-up fence
  from the same context.

In the second reservation_object_add_shared_fence call, the BUG_ON
triggers. However, nothing bad would happen in
reservation_object_add_shared_inplace, since both fences are from the
same context, so they only occupy a single slot.

Prevent this by moving the BUG_ON to where an overflow would actually
happen (e.g. if a buggy caller didn't call
reservation_object_reserve_shared before).

v2:
* Fix description of breaking scenario (Christian König)
* Add bugzilla reference
