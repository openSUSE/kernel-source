Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda: call runtime_allow() for all hda controllers
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.9
Git-commit: 9a6418487b566503c772cb6e7d3d44e652b019b0

[ Upstream commit 9a6418487b566503c772cb6e7d3d44e652b019b0 ]

Before the pci_driver->probe() is called, the pci subsystem calls
runtime_forbid() and runtime_get_sync() on this pci dev, so only call
runtime_put_autosuspend() is not enough to enable the runtime_pm on
this device.

For controllers with vgaswitcheroo feature, the pci/quirks.c will call
runtime_allow() for this dev, then the controllers could enter
rt_idle/suspend/resume, but for non-vgaswitcheroo controllers like
Intel hda controllers, the runtime_pm is not enabled because the
runtime_allow() is not called.

Since it is no harm calling runtime_allow() twice, here let hda
driver call runtime_allow() for all controllers. Then the runtime_pm
is enabled on all controllers after the put_autosuspend() is called.
