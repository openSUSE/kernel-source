Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/hdmi: Don't skip notification handling during PM
 operation
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.3
Git-commit: 5226c7b9784eee215e3914f440b3c2e1764f67a8

[ Upstream commit 5226c7b9784eee215e3914f440b3c2e1764f67a8 ]

The HDMI driver skips the notification handling from the graphics
driver when the codec driver is being in the PM operation.  This
behavior was introduced by the commit eb399d3c99d8 ("ALSA: hda - Skip
ELD notification during PM process").  This skip may cause a problem,
as we may miss the ELD update when the connection/disconnection
happens right at the runtime-PM operation of the audio codec.

Although this workaround was valid at that time, it's no longer true;
the fix was required just because the ELD update procedure needed to
wake up the audio codec, which had lead to a runtime-resume during a
runtime-suspend.  Meanwhile, the ELD update procedure doesn't need a
codec wake up any longer since the commit 788d441a164c ("ALSA: hda -
Use component ops for i915 HDMI/DP audio jack handling"); i.e. there
is no much reason for skipping the notification.

Let's drop those checks for addressing the missing notification.
