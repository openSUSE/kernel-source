Subject: [PATCH] b43: fix DMA error related regression with proprietary
 firmware
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.13
Git-commit: 2823c8716c687d6c7e261a3a02b3cab43809fe9c

commit 2823c8716c687d6c7e261a3a02b3cab43809fe9c upstream.

In commit 66cffd6daab7 ("b43: fix transmit failure when VT is switched"),
a condition is noted where the network controller needs to be reset. Note
that this situation happens when running the open-source firmware
(http://netweb.ing.unibs.it/~openfwwf/), plus a number of other special
conditions.

for a different card model, it is reported that this change breaks
operation running the proprietary firmware
(https://marc.info/?l=linux-wireless&m=153504546924558&w=2). Rather
than reverting the previous patch, the code is tweaked to avoid the
reset unless the open-source firmware is being used.
