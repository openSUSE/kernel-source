Subject: [PATCH] vdpa_sim: set last_used_idx as last_avail_idx in

[ Upstream commit b4cca6d48eb3fa6f0d9caba4329b1a2b0ff67a77 ]

Starting from an used_idx different than 0 is needed in use cases like
virtual machine migration.  Not doing so and letting the caller set an
avail idx different than 0 causes destination device to try to use old
buffers that source driver already recover and are not available
anymore.

Since vdpa_sim does not support receive inflight descriptors as a
destination of a migration, let's set both avail_idx and used_idx the
same at vq start.  This is how vhost-user works in a
VHOST_SET_VRING_BASE call.

Although the simple fix is to set last_used_idx at vdpasim_set_vq_state,
it would be reset at vdpasim_queue_ready.  The last_avail_idx case is
fixed with commit 0e84f918fac8 ("vdpa_sim: not reset state in
vdpasim_queue_ready").  Since the only option is to make it equal to
last_avail_idx, adding the only change needed here.

This was discovered and tested live migrating the vdpa_sim_net device.
