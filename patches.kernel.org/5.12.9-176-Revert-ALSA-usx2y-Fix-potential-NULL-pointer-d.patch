Subject: [PATCH] Revert "ALSA: usx2y: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference"
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.9
Git-commit: 4667a6fc1777ce071504bab570d3599107f4790f

[ Upstream commit 4667a6fc1777ce071504bab570d3599107f4790f ]

This reverts commit a2c6433ee5a35a8de6d563f6512a26f87835ea0f.

Because of recent interactions with developers from @umn.edu, all
commits from them have been recently re-reviewed to ensure if they were
correct or not.

Upon review, this commit was found to be incorrect for the reasons
below, so it must be reverted.  It will be fixed up "correctly" in a
later kernel change.

The original patch was incorrect, and would leak memory if the error
path the patch added was hit.
