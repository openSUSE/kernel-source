Subject: [PATCH] net: rfkill: gpio: prevent value glitch during probe
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.9
Git-commit: b2f750c3a80b285cd60c9346f8c96bd0a2a66cde

commit b2f750c3a80b285cd60c9346f8c96bd0a2a66cde upstream.

When either reset- or shutdown-gpio have are initially deasserted,
e.g. after a reboot - or when the hardware does not include pull-down,
there will be a short toggle of both IOs to logical 0 and back to 1.

It seems that the rfkill default is unblocked, so the driver should not
glitch to output low during probe.
It can lead e.g. to unexpected lte modem reconnect:

[1] root@localhost:~# dmesg | grep "usb 2-1"
[    2.136124] usb 2-1: new SuperSpeed USB device number 2 using xhci-hcd
[   21.215278] usb 2-1: USB disconnect, device number 2
[   28.833977] usb 2-1: new SuperSpeed USB device number 3 using xhci-hcd

The glitch has been discovered on an arm64 board, now that device-tree
support for the rfkill-gpio driver has finally appeared :).

Change the flags for devm_gpiod_get_optional from GPIOD_OUT_LOW to
GPIOD_ASIS to avoid any glitches.
The rfkill driver will set the intended value during rfkill_sync_work.
