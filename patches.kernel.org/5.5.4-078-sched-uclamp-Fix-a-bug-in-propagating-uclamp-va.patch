Subject: [PATCH] sched/uclamp: Fix a bug in propagating uclamp value in new
 cgroups
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.4
Git-commit: 7226017ad37a888915628e59a84a2d1e57b40707

commit 7226017ad37a888915628e59a84a2d1e57b40707 upstream.

When a new cgroup is created, the effective uclamp value wasn't updated
with a call to cpu_util_update_eff() that looks at the hierarchy and
update to the most restrictive values.

Fix it by ensuring to call cpu_util_update_eff() when a new cgroup
becomes online.

Without this change, the newly created cgroup uses the default
root_task_group uclamp values, which is 1024 for both uclamp_{min, max},
which will cause the rq to to be clamped to max, hence cause the
system to run at max frequency.

The problem was observed on Ubuntu server and was reproduced on Debian
and Buildroot rootfs.

By default, Ubuntu and Debian create a cpu controller cgroup hierarchy
and add all tasks to it - which creates enough noise to keep the rq
uclamp value at max most of the time. Imitating this behavior makes the
problem visible in Buildroot too which otherwise looks fine since it's a
minimal userspace.
