Subject: [PATCH] block/swim: Fix IO error at end of medium
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.6
Git-commit: 5a13388d7aa1177b98d7168330ecbeeac52f844d

commit 5a13388d7aa1177b98d7168330ecbeeac52f844d upstream.

Reading to the end of a 720K disk results in an IO error instead of EOF
because the block layer thinks the disk has 2880 sectors. (Partly this
is a result of inverted logic of the ONEMEG_MEDIA bit that's now fixed.)

Initialize the density and head count in swim_add_floppy() to agree
with the device size passed to set_capacity() during drive probe.

Call set_capacity() again upon device open, after refreshing the density
and head count values.
