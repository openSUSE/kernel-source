Subject: [PATCH] Revert "gpio/spi: Fix spi-gpio regression on active high CS"
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.4
Git-commit: da7f134972f473053ea9d721a1d8397546476dc4

commit da7f134972f473053ea9d721a1d8397546476dc4 upstream.

This reverts commit fbbf145a0e0a0177e089c52275fbfa55763e7d1d.

It seems I was misguided in my fixup, which was working at the
time but did not work on the final v5.2.

The patch tried to avoid a quirk the gpiolib code not to treat
"spi-gpio" CS gpios "special" by enforcing them to be active
low, in the belief that since the "spi-gpio" driver was
parsing the device tree on its own, it did not care to inspect
the "spi-cs-high" attribute on the device nodes.

That's wrong. The SPI core was inspecting them inside the
of_spi_parse_dt() funtion and setting SPI_CS_HIGH on the
nodes, and the driver inspected this flag when driving the
line.

As of now, the core handles the GPIO and it will consistently
set the GPIO descriptor to 1 to enable CS, strictly requireing
the gpiolib to invert it. And the gpiolib should indeed
enforce active low on the CS line.

Device trees should of course put the right flag on the GPIO
handles, but it used to not matter. If we don't enforce active
low on "gpio-gpio" we may run into ABI backward compatibility
issues, so revert this.
