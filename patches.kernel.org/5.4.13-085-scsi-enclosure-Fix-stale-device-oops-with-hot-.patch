Subject: [PATCH] scsi: enclosure: Fix stale device oops with hot replug
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.13
Git-commit: 529244bd1afc102ab164429d338d310d5d65e60d

commit 529244bd1afc102ab164429d338d310d5d65e60d upstream.

Doing an add/remove/add on a SCSI device in an enclosure leads to an oops
caused by poisoned values in the enclosure device list pointers.  The
reason is because we are keeping the enclosure device across the enclosed
device add/remove/add but the current code is doing a
device_add/device_del/device_add on it.  This is the wrong thing to do in
sysfs, so fix it by not doing a device_del on the enclosure device simply
because of a hot remove of the drive in the slot.
