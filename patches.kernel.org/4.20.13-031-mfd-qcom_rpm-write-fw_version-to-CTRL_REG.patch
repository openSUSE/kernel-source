Subject: [PATCH] mfd: qcom_rpm: write fw_version to CTRL_REG
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.13
Git-commit: 504e4175829c44328773b96ad9c538e4783a8d22

[ Upstream commit 504e4175829c44328773b96ad9c538e4783a8d22 ]

This is required as part of the initialization sequence on certain SoCs.

If these registers are not initialized, the hardware can be unresponsive.
This fixes the driver on apq8060 (HP TouchPad device).
