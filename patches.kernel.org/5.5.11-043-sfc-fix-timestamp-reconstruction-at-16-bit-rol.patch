Subject: [PATCH] sfc: fix timestamp reconstruction at 16-bit rollover points
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.11
Git-commit: 23797b98909f34b75fd130369bde86f760db69d0

[ Upstream commit 23797b98909f34b75fd130369bde86f760db69d0 ]

We can't just use the top bits of the last sync event as they could be
off-by-one every 65,536 seconds, giving an error in reconstruction of
65,536 seconds.

This patch uses the difference in the bottom 16 bits (mod 2^16) to
calculate an offset that needs to be applied to the last sync event to
get to the current time.
