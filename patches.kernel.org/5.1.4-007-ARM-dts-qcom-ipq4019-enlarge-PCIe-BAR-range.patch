Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: qcom: ipq4019: enlarge PCIe BAR range
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.4
Git-commit: f3e35357cd460a8aeb48b8113dc4b761a7d5c828

commit f3e35357cd460a8aeb48b8113dc4b761a7d5c828 upstream.

David Bauer reported that the VDSL modem (attached via PCIe)
on his AVM Fritz!Box 7530 was complaining about not having
enough space in the BAR. A closer inspection of the old
qcom-ipq40xx.dtsi pulled from the GL-iNet repository listed:

| qcom,pcie@80000 {
|	compatible = "qcom,msm_pcie";
|	reg = <0x80000 0x2000>,
|	      <0x99000 0x800>,
|	      <0x40000000 0xf1d>,
|	      <0x40000f20 0xa8>,
|	      <0x40100000 0x1000>,
|	      <0x40200000 0x100000>,
|	      <0x40300000 0xd00000>;
|	reg-names = "parf", "phy", "dm_core", "elbi",
|			"conf", "io", "bars";

Matching the reg-names with the listed reg leads to
<0xd00000> as the size for the "bars".
