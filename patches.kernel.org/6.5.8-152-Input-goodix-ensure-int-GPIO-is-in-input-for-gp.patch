Subject: [PATCH] Input: goodix - ensure int GPIO is in input for gpio_count ==
 1 && gpio_int_idx == 0 case
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.8
Git-commit: 423622a90abb243944d1517b9f57db53729e45c4

commit 423622a90abb243944d1517b9f57db53729e45c4 upstream.

Add a special case for gpio_count == 1 && gpio_int_idx == 0 to
goodix_add_acpi_gpio_mappings().

It seems that on newer x86/ACPI devices the reset and irq GPIOs are no
longer listed as GPIO resources instead there is only 1 GpioInt resource
and _PS0 does the whole reset sequence for us.

This means that we must call acpi_device_fix_up_power() on these devices
to ensure that the chip is reset before we try to use it.

This part was already fixed in commit 3de93e6ed2df ("Input: goodix - call
acpi_device_fix_up_power() in some cases") by adding a call to
acpi_device_fix_up_power() to the generic "Unexpected ACPI resources"
catch all.

But it turns out that this case on some hw needs some more special
handling. Specifically the firmware may bootup with the IRQ pin in
output mode. The reset sequence from ACPI _PS0 (executed by
acpi_device_fix_up_power()) should put the pin in input mode,
but the GPIO subsystem has cached the direction at bootup, causing
request_irq() to fail due to gpiochip_lock_as_irq() failure:

[    9.119864] Goodix-TS i2c-GDIX1002:00: Unexpected ACPI resources: gpio_count 1, gpio_int_idx 0
[    9.317443] Goodix-TS i2c-GDIX1002:00: ID 911, version: 1060
[    9.321902] input: Goodix Capacitive TouchScreen as /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:17.0/i2c_designware.4/i2c-5/i2c-GDIX1002:00/input/input8
[    9.327840] gpio gpiochip0: (INT3453:00): gpiochip_lock_as_irq: tried to flag a GPIO set as output for IRQ
[    9.327856] gpio gpiochip0: (INT3453:00): unable to lock HW IRQ 26 for IRQ
[    9.327861] genirq: Failed to request resources for GDIX1002:00 (irq 131) on irqchip intel-gpio
[    9.327912] Goodix-TS i2c-GDIX1002:00: request IRQ failed: -5

Fix this by adding a special case for gpio_count == 1 && gpio_int_idx == 0
which adds an ACPI GPIO lookup table for the int GPIO even though we cannot
use it for reset purposes (as there is no reset GPIO).

Adding the lookup will make the gpiod_int = gpiod_get(..., GPIOD_IN) call
succeed, which will explicitly set the direction to input fixing the issue.

Note this re-uses the acpi_goodix_int_first_gpios[] lookup table, since
there is only 1 GPIO in the ACPI resources the reset entry in that
lookup table will amount to a no-op.
