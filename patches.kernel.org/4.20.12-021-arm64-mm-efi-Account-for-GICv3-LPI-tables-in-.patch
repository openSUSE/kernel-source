Subject: [PATCH] arm64, mm, efi: Account for GICv3 LPI tables in static
 memblock reserve table
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.12
Git-commit: de3d833d6bdd8ba56252556038eccf2118e67c05

Commit 8a5b403d71affa098009cc3dff1b2c45113021ad upstream.

In the irqchip and EFI code, we have what basically amounts to a quirk
to work around a peculiarity in the GICv3 architecture, which permits
the system memory address of LPI tables to be programmable only once
after a CPU reset. This means kexec kernels must use the same memory
as the first kernel, and thus ensure that this memory has not been
given out for other purposes by the time the ITS init code runs, which
is not very early for secondary CPUs.

On systems with many CPUs, these reservations could overflow the
memblock reservation table, and this was addressed in commit:

  eff896288872 ("efi/arm: Defer persistent reservations until after paging_init()")

However, this turns out to have made things worse, since the allocation
of page tables and heap space for the resized memblock reservation table
itself may overwrite the regions we are attempting to reserve, which may
cause all kinds of corruption, also considering that the ITS will still
be poking bits into that memory in response to incoming MSIs.

So instead, let's grow the static memblock reservation table on such
systems so it can accommodate these reservations at an earlier time.
This will permit us to revert the above commit in a subsequent patch.
