Subject: [PATCH] net: mdio: aspeed: add dummy read to avoid read-after-write
 issue
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.64
Git-commit: d1a1a4bade4b20c0858d0b2f81d2611de055f675

[ Upstream commit d1a1a4bade4b20c0858d0b2f81d2611de055f675 ]

The Aspeed MDIO controller may return incorrect data when a read operation
follows immediately after a write. Due to a controller bug, the subsequent
read can latch stale data, causing the polling logic to terminate earlier
than expected.

To work around this hardware issue, insert a dummy read after each write
operation. This ensures that the next actual read returns the correct
data and prevents premature polling exit.

This workaround has been verified to stabilize MDIO transactions on
affected Aspeed platforms.
