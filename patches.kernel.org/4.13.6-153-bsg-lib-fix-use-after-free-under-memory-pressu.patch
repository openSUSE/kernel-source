Subject: [PATCH] bsg-lib: fix use-after-free under memory-pressure
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.13.6
Git-commit: eab40cf336065e8d765e006b81ff48c5c114b365

commit eab40cf336065e8d765e006b81ff48c5c114b365 upstream.

When under memory-pressure it is possible that the mempool which backs
the 'struct request_queue' will make use of up to BLKDEV_MIN_RQ count
emergency buffers - in case it can't get a regular allocation. These
buffers are preallocated and once they are also used, they are
re-supplied with old finished requests from the same request_queue (see
mempool_free()).

The bug is, when re-supplying the emergency pool, the old requests are
not again ran through the callback mempool_t->alloc(), and thus also not
through the callback bsg_init_rq(). Thus we skip initialization, and
while the sense-buffer still should be good, scsi_request->cmd might
have become to be an invalid pointer in the meantime. When the request
is initialized in bsg.c, and the user's CDB is larger than BLK_MAX_CDB,
bsg will replace it with a custom allocated buffer, which is freed when
the user's command is finished, thus it dangles afterwards. When next a
command is sent by the user that has a smaller/similar CDB as
BLK_MAX_CDB, bsg will assume that scsi_request->cmd is backed by
scsi_request->__cmd, will not make a custom allocation, and write into
undefined memory.

Fix this by splitting bsg_init_rq() into two functions:
 - bsg_init_rq() is changed to only do the allocation of the
   sense-buffer, which is used to back the bsg job's reply buffer. This
   pointer should never change during the lifetime of a scsi_request, so
   it doesn't need re-initialization.
 - bsg_initialize_rq() is a new function that makes use of
   'struct request_queue's initialize_rq_fn callback (which was
   introduced in v4.12). This is always called before the request is
   given out via blk_get_request(). This function does the remaining
   initialization that was previously done in bsg_init_rq(), and will
   also do it when the request is taken from the emergency-pool of the
   backing mempool.
