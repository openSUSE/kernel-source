Subject: [PATCH] objtool: Don't fail the kernel build on fatal errors
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.14
Git-commit: 655cf86548a3938538642a6df27dd359e13c86bd

[ Upstream commit 655cf86548a3938538642a6df27dd359e13c86bd ]

This is basically a revert of commit 644592d32837 ("objtool: Fail the
kernel build on fatal errors").

That change turned out to be more trouble than it's worth.  Failing the
build is an extreme measure which sometimes gets too much attention and
blocks CI build testing.

These fatal-type warnings aren't yet as rare as we'd hope, due to the
ever-increasing matrix of supported toolchains/plugins and their
fast-changing nature as of late.

Also, there are more people (and bots) looking for objtool warnings than
ever before, so even non-fatal warnings aren't likely to be ignored for
long.
