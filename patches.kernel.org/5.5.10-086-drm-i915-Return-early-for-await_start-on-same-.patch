Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: Return early for await_start on same timeline
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.10
Git-commit: c951b0af2dddbb1f34be103029eb9030392d5554

commit c951b0af2dddbb1f34be103029eb9030392d5554 upstream.

Requests within a timeline are ordered by that timeline, so awaiting for
the start of a request within the timeline is a no-op. This used to work
by falling out of the mutex_trylock() as the signaler and waiter had the
same timeline and not returning an error.
