Subject: [PATCH] mm/vmscan: accumulate nr_demoted for accurate demotion
 statistics
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.3
Git-commit: a479b078fddb0ad7f9e3c6da22d9cf8f2b5c7799

commit a479b078fddb0ad7f9e3c6da22d9cf8f2b5c7799 upstream.

In shrink_folio_list(), demote_folio_list() can be called 2 times.
Currently stat->nr_demoted will only store the last nr_demoted( the later
nr_demoted is always zero, the former nr_demoted will get lost), as a
result number of demoted pages is not accurate.

Accumulate the nr_demoted count across multiple calls to
demote_folio_list(), ensuring accurate reporting of demotion statistics.
