Subject: [PATCH] arm64: ssbd: Introduce thread flag to control userspace
 mitigation
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.9
Git-commit: 9dd9614f5476687abbff8d4b12cd08ae70d7c2ad

commit 9dd9614f5476687abbff8d4b12cd08ae70d7c2ad upstream.

In order to allow userspace to be mitigated on demand, let's
introduce a new thread flag that prevents the mitigation from
being turned off when exiting to userspace, and doesn't turn
it on on entry into the kernel (with the assumption that the
mitigation is always enabled in the kernel itself).

This will be used by a prctl interface introduced in a later
patch.
