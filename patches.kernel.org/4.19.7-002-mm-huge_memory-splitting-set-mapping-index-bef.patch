Subject: [PATCH] mm/huge_memory: splitting set mapping+index before unfreeze
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.7
Git-commit: 173d9d9fd3ddae84c110fea8aedf1f26af6be9ec

commit 173d9d9fd3ddae84c110fea8aedf1f26af6be9ec upstream.

Huge tmpfs stress testing has occasionally hit shmem_undo_range()'s
VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(page_to_pgoff(page) != index, page).

Move the setting of mapping and index up before the page_ref_unfreeze()
in __split_huge_page_tail() to fix this: so that a page cache lookup
cannot get a reference while the tail's mapping and index are unstable.

In fact, might as well move them up before the smp_wmb(): I don't see an
actual need for that, but if I'm missing something, this way round is
safer than the other, and no less efficient.

You might argue that VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(page_to_pgoff(page) != index, page) is
misplaced, and should be left until after the trylock_page(); but left as
is has not crashed since, and gives more stringent assurance.
