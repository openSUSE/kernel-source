Subject: [PATCH] m68k: Add -ffreestanding to CFLAGS
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.4
Git-commit: 28713169d879b67be2ef2f84dcf54905de238294

commit 28713169d879b67be2ef2f84dcf54905de238294 upstream.

This patch fixes a build failure when using GCC 8.1:

/usr/bin/ld: block/partitions/ldm.o: in function `ldm_parse_tocblock':
block/partitions/ldm.c:153: undefined reference to `strcmp'

This is caused by a new optimization which effectively replaces a
strncmp() call with a strcmp() call. This affects a number of strncmp()
call sites in the kernel.

The entire class of optimizations is avoided with -fno-builtin, which
gets enabled by -ffreestanding. This may avoid possible future build
failures in case new optimizations appear in future compilers.

I haven't done any performance measurements with this patch but I did
count the function calls in a defconfig build. For example, there are now
23 more sprintf() calls and 39 fewer strcpy() calls. The effect on the
other libc functions is smaller.

If this harms performance we can tackle that regression by optimizing
the call sites, ideally using semantic patches. That way, clang and ICC
builds might benfit too.
