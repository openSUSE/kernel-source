Subject: [PATCH] IB/usnic: Fix potential deadlock
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.5
Git-commit: 8036e90f92aae2784b855a0007ae2d8154d28b3c

[ Upstream commit 8036e90f92aae2784b855a0007ae2d8154d28b3c ]

Acquiring the rtnl lock while holding usdev_lock could result in a
deadlock.

For example:

usnic_ib_query_port()
| mutex_lock(&us_ibdev->usdev_lock)
 | ib_get_eth_speed()
  | rtnl_lock()

rtnl_lock()
| usnic_ib_netdevice_event()
 | mutex_lock(&us_ibdev->usdev_lock)

This commit moves the usdev_lock acquisition after the rtnl lock has been
released.

This is safe to do because usdev_lock is not protecting anything being
accessed in ib_get_eth_speed(). Hence, the correct order of holding locks
(rtnl -> usdev_lock) is not violated.
