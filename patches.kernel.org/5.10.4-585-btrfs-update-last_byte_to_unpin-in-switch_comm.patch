Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: update last_byte_to_unpin in switch_commit_roots
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.4
Git-commit: 27d56e62e4748c2135650c260024e9904b8c1a0a

commit 27d56e62e4748c2135650c260024e9904b8c1a0a upstream.

While writing an explanation for the need of the commit_root_sem for
btrfs_prepare_extent_commit, I realized we have a slight hole that could
result in leaked space if we have to do the old style caching.  Consider
the following scenario

 commit root
 +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
 |\\\\|    |\\\\|\\\\|    |\\\\|\\\\|
 +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
 0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7

 new commit root
 +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
 |    |    |    |\\\\|    |    |\\\\|
 +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
 0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7

Prior to this patch, we run btrfs_prepare_extent_commit, which updates
the last_byte_to_unpin, and then we subsequently run
switch_commit_roots.  In this example lets assume that
caching_ctl->progress == 1 at btrfs_prepare_extent_commit() time, which
means that cache->last_byte_to_unpin == 1.  Then we go and do the
switch_commit_roots(), but in the meantime the caching thread has made
some more progress, because we drop the commit_root_sem and re-acquired
it.  Now caching_ctl->progress == 3.  We swap out the commit root and
carry on to unpin.

The race can happen like:

  1) The caching thread was running using the old commit root when it
     found the extent for [2, 3);

  2) Then it released the commit_root_sem because it was in the last
     item of a leaf and the semaphore was contended, and set ->progress
     to 3 (value of 'last'), as the last extent item in the current leaf
     was for the extent for range [2, 3);

  3) Next time it gets the commit_root_sem, will start using the new
     commit root and search for a key with offset 3, so it never finds
     the hole for [2, 3).

  So the caching thread never saw [2, 3) as free space in any of the
  commit roots, and by the time finish_extent_commit() was called for
  the range [0, 3), ->last_byte_to_unpin was 1, so it only returned the
  subrange [0, 1) to the free space cache, skipping [2, 3).

In the unpin code we have last_byte_to_unpin == 1, so we unpin [0,1),
but do not unpin [2,3).  However because caching_ctl->progress == 3 we
do not see the newly freed section of [2,3), and thus do not add it to
our free space cache.  This results in us missing a chunk of free space
in memory (on disk too, unless we have a power failure before writing
the free space cache to disk).

Fix this by making sure the ->last_byte_to_unpin is set at the same time
that we swap the commit roots, this ensures that we will always be
consistent.
