Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: mvebu: pl310-cache disable double-linefill
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.13.12
Git-commit: cda80a82ac3e89309706c027ada6ab232be1d640

commit cda80a82ac3e89309706c027ada6ab232be1d640 upstream.

Under heavy system stress mvebu SoC using Cortex A9 sporadically
encountered instability issues.

The "double linefill" feature of L2 cache was identified as causing
dependency between read and write which lead to the deadlock.

Especially, it was the cause of deadlock seen under heavy PCIe traffic,
as this dependency violates PCIE overtaking rule.

Fixes: c8f5a878e554 ("ARM: mvebu: use DT properties to fine-tune the L2 configuration")
