Subject: [PATCH] driver core: platform: return -ENXIO for missing GpioInt
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.9
Git-commit: 46c42d844211ef5902e32aa507beac0817c585e9

commit 46c42d844211ef5902e32aa507beac0817c585e9 upstream.

Commit daaef255dc96 ("driver: platform: Support parsing GpioInt 0 in
platform_get_irq()") broke the Embedded Controller driver on most LPC
Chromebooks (i.e., most x86 Chromebooks), because cros_ec_lpc expects
platform_get_irq() to return -ENXIO for non-existent IRQs.
Unfortunately, acpi_dev_gpio_irq_get() doesn't follow this convention
and returns -ENOENT instead. So we get this error from cros_ec_lpc:

   couldn't retrieve IRQ number (-2)

I see a variety of drivers that treat -ENXIO specially, so rather than
fix all of them, let's fix up the API to restore its previous behavior.

I reported this on v2 of this patch:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190220180538.GA42642@google.com/

but apparently the patch had already been merged before v3 got sent out:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190221193429.161300-1-egranata@chromium.org/

and the result is that the bug landed and remains unfixed.

I differ from the v3 patch by:
 * allowing for ret==0, even though acpi_dev_gpio_irq_get() specifically
   documents (and enforces) that 0 is not a valid return value (noted on
   the v3 review)
 * adding a small comment
