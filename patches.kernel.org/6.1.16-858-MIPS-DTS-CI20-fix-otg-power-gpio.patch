Subject: [PATCH] MIPS: DTS: CI20: fix otg power gpio
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: 0cb4228f6cc9ed0ca2be0d9ddf29168a8e3a3905

commit 0cb4228f6cc9ed0ca2be0d9ddf29168a8e3a3905 upstream.

According to schematics it is PF15 and not PF14 (MIC_SW_EN).
Seems as if it was hidden and not noticed during testing since
there is no sound DT node.

Fixes: 158c774d3c64 ("MIPS: Ingenic: Add missing nodes for Ingenic SoCs and boards.")
