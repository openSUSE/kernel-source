Subject: [PATCH] mm/damon/core: initialize damo_filter->list from
 damos_new_filter()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.4.11
Git-commit: 5f1fc67f2cb8d3035d3acd273b48b97835af8afd

commit 5f1fc67f2cb8d3035d3acd273b48b97835af8afd upstream.

damos_new_filter() is not initializing the list field of newly allocated
filter object.  However, DAMON sysfs interface and DAMON_RECLAIM are not
initializing it after calling damos_new_filter().  As a result, accessing
uninitialized memory is possible.  Actually, adding multiple DAMOS filters
via DAMON sysfs interface caused NULL pointer dereferencing.  Initialize
the field just after the allocation from damos_new_filter().
