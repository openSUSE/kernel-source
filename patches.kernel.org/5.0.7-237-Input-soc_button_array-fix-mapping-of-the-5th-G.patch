Subject: [PATCH] Input: soc_button_array - fix mapping of the 5th GPIO in a
 PNP0C40 device
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.7
Git-commit: e9eb788f9442d1b5d93efdb30c3be071ce8a22b1

[ Upstream commit e9eb788f9442d1b5d93efdb30c3be071ce8a22b1 ]

The Microsoft documenation for the PNP0C40 device aka the
"Windows-compatible button array" describes the 5th GpioInt listed in
the resources as: '5. Interrupt corresponding to the "Rotation Lock"
button, if supported'.

Notice this describes the 5th entry as a button while we sofar have been
mapping it to EV_SW, SW_ROTATE_LOCK. On my Point of View TAB P1006W-232
which actually comes with a rotation-lock button, the button indeed is a
button and not a slider/switch. An image search for other Windows tablets
has found 2 more models with a rotation-lock button and on both of those
it too is a push-button and not a slider/switch.

Further evidence can be found in the HUT extension HUTRR52 from Microsoft
which adds rotation lock support to the HUT, which describes 2 different
usages: "0xC9 System Display Rotation Lock Button" and
"0xCA System Display Rotation Lock Slider Switch" note that switch is seen
as a separate thing here and the non switch wording is an exact match for
the "Windows-compatible button array" spec wording.

TL;DR: our current mapping of the 5th GPIO to SW_ROTATE_LOCK is wrong
because the 5th GPIO is for a push-button not a switch.

This commit fixes this by maping the 5th GPIO to KEY_ROTATE_LOCK_TOGGLE.
