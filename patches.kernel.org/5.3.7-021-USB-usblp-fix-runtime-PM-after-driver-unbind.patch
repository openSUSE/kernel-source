Subject: [PATCH] USB: usblp: fix runtime PM after driver unbind
References: bnc#1151927
Patch-mainline: 5.3.7
Git-commit: 9a31535859bfd8d1c3ed391f5e9247cd87bb7909

commit 9a31535859bfd8d1c3ed391f5e9247cd87bb7909 upstream.

Since commit c2b71462d294 ("USB: core: Fix bug caused by duplicate
interface PM usage counter") USB drivers must always balance their
runtime PM gets and puts, including when the driver has already been
unbound from the interface.

Leaving the interface with a positive PM usage counter would prevent a
later bound driver from suspending the device.

Fixes: c2b71462d294 ("USB: core: Fix bug caused by duplicate interface PM usage counter")
