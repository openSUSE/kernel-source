Subject: [PATCH] HID: multitouch: handle faulty Elo touch device
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.12
Git-commit: 81bcbad53bab4bf9f200eda303d7a05cdb9bd73b

commit 81bcbad53bab4bf9f200eda303d7a05cdb9bd73b upstream.

Since kernel v5.0, one single win8 touchscreen device failed.
And it turns out this is because it reports 2 InRange usage per touch.

It's a first, and I *really* wonder how this was allowed by Microsoft in
the first place. But IIRC, Breno told me this happened *after* a firmware
upgrade...

Anyway, better be safe for those crappy devices, and make sure we have
a full slot before jumping to the next.
This won't prevent all crappy devices to fail here, but at least we will
have a safeguard as long as the contact ID and the X and Y coordinates
are placed in the report after the grabage.
