Subject: [PATCH] crypto: jitter - correct health test during initialization
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.39
Git-commit: d23659769ad1bf2cbafaa0efcbae20ef1a74f77e

[ Upstream commit d23659769ad1bf2cbafaa0efcbae20ef1a74f77e ]

With the update of the permanent and intermittent health errors, the
actual indicator for the health test indicates a potential error only
for the one offending time stamp gathered in the current iteration
round. The next iteration round will "overwrite" the health test result.

Thus, the entropy collection loop in jent_gen_entropy checks for
the health test failure upon each loop iteration. However, the
initialization operation checked for the APT health test once for
an APT window which implies it would not catch most errors.

Thus, the check for all health errors is now invoked unconditionally
during each loop iteration for the startup test.

With the change, the error JENT_ERCT becomes unused as all health
errors are only reported with the JENT_HEALTH return code. This
allows the removal of the error indicator.
