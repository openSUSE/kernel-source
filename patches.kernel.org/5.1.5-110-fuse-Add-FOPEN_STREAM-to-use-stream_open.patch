Subject: [PATCH] fuse: Add FOPEN_STREAM to use stream_open()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.5
Git-commit: bbd84f33652f852ce5992d65db4d020aba21f882

commit bbd84f33652f852ce5992d65db4d020aba21f882 upstream.

Starting from commit 9c225f2655e3 ("vfs: atomic f_pos accesses as per
POSIX") files opened even via nonseekable_open gate read and write via lock
and do not allow them to be run simultaneously. This can create read vs
write deadlock if a filesystem is trying to implement a socket-like file
which is intended to be simultaneously used for both read and write from
filesystem client.  See commit 10dce8af3422 ("fs: stream_open - opener for
stream-like files so that read and write can run simultaneously without
deadlock") for details and e.g. commit 581d21a2d02a ("xenbus: fix deadlock
on writes to /proc/xen/xenbus") for a similar deadlock example on
/proc/xen/xenbus.

To avoid such deadlock it was tempting to adjust fuse_finish_open to use
stream_open instead of nonseekable_open on just FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE flags,
but grepping through Debian codesearch shows users of FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE,
and in particular GVFS which actually uses offset in its read and write
handlers

	https://codesearch.debian.net/search?q=-%3Enonseekable+%3D
	https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gvfs/blob/1.40.0-6-gcbc54396/client/gvfsfusedaemon.c#L1080
	https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gvfs/blob/1.40.0-6-gcbc54396/client/gvfsfusedaemon.c#L1247-1346
	https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gvfs/blob/1.40.0-6-gcbc54396/client/gvfsfusedaemon.c#L1399-1481

so if we would do such a change it will break a real user.

Add another flag (FOPEN_STREAM) for filesystem servers to indicate that the
opened handler is having stream-like semantics; does not use file position
and thus the kernel is free to issue simultaneous read and write request on
opened file handle.

This patch together with stream_open() should be added to stable kernels
starting from v3.14+. This will allow to patch OSSPD and other FUSE
filesystems that provide stream-like files to return FOPEN_STREAM |
FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE in open handler and this way avoid the deadlock on all
kernel versions. This should work because fuse_finish_open ignores unknown
open flags returned from a filesystem and so passing FOPEN_STREAM to a
kernel that is not aware of this flag cannot hurt. In turn the kernel that
is not aware of FOPEN_STREAM will be < v3.14 where just FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE
is sufficient to implement streams without read vs write deadlock.
