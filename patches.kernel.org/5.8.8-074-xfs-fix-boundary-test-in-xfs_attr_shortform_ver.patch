Subject: [PATCH] xfs: fix boundary test in xfs_attr_shortform_verify
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.8
Git-commit: f4020438fab05364018c91f7e02ebdd192085933

[ Upstream commit f4020438fab05364018c91f7e02ebdd192085933 ]

The boundary test for the fixed-offset parts of xfs_attr_sf_entry in
xfs_attr_shortform_verify is off by one, because the variable array
at the end is defined as nameval[1] not nameval[].
Hence we need to subtract 1 from the calculation.

This can be shown by:

# touch file
# setfattr -n root.a file

and verifications will fail when it's written to disk.

This only matters for a last attribute which has a single-byte name
and no value, otherwise the combination of namelen & valuelen will
push endp further out and this test won't fail.

Fixes: 1e1bbd8e7ee06 ("xfs: create structure verifier function for shortform xattrs")
