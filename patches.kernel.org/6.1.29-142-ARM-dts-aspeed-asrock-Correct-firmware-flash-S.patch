Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: aspeed: asrock: Correct firmware flash SPI clocks
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.29
Git-commit: 9dedb724446913ea7b1591b4b3d2e3e909090980

commit 9dedb724446913ea7b1591b4b3d2e3e909090980 upstream.

While I'm not aware of any problems that have occurred running these
at 100 MHz, the official word from ASRock is that 50 MHz is the
correct speed to use, so let's be safe and use that instead.
