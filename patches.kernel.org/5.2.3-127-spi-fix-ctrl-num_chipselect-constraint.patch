Subject: [PATCH] spi: fix ctrl->num_chipselect constraint
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.3
Git-commit: f9481b08220d7dc1ff21e296a330ee8b721b44e4

[ Upstream commit f9481b08220d7dc1ff21e296a330ee8b721b44e4 ]

at91sam9g25ek showed the following error at probe:
atmel_spi f0000000.spi: Using dma0chan2 (tx) and dma0chan3 (rx)
for DMA transfers
atmel_spi: probe of f0000000.spi failed with error -22

Commit 0a919ae49223 ("spi: Don't call spi_get_gpio_descs() before device name is set")
moved the calling of spi_get_gpio_descs() after ctrl->dev is set,
but didn't move the !ctrl->num_chipselect check. When there are
chip selects in the device tree, the spi-atmel driver lets the
SPI core discover them when registering the SPI master.
The ctrl->num_chipselect is thus expected to be set by
spi_get_gpio_descs().

Move the !ctlr->num_chipselect after spi_get_gpio_descs() as it was
before the aforementioned commit. While touching this block, get rid
of the explicit comparison with 0 and update the commenting style.
