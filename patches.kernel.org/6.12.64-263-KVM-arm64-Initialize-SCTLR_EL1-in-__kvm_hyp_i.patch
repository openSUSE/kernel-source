Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm64: Initialize SCTLR_EL1 in __kvm_hyp_init_cpu()
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.64
Git-commit: 3855a7b91d42ebf3513b7ccffc44807274978b3d

[ Upstream commit 3855a7b91d42ebf3513b7ccffc44807274978b3d ]

When KVM is in protected mode, host calls to PSCI are proxied via EL2,
and cold entries from CPU_ON, CPU_SUSPEND, and SYSTEM_SUSPEND bounce
through __kvm_hyp_init_cpu() at EL2 before entering the host kernel's
entry point at EL1. While __kvm_hyp_init_cpu() initializes SPSR_EL2 for
the exception return to EL1, it does not initialize SCTLR_EL1.

Due to this, it's possible to enter EL1 with SCTLR_EL1 in an UNKNOWN
state. In practice this has been seen to result in kernel crashes after
CPU_ON as a result of SCTLR_EL1.M being 1 in violation of the initial
core configuration specified by PSCI.

Fix this by initializing SCTLR_EL1 for cold entry to the host kernel.
As it's necessary to write to SCTLR_EL12 in VHE mode, this
initialization is moved into __kvm_host_psci_cpu_entry() where we can
use write_sysreg_el1().

The remnants of the '__init_el2_nvhe_prepare_eret' macro are folded into
its only caller, as this is clearer than having the macro.
