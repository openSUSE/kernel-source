Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: rt5682: Fix panic in rt5682_jack_detect_handler
 happening during system shutdown
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.3
Git-commit: 45a2702ce10993eda7a5b12690294782d565519c

[ Upstream commit 45a2702ce10993eda7a5b12690294782d565519c ]

During Coldboot stress tests, system encountered the following panic.
Panic logs depicts rt5682_i2c_shutdown() happened first and then later
jack detect handler workqueue function triggered.
This situation causes panic as rt5682_i2c_shutdown() resets codec.
Fix this panic by cancelling all jack detection delayed work.
