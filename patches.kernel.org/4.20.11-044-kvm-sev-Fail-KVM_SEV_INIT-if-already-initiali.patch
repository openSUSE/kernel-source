[ Upstream commit 3f14a89d1132dcae3c8ce6721c6ef51f6e6d9b5f ]

By code inspection, it was found that multiple calls to KVM_SEV_INIT
could deplete asid bits and overwrite kvm_sev_info's regions_list.

Multiple calls to KVM_SVM_INIT is not likely to occur with QEMU, but this
should likely be fixed anyway.

This code is serialized by kvm->lock.
