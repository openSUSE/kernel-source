Subject: [PATCH] ext4: work around deleting a file with i_nlink == 0 safely
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.4
Git-commit: c7df4a1ecb8579838ec8c56b2bb6a6716e974f37

commit c7df4a1ecb8579838ec8c56b2bb6a6716e974f37 upstream.

If the file system is corrupted such that a file's i_links_count is
too small, then it's possible that when unlinking that file, i_nlink
will already be zero.  Previously we were working around this kind of
corruption by forcing i_nlink to one; but we were doing this before
trying to delete the directory entry --- and if the file system is
corrupted enough that ext4_delete_entry() fails, then we exit with
i_nlink elevated, and this causes the orphan inode list handling to be
FUBAR'ed, such that when we unmount the file system, the orphan inode
list can get corrupted.

A better way to fix this is to simply skip trying to call drop_nlink()
if i_nlink is already zero, thus moving the check to the place where
it makes the most sense.
