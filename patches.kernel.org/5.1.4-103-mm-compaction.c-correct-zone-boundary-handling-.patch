Subject: [PATCH] mm/compaction.c: correct zone boundary handling when
 isolating pages from a pageblock
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.4
Git-commit: 60fce36afa9c77c7ccbf980c4f670f3be3651fce

There is no reproducer and it is difficult to hit -- 1 crash every few
days.  The issue is very similar to the fix in commit 6b0868c820ff
("mm/compaction.c: correct zone boundary handling when resetting pageblock
skip hints").  When isolating free pages around a target pageblock, the
boundary handling is off by one and can stray into the next pageblock.
Triggering the syzbot error requires that the end of pageblock is section
or zone aligned, and that the next section is unpopulated.

A more subtle consequence of the bug is that pageblocks were being
improperly used as migration targets which potentially hurts fragmentation
avoidance in the long-term one page at a time.

A debugging patch revealed that it's definitely possible to stray outside
of a pageblock which is not intended.  While syzbot cannot be used to
verify this patch, it was confirmed that the debugging warning no longer
triggers with this patch applied.  It has also been confirmed that the THP
allocation stress tests are not degraded by this patch.
