Subject: [PATCH] nvme-tcp: fix connect failure on receiving partial ICResp PDU
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.17
Git-commit: 578539e0969028f711c34d9a4565931edfe1d730

[ Upstream commit 578539e0969028f711c34d9a4565931edfe1d730 ]

nvme_tcp_init_connection() attempts to receive an ICResp PDU but only
checks that the return value from recvmsg() is non-negative. If the
sender closes the TCP connection or sends fewer than 128 bytes, this
check will pass even though the full PDU wasn't received.

Ensure the full ICResp PDU is received by checking that recvmsg()
returns the expected 128 bytes.

Additionally set the MSG_WAITALL flag for recvmsg(), as a sender could
split the ICResp over multiple TCP frames. Without MSG_WAITALL,
recvmsg() could return prematurely with only part of the PDU.
