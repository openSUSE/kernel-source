Subject: [PATCH] dmaengine: Fix a double free in dma_async_device_register
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.16
Git-commit: ea45b6008f8095db0cc09ad6e03c7785c2986197

[ Upstream commit ea45b6008f8095db0cc09ad6e03c7785c2986197 ]

In the first list_for_each_entry() macro of dma_async_device_register,
it gets the chan from list and calls __dma_async_device_channel_register
(..,chan). We can see that chan->local is allocated by alloc_percpu() and
it is freed chan->local by free_percpu(chan->local) when
__dma_async_device_channel_register() failed.

But after __dma_async_device_channel_register() failed, the caller will
goto err_out and freed the chan->local in the second time by free_percpu().

The cause of this problem is forget to set chan->local to NULL when
chan->local was freed in __dma_async_device_channel_register(). My
patch sets chan->local to NULL when the callee failed to avoid double free.
