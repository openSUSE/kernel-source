Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: SVM: don't passthrough SMAP/SMEP/PKE bits in !NPT
 && !gCR0.PG case
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.16.11
Git-commit: c53bbe2145f51d3bc0438c2db02e737b9b598bf3

commit c53bbe2145f51d3bc0438c2db02e737b9b598bf3 upstream.

When the guest doesn't enable paging, and NPT/EPT is disabled, we
use guest't paging CR3's as KVM's shadow paging pointer and
we are technically in direct mode as if we were to use NPT/EPT.

In direct mode we create SPTEs with user mode permissions
because usually in the direct mode the NPT/EPT doesn't
need to restrict access based on guest CPL
(there are MBE/GMET extenstions for that but KVM doesn't use them).

In this special "use guest paging as direct" mode however,
and if CR4.SMAP/CR4.SMEP are enabled, that will make the CPU
fault on each access and KVM will enter endless loop of page faults.

Since page protection doesn't have any meaning in !PG case,
just don't passthrough these bits.

The fix is the same as was done for VMX in commit:
commit 656ec4a4928a ("KVM: VMX: fix SMEP and SMAP without EPT")

This fixes the boot of windows 10 without NPT for good.
(Without this patch, BSP boots, but APs were stuck in endless
loop of page faults, causing the VM boot with 1 CPU)
