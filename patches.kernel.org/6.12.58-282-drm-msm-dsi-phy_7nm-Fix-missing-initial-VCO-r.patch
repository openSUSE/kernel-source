Subject: [PATCH] drm/msm/dsi/phy_7nm: Fix missing initial VCO rate
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.58
Git-commit: 5ddcb0cb9d10e6e70a68e0cb8f0b8e3a7eb8ccaf

[ Upstream commit 5ddcb0cb9d10e6e70a68e0cb8f0b8e3a7eb8ccaf ]

Driver unconditionally saves current state on first init in
dsi_pll_7nm_init(), but does not save the VCO rate, only some of the
divider registers.  The state is then restored during probe/enable via
msm_dsi_phy_enable() -> msm_dsi_phy_pll_restore_state() ->
dsi_7nm_pll_restore_state().

Restoring calls dsi_pll_7nm_vco_set_rate() with
pll_7nm->vco_current_rate=0, which basically overwrites existing rate of
VCO and messes with clock hierarchy, by setting frequency to 0 to clock
tree.  This makes anyway little sense - VCO rate was not saved, so
should not be restored.

If PLL was not configured configure it to minimum rate to avoid glitches
and configuring entire in clock hierarchy to 0 Hz.
