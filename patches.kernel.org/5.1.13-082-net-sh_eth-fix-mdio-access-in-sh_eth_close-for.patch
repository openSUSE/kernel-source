Subject: [PATCH] net: sh_eth: fix mdio access in sh_eth_close() for R-Car Gen2
 and RZ/A1 SoCs
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.13
Git-commit: 315ca92dd863fecbffc0bb52ae0ac11e0398726a

[ Upstream commit 315ca92dd863fecbffc0bb52ae0ac11e0398726a ]

The sh_eth_close() resets the MAC and then calls phy_stop()
so that mdio read access result is incorrect without any error
according to kernel trace like below:

ifconfig-216   [003] .n..   109.133124: mdio_access: ee700000.ethernet-ffffffff read  phy:0x01 reg:0x00 val:0xffff

According to the hardware manual, the RMII mode should be set to 1
before operation the Ethernet MAC. However, the previous code was not
set to 1 after the driver issued the soft_reset in sh_eth_dev_exit()
so that the mdio read access result seemed incorrect. To fix the issue,
this patch adds a condition and set the RMII mode register in
sh_eth_dev_exit() for R-Car Gen2 and RZ/A1 SoCs.

Note that when I have tried to move the sh_eth_dev_exit() calling
after phy_stop() on sh_eth_close(), but it gets worse (kernel panic
happened and it seems that a register is accessed while the clock is
off).
