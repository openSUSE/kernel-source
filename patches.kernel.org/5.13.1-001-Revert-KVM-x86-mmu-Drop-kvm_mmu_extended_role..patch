Subject: [PATCH] Revert "KVM: x86/mmu: Drop kvm_mmu_extended_role.cr4_la57
 hack"
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.1
Git-commit: f71a53d1180d5ecc346f0c6a23191d837fe2871b

commit f71a53d1180d5ecc346f0c6a23191d837fe2871b upstream.

Restore CR4.LA57 to the mmu_role to fix an amusing edge case with nested
virtualization.  When KVM (L0) is using TDP, CR4.LA57 is not reflected in
mmu_role.base.level because that tracks the shadow root level, i.e. TDP
level.  Normally, this is not an issue because LA57 can't be toggled
while long mode is active, i.e. the guest has to first disable paging,
then toggle LA57, then re-enable paging, thus ensuring an MMU
reinitialization.

But if L1 is crafty, it can load a new CR4 on VM-Exit and toggle LA57
without having to bounce through an unpaged section.  L1 can also load a
new CR3 on exit, i.e. it doesn't even need to play crazy paging games, a
single entry PML5 is sufficient.  Such shenanigans are only problematic
if L0 and L1 use TDP, otherwise L1 and L2 share an MMU that gets
reinitialized on nested VM-Enter/VM-Exit due to mmu_role.base.guest_mode.

Note, in the L2 case with nested TDP, even though L1 can switch between
L2s with different LA57 settings, thus bypassing the paging requirement,
in that case KVM's nested_mmu will track LA57 in base.level.

This reverts commit 8053f924cad30bf9f9a24e02b6c8ddfabf5202ea.
