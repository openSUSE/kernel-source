Subject: [PATCH] s390/mm: fix panic in gup_fast on large pud
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.9
Git-commit: 582b4e55403e053d8a48ff687a05174da9cc3fb0

commit 582b4e55403e053d8a48ff687a05174da9cc3fb0 upstream.

On s390 there currently is no implementation of pud_write(). That was ok
as long as we had our own implementation of get_user_pages_fast() which
checked for pud protection by testing the bit directly w/o using
pud_write(). The other callers of pud_write() are not reachable on s390.

After commit 1a42010cdc26 ("s390/mm: convert to the generic
get_user_pages_fast code") we use the generic get_user_pages_fast(), which
does call pud_write() in pud_access_permitted() for FOLL_WRITE access on
a large pud. Without an s390 specific pud_write(), the generic version is
called, which contains a BUG() statement to remind us that we don't have a
proper implementation. This results in a kernel panic.

Fix this by providing an implementation of pud_write().
