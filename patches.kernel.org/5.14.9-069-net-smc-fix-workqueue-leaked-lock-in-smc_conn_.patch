Subject: [PATCH] net/smc: fix 'workqueue leaked lock' in smc_conn_abort_work
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.9
Git-commit: a18cee4791b1123d0a6579a7c89f4b87e48abe03

[ Upstream commit a18cee4791b1123d0a6579a7c89f4b87e48abe03 ]

The abort_work is scheduled when a connection was detected to be
out-of-sync after a link failure. The work calls smc_conn_kill(),
which calls smc_close_active_abort() and that might end up calling
smc_close_cancel_work().
smc_close_cancel_work() cancels any pending close_work and tx_work but
needs to release the sock_lock before and acquires the sock_lock again
afterwards. So when the sock_lock was NOT acquired before then it may
be held after the abort_work completes. Thats why the sock_lock is
acquired before the call to smc_conn_kill() in __smc_lgr_terminate(),
but this is missing in smc_conn_abort_work().

Fix that by acquiring the sock_lock first and release it after the
call to smc_conn_kill().
