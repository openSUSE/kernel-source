Subject: [PATCH] media: redrat3: use int type to store negative error codes
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.58
Git-commit: ecba852dc9f4993f4f894ea1f352564560e19a3e

[ Upstream commit ecba852dc9f4993f4f894ea1f352564560e19a3e ]

Change "ret" from u8 to int type in redrat3_enable_detector() to store
negative error codes or zero returned by redrat3_send_cmd() and
usb_submit_urb() - this better aligns with the coding standards and
maintains code consistency.

No effect on runtime.
