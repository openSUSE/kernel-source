Subject: [PATCH] ptr_ring: add barriers
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.11
Git-commit: a8ceb5dbfde1092b466936bca0ff3be127ecf38e

[ Upstream commit a8ceb5dbfde1092b466936bca0ff3be127ecf38e ]

Users of ptr_ring expect that it's safe to give the
data structure a pointer and have it be available
to consumers, but that actually requires an smb_wmb
or a stronger barrier.

In absence of such barriers and on architectures that reorder writes,
consumer might read an un=initialized value from an skb pointer stored
in the skb array.  This was observed causing crashes.

To fix, add memory barriers.  The barrier we use is a wmb, the
assumption being that producers do not need to read the value so we do
not need to order these reads.
