Subject: [PATCH] ext4: don't complain about incorrect features when probing
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.13
Git-commit: 0d9366d67bcf066b028e57d09c9a86ce879bcc28

[ Upstream commit 0d9366d67bcf066b028e57d09c9a86ce879bcc28 ]

If mount is auto-probing for filesystem type, it will try various
filesystems in order, with the MS_SILENT flag set.  We get
that flag as the silent arg to ext4_fill_super.

If we're probing (silent==1) then don't complain about feature
incompatibilities that are found if it looks like it's actually
a different valid extN type - failed probes should be silent
in this case.

If the on-disk features are unknown even to ext4, then complain.
