Subject: [PATCH] mm: page_mkclean vs MADV_DONTNEED race
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.10
Git-commit: 024eee0e83f0df52317be607ca521e0fc572aa07

[ Upstream commit 024eee0e83f0df52317be607ca521e0fc572aa07 ]

MADV_DONTNEED is handled with mmap_sem taken in read mode.  We call
page_mkclean without holding mmap_sem.

MADV_DONTNEED implies that pages in the region are unmapped and subsequent
access to the pages in that range is handled as a new page fault.  This
implies that if we don't have parallel access to the region when
MADV_DONTNEED is run we expect those range to be unallocated.

w.r.t page_mkclean() we need to make sure that we don't break the
MADV_DONTNEED semantics.  MADV_DONTNEED check for pmd_none without holding
pmd_lock.  This implies we skip the pmd if we temporarily mark pmd none.
Avoid doing that while marking the page clean.

Keep the sequence same for dax too even though we don't support
MADV_DONTNEED for dax mapping

The bug was noticed by code review and I didn't observe any failures w.r.t
test run.  This is similar to
