Subject: [PATCH] cifs: generate signkey for the channel that's reconnecting
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.21
Git-commit: 05ce0448c3f36febd8db0ee0e9e16557f3ab5ee8

commit 05ce0448c3f36febd8db0ee0e9e16557f3ab5ee8 upstream.

Before my changes to how multichannel reconnects work, the
primary channel was always used to do a non-binding session
setup. With my changes, that is not the case anymore.
Missed this place where channel at index 0 was forcibly
updated with the signing key.
