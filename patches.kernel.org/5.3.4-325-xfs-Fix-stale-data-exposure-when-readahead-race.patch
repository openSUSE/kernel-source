Subject: [PATCH] xfs: Fix stale data exposure when readahead races with hole
 punch
References: bnc#1151927
Patch-mainline: 5.3.4
Git-commit: 40144e49ff84c3bd6bd091b58115257670be8803

commit 40144e49ff84c3bd6bd091b58115257670be8803 upstream.

Hole puching currently evicts pages from page cache and then goes on to
remove blocks from the inode. This happens under both XFS_IOLOCK_EXCL
and XFS_MMAPLOCK_EXCL which provides appropriate serialization with
racing reads or page faults. However there is currently nothing that
prevents readahead triggered by fadvise() or madvise() from racing with
the hole punch and instantiating page cache page after hole punching has
evicted page cache in xfs_flush_unmap_range() but before it has removed
blocks from the inode. This page cache page will be mapping soon to be
freed block and that can lead to returning stale data to userspace or
even filesystem corruption.

Fix the problem by protecting handling of readahead requests by
XFS_IOLOCK_SHARED similarly as we protect reads.
