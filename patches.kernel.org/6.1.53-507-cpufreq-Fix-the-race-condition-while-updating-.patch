Subject: [PATCH] cpufreq: Fix the race condition while updating the
 transition_task of policy
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.53
Git-commit: 61bfbf7951ba561dcbdd5357702d3cbc2d447812

[ Upstream commit 61bfbf7951ba561dcbdd5357702d3cbc2d447812 ]

The field 'transition_task' of policy structure is used to track the
task which is performing the frequency transition. Using this field to
print a warning once detect a case where the same task is calling
_begin() again before completing the preivous frequency transition via
the _end().

However, there is a potential race condition in _end() and _begin() APIs
while updating the field 'transition_task' of policy, the scenario is
depicted below:

             Task A                            Task B

        /* 1st freq transition */
        Invoke _begin() {
                ...
                ...
        }
                                        /* 2nd freq transition */
                                        Invoke _begin() {
                                                ... //waiting for A to
                                                ... //clear
                                                ... //transition_ongoing
                                                ... //in _end() for
                                                ... //the 1st transition
                                                        |
        Change the frequency                            |
                                                        |
        Invoke _end() {                                 |
                ...                                     |
                ...                                     |
                transition_ongoing = false;             V
                                                transition_ongoing = true;
                                                transition_task = current;
                transition_task = NULL;
                ... //A overwrites the task
                ... //performing the transition
                ... //result in error warning.
        }

To fix this race condition, the transition_lock of policy structure is
now acquired before updating policy structure in _end() API. Which ensure
that only one task can update the 'transition_task' field at a time.
