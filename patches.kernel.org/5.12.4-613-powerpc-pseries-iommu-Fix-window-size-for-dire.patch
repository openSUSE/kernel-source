Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/pseries/iommu: Fix window size for direct mapping
 with pmem
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.4
Git-commit: a9d2f9bb225fd2a764aef57738ab6c7f38d782ae

[ Upstream commit a9d2f9bb225fd2a764aef57738ab6c7f38d782ae ]

As of today, if the DDW is big enough to fit (1 << MAX_PHYSMEM_BITS)
it's possible to use direct DMA mapping even with pmem region.

But, if that happens, the window size (len) is set to (MAX_PHYSMEM_BITS
- page_shift) instead of MAX_PHYSMEM_BITS, causing a pagesize times
smaller DDW to be created, being insufficient for correct usage.

Fix this so the correct window size is used in this case.
