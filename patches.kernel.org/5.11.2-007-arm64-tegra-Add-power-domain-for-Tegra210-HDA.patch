Subject: [PATCH] arm64: tegra: Add power-domain for Tegra210 HDA
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.2
Git-commit: 1e0ca5467445bc1f41a9e403d6161a22f313dae7

commit 1e0ca5467445bc1f41a9e403d6161a22f313dae7 upstream.

HDA initialization is failing occasionally on Tegra210 and following
print is observed in the boot log. Because of this probe() fails and
no sound card is registered.

  [16.800802] tegra-hda 70030000.hda: no codecs found!

Codecs request a state change and enumeration by the controller. In
failure cases this does not seem to happen as STATETS register reads 0.

The problem seems to be related to the HDA codec dependency on SOR
power domain. If it is gated during HDA probe then the failure is
observed. Building Tegra HDA driver into kernel image avoids this
failure but does not completely address the dependency part. Fix this
problem by adding 'power-domains' DT property for Tegra210 HDA. Note
that Tegra186 and Tegra194 HDA do this already.
