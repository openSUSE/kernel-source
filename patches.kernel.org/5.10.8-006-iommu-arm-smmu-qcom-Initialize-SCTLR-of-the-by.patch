Subject: [PATCH] iommu/arm-smmu-qcom: Initialize SCTLR of the bypass context
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.8
Git-commit: aded8c7c2b72f846a07a2c736b8e75bb8cf50a87

[ Upstream commit aded8c7c2b72f846a07a2c736b8e75bb8cf50a87 ]

On SM8150 it's occasionally observed that the boot hangs in between the
writing of SMEs and context banks in arm_smmu_device_reset().

The problem seems to coincide with a display refresh happening after
updating the stream mapping, but before clearing - and there by
disabling translation - the context bank picked to emulate translation
bypass.

Resolve this by explicitly disabling the bypass context already in
cfg_probe.
