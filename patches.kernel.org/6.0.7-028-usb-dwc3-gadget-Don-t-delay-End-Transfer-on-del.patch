Subject: [PATCH] usb: dwc3: gadget: Don't delay End Transfer on delayed_status
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.7
Git-commit: 4db0fbb601361767144e712beb96704b966339f5

commit 4db0fbb601361767144e712beb96704b966339f5 upstream.

The gadget driver may wait on the request completion when it sets the
USB_GADGET_DELAYED_STATUS. Make sure that the End Transfer command can
go through if the dwc->delayed_status is set so that the request can
complete. When the delayed_status is set, the Setup packet is already
processed, and the next phase should be either Data or Status. It's
unlikely that the host would cancel the control transfer and send a new
Setup packet during End Transfer command. But if that's the case, we can
try again when ep0state returns to EP0_SETUP_PHASE.
