Subject: [PATCH] arm: spear13xx: Fix dmas cells
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.5
Git-commit: cdd10409914184c7eee5ae3e11beb890c9c16c61

commit cdd10409914184c7eee5ae3e11beb890c9c16c61 upstream.

The "dmas" cells for the designware DMA controller need to have only 3
properties apart from the phandle: request line, src master and
destination master. But the commit 6e8887f60f60 updated it incorrectly
while moving from platform code to DT. Fix it.

Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org # v3.10+
Fixes: 6e8887f60f60 ("ARM: SPEAr13xx: Pass generic DW DMAC platform data from DT")
