Subject: [PATCH] xhci: Don't show warning for reinit on known broken suspend
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.3
Git-commit: 484d6f7aa3283d082c87654b7fe7a7f725423dfb

[ Upstream commit 484d6f7aa3283d082c87654b7fe7a7f725423dfb ]

commit 8b328f8002bc ("xhci: re-initialize the HC during resume if HCE was
set") introduced a new warning message when the host controller error
was set and re-initializing.

This is expected behavior on some designs which already set
`xhci->broken_suspend` so the new warning is alarming to some users.

Modify the code to only show the warning if this was a surprising behavior
to the XHCI driver.
