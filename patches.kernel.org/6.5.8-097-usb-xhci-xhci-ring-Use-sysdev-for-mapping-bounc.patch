Subject: [PATCH] usb: xhci: xhci-ring: Use sysdev for mapping bounce buffer
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.8
Git-commit: 41a43013d2366db5b88b42bbcd8e8f040b6ccf21

commit 41a43013d2366db5b88b42bbcd8e8f040b6ccf21 upstream.

As mentioned in:
  commit 474ed23a6257 ("xhci: align the last trb before link if it is
easily splittable.")

A bounce buffer is utilized for ensuring that transfers that span across
ring segments are aligned to the EP's max packet size.  However, the device
that is used to map the DMA buffer to is currently using the XHCI HCD,
which does not carry any DMA operations in certain configrations.
Migration to using the sysdev entry was introduced for DWC3 based
implementations where the IOMMU operations are present.

Replace the reference to the controller device to sysdev instead.  This
allows the bounce buffer to be properly mapped to any implementations that
have an IOMMU involved.
