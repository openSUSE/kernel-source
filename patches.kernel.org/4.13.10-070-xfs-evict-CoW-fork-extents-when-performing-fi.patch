Subject: [PATCH] xfs: evict CoW fork extents when performing finsert/fcollapse
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.13.10
Git-commit: 3af423b03435c81036fa710623d3ae92fbe346a3

commit 3af423b03435c81036fa710623d3ae92fbe346a3 upstream.

When we perform an finsert/fcollapse operation, cancel all the CoW
extents for the affected file offset range so that they don't end up
pointing to the wrong blocks.
