Subject: [PATCH] of: of_mdio: Correct loop scanning logic
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.7
Git-commit: 5a8d7f126c97d04d893f5e5be2b286437a0d01b0

[ Upstream commit 5a8d7f126c97d04d893f5e5be2b286437a0d01b0 ]

Commit 209c65b61d94 ("drivers/of/of_mdio.c:fix of_mdiobus_register()")
introduced a break of the loop on the premise that a successful
registration should exit the loop. The premise is correct but not to
code, because rc && rc != -ENODEV is just a special error condition,
that means we would exit the loop even with rc == -ENODEV which is
absolutely not correct since this is the error code to indicate to the
MDIO bus layer that scanning should continue.

Fix this by explicitly checking for rc = 0 as the only valid condition
to break out of the loop.
