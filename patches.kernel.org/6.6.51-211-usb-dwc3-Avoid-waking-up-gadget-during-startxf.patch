Subject: [PATCH] usb: dwc3: Avoid waking up gadget during startxfer
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.51
Git-commit: 00dcf2fa449f23a263343d7fe051741bdde65d0b

commit 00dcf2fa449f23a263343d7fe051741bdde65d0b upstream.

When operating in High-Speed, it is observed that DSTS[USBLNKST] doesn't
update link state immediately after receiving the wakeup interrupt. Since
wakeup event handler calls the resume callbacks, there is a chance that
function drivers can perform an ep queue, which in turn tries to perform
remote wakeup from send_gadget_ep_cmd(STARTXFER). This happens because
DSTS[[21:18] wasn't updated to U0 yet, it's observed that the latency of
DSTS can be in order of milli-seconds. Hence avoid calling gadget_wakeup
during startxfer to prevent unnecessarily issuing remote wakeup to host.

+ * command timeout set by driver. No additional step is needed.
+ *
+ * For L2 or U3 link state, the gadget is in USB suspend. Care should be
+ * taken when sending Start Transfer command to ensure that it's done after
+ * USB resume.
