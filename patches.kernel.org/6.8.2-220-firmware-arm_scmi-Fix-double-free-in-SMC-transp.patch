Subject: [PATCH] firmware: arm_scmi: Fix double free in SMC transport cleanup
 path
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.2
Git-commit: f1d71576d2c9ec8fdb822173fa7f3de79475e9bd

[ Upstream commit f1d71576d2c9ec8fdb822173fa7f3de79475e9bd ]

When the generic SCMI code tears down a channel, it calls the chan_free
callback function, defined by each transport. Since multiple protocols
might share the same transport_info member, chan_free() might want to
clean up the same member multiple times within the given SCMI transport
implementation. In this case, it is SMC transport. This will lead to a NULL
pointer dereference at the second time:

Simply check for the struct pointer being NULL before trying to access
its members, to avoid this situation.

This was found when a transport doesn't really work (for instance no SMC
service), the probe routines then tries to clean up, and triggers a crash.
