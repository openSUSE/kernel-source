Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: pvclock: Handle first-time write to pvclock-page
 contains random junk

commit 51c4b8bba674cfd2260d173602c4dac08e4c3a99 upstream.

When guest passes KVM it's pvclock-page GPA via WRMSR to
MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME / MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME_NEW, KVM don't initialize
pvclock-page to some start-values. It just requests a clock-update which
will happen before entering to guest.

The clock-update logic will call kvm_setup_pvclock_page() to update the
pvclock-page with info. However, kvm_setup_pvclock_page() *wrongly*
assumes that the version-field is initialized to an even number. This is
wrong because at first-time write, field could be any-value.

Fix simply makes sure that if first-time version-field is odd, increment
it once more to make it even and only then start standard logic.
This follows same logic as done in other pvclock shared-pages (See
kvm_write_wall_clock() and record_steal_time()).
