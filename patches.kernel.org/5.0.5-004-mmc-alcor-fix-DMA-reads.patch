Subject: [PATCH] mmc: alcor: fix DMA reads
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.5
Git-commit: 5ea47691bd99e1100707ec63364aff72324e2af4

commit 5ea47691bd99e1100707ec63364aff72324e2af4 upstream.

Setting max_blk_count to 1 here was causing the mmc block layer
to always use the MMC_READ_SINGLE_BLOCK command here, which the
driver does not DMA-accelerate.

Drop the max_blk_ settings here. The mmc host defaults suffice,
along with the max_segs and max_seg_size settings, which I have
now documented in more detail.

Now each MMC command reads 4 512-byte blocks, using DMA instead of
PIO. On my SD card, this increases read performance (measured with dd)
from 167kb/sec to 4.6mb/sec.
