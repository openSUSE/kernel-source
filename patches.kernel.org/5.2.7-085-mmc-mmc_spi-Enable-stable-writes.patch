Subject: [PATCH] mmc: mmc_spi: Enable stable writes
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.7
Git-commit: 3a6ffb3c8c3274a39dc8f2514526e645c5d21753

commit 3a6ffb3c8c3274a39dc8f2514526e645c5d21753 upstream.

While using the mmc_spi driver occasionally errors like this popped up:

mmcblk0: error -84 transferring data end_request: I/O error, dev mmcblk0, sector 581756

I looked on the Internet for occurrences of the same problem and came
across a helpful post [1]. It includes source code to reproduce the bug.
There is also an analysis about the cause. During transmission data in the
supplied buffer is being modified. Thus the previously calculated checksum
is not correct anymore.

After some digging I found out that device drivers are supposed to report
they need stable writes. To fix this I set the appropriate flag at queue
initialization if CRC checksumming is enabled for that SPI host.
