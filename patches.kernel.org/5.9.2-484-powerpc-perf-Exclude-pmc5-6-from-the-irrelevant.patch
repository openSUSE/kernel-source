Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/perf: Exclude pmc5/6 from the irrelevant PMU group
 constraints
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.2
Git-commit: 3b6c3adbb2fa42749c3d38cfc4d4d0b7e096bb7b

[ Upstream commit 3b6c3adbb2fa42749c3d38cfc4d4d0b7e096bb7b ]

PMU counter support functions enforces event constraints for group of
events to check if all events in a group can be monitored. Incase of
event codes using PMC5 and PMC6 ( 500fa and 600f4 respectively ), not
all constraints are applicable, say the threshold or sample bits. But
current code includes pmc5 and pmc6 in some group constraints (like
IC_DC Qualifier bits) which is actually not applicable and hence
results in those events not getting counted when scheduled along with
group of other events. Patch fixes this by excluding PMC5/6 from
constraints which are not relevant for it.
