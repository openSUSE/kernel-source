Subject: [PATCH] mm, slab: fix sign conversion problem in
 memcg_uncharge_slab()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.7
Git-commit: d7670879c5c4aa443d518fb234a9e5f30931efa3

commit d7670879c5c4aa443d518fb234a9e5f30931efa3 upstream.

It was found that running the LTP test on a PowerPC system could produce
erroneous values in /proc/meminfo, like:

  MemTotal:       531915072 kB
  MemFree:        507962176 kB
  MemAvailable:   1100020596352 kB

Using bisection, the problem is tracked down to commit 9c315e4d7d8c ("mm:
memcg/slab: cache page number in memcg_(un)charge_slab()").

In memcg_uncharge_slab() with a "int order" argument:

  unsigned int nr_pages = 1 << order;
    :
  mod_lruvec_state(lruvec, cache_vmstat_idx(s), -nr_pages);

The mod_lruvec_state() function will eventually call the
__mod_zone_page_state() which accepts a long argument.  Depending on the
compiler and how inlining is done, "-nr_pages" may be treated as a
negative number or a very large positive number.  Apparently, it was
treated as a large positive number in that PowerPC system leading to
incorrect stat counts.  This problem hasn't been seen in x86-64 yet,
perhaps the gcc compiler there has some slight difference in behavior.

It is fixed by making nr_pages a signed value.  For consistency, a similar
change is applied to memcg_charge_slab() as well.
