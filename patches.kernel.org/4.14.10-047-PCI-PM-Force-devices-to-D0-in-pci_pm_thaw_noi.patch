Subject: [PATCH] PCI / PM: Force devices to D0 in pci_pm_thaw_noirq()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.10
Git-commit: 5839ee7389e893a31e4e3c9cf17b50d14103c902

commit 5839ee7389e893a31e4e3c9cf17b50d14103c902 upstream.

It is incorrect to call pci_restore_state() for devices in low-power
states (D1-D3), as that involves the restoration of MSI setup which
requires MMIO to be operational and that is only the case in D0.

However, pci_pm_thaw_noirq() may do that if the driver's "freeze"
callbacks put the device into a low-power state, so fix it by making
it force devices into D0 via pci_set_power_state() instead of trying
to "update" their power state which is pointless.
