Subject: [PATCH] xhci: hisilicon: fix refercence leak in xhci_histb_probe
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.9
Git-commit: 76255470ffa2795a44032e8b3c1ced11d81aa2db

commit 76255470ffa2795a44032e8b3c1ced11d81aa2db upstream.

pm_runtime_get_sync() will increment pm usage at first and it
will resume the device later. We should decrease the usage count
whetever it succeeded or failed(maybe runtime of the device has
error, or device is in inaccessible state, or other error state).
If we do not call put operation to decrease the reference, it will
result in reference leak in xhci_histb_probe. Moreover, this
device cannot enter the idle state and always stay busy or other
non-idle state later. So we fixed it by jumping to error handling
branch.
