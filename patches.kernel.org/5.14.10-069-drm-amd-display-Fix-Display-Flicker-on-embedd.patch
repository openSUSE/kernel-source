Subject: [PATCH] drm/amd/display: Fix Display Flicker on embedded panels
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.10
Git-commit: 083fa05bbaf65a01866b5440031c822e32ad7510

commit 083fa05bbaf65a01866b5440031c822e32ad7510 upstream.

[Why]
ASSR is dependent on Signed PSP Verstage to enable Content
Protection for eDP panels. Unsigned PSP verstage is used
during development phase causing ASSR to FAIL.
As a result, link training is performed with
DP_PANEL_MODE_DEFAULT instead of DP_PANEL_MODE_EDP for
eDP panels that causes display flicker on some panels.

[How]
- Do not change panel mode, if ASSR is disabled
- Just report and continue to perform eDP link training
with right settings further.
