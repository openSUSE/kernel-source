Subject: [PATCH] serial: sc16is7xx: fix broken port 0 uart init

commit 2861ed4d6e6d1a2c9de9bf5b0abd996c2dc673d0 upstream.

The sc16is7xx_config_rs485() function is called only for the second
port (index 1, channel B), causing initialization problems for the
first port.

For the sc16is7xx driver, port->membase and port->mapbase are not set,
and their default values are 0. And we set port->iobase to the device
index. This means that when the first device is registered using the
uart_add_one_port() function, the following values will be in the port
structure:
    port->membase = 0
    port->mapbase = 0
    port->iobase  = 0

Therefore, the function uart_configure_port() in serial_core.c will
exit early because of the following check:
	/*
	 * If there isn't a port here, don't do anything further.
	 */
	if (!port->iobase && !port->mapbase && !port->membase)
		return;

Typically, I2C and SPI drivers do not set port->membase and
port->mapbase.

The max310x driver sets port->membase to ~0 (all ones). By
implementing the same change in this driver, uart_configure_port() is
now correctly executed for all ports.
