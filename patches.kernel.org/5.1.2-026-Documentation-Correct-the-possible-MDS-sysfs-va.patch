Subject: [PATCH] Documentation: Correct the possible MDS sysfs values
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.2
Git-commit: ea01668f9f43021b28b3f4d5ffad50106a1e1301

commit ea01668f9f43021b28b3f4d5ffad50106a1e1301 upstream

Adjust the last two rows in the table that display possible values when
MDS mitigation is enabled. They both were slightly innacurate.

In addition, convert the table of possible values and their descriptions
to a list-table. The simple table format uses the top border of equals
signs to determine cell width which resulted in the first column being
far too wide in comparison to the second column that contained the
majority of the text.
