Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: iterate all devices during trim, instead of
 fs_devices::alloc_list
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.2
Git-commit: d4e329de5e5e21594df2e0dd59da9acee71f133b

commit d4e329de5e5e21594df2e0dd59da9acee71f133b upstream.

btrfs_trim_fs iterates over the fs_devices->alloc_list while holding the
device_list_mutex.  The problem is that ->alloc_list is protected by the
chunk mutex.  We don't want to hold the chunk mutex over the trim of the
entire file system.  Fortunately, the ->dev_list list is protected by
the dev_list mutex and while it will give us all devices, including
read-only devices, we already just skip the read-only devices.  Then we
can continue to take and release the chunk mutex while scanning each
device.

Fixes: 499f377f49f ("btrfs: iterate over unused chunk space in FITRIM")
