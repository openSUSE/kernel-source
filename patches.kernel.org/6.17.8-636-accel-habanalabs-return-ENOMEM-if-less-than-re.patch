Subject: [PATCH] accel/habanalabs: return ENOMEM if less than requested pages
 were pinned
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.8
Git-commit: 9f5067531c9b79318c4e48a933cb2694f53f3de2

[ Upstream commit 9f5067531c9b79318c4e48a933cb2694f53f3de2 ]

EFAULT is currently returned if less than requested user pages are
pinned. This value means a "bad address" which might be confusing to
the user, as the address of the given user memory is not necessarily
"bad".

Modify the return value to ENOMEM, as "out of memory" is more suitable
in this case.
