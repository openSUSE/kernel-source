Subject: [PATCH] net: sched: report if filter is too large to dump
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.8
Git-commit: 5ae437ad5a2ed573b1ebb04e0afa70b8869f88dd

[ Upstream commit 5ae437ad5a2ed573b1ebb04e0afa70b8869f88dd ]

So far, if the filter was too large to fit in the allocated skb, the
kernel did not return any error and stopped dumping. Modify the dumper
so that it returns -EMSGSIZE when a filter fails to dump and it is the
first filter in the skb. If we are not first, we will get a next chance
with more room.

I understand this is pretty near to being an API change, but the
original design (silent truncation) can be considered a bug.

Note: The error case can happen pretty easily if you create a filter
with 32 actions and have 4kb pages. Also recent versions of iproute try
to be clever with their buffer allocation size, which in turn leads to
