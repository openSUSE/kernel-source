Subject: [PATCH] MIPS: Avoid VDSO ABI breakage due to global register variable
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.9
Git-commit: bbcc5672b0063b0e9d65dc8787a4f09c3b5bb5cc

commit bbcc5672b0063b0e9d65dc8787a4f09c3b5bb5cc upstream.

Declaring __current_thread_info as a global register variable has the
effect of preventing GCC from saving & restoring its value in cases
where the ABI would typically do so.

To quote GCC documentation:

> If the register is a call-saved register, call ABI is affected: the
> register will not be restored in function epilogue sequences after the
> variable has been assigned. Therefore, functions cannot safely return
> to callers that assume standard ABI.

When our position independent VDSO is built for the n32 or n64 ABIs all
functions it exposes should be preserving the value of $gp/$28 for their
caller, but in the presence of the __current_thread_info global register
variable GCC stops doing so & simply clobbers $gp/$28 when calculating
the address of the GOT.

In cases where the VDSO returns success this problem will typically be
masked by the caller in libc returning & restoring $gp/$28 itself, but
that is by no means guaranteed. In cases where the VDSO returns an error
libc will typically contain a fallback path which will now fail
(typically with a bad memory access) if it attempts anything which
relies upon the value of $gp/$28 - eg. accessing anything via the GOT.

One fix for this would be to move the declaration of
__current_thread_info inside the current_thread_info() function,
demoting it from global register variable to local register variable &
avoiding inadvertently creating a non-standard calling ABI for the VDSO.
Unfortunately this causes issues for clang, which doesn't support local
register variables as pointed out by commit fe92da0f355e ("MIPS: Changed
current_thread_info() to an equivalent supported by both clang and GCC")
which introduced the global register variable before we had a VDSO to
worry about.

Instead, fix this by continuing to use the global register variable for
the kernel proper but declare __current_thread_info as a simple extern
variable when building the VDSO. It should never be referenced, and will
cause a link error if it is. This resolves the calling convention issue
for the VDSO without having any impact upon the build of the kernel
itself for either clang or gcc.
