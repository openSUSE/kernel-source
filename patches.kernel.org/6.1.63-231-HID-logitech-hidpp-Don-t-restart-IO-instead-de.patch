Subject: [PATCH] HID: logitech-hidpp: Don't restart IO, instead defer
 hid_connect() only
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.63
Git-commit: 11ca0322a41920df2b462d2e45b0731e47ff475b

[ Upstream commit 11ca0322a41920df2b462d2e45b0731e47ff475b ]

Restarting IO causes 2 problems:

1. Some devices do not like IO being restarted this was addressed in
   commit 498ba2069035 ("HID: logitech-hidpp: Don't restart communication
   if not necessary"), but that change has issues of its own and needs to
   be reverted.

2. Restarting IO and specifically calling hid_device_io_stop() causes
   received packets to be missed, which may cause connect-events to
   get missed.

Restarting IO was introduced in commit 91cf9a98ae41 ("HID: logitech-hidpp:
make .probe usbhid capable") to allow to retrieve the device's name and
serial number and store these in hdev->name and hdev->uniq before
connecting any hid subdrivers (hid-input, hidraw) exporting this info
to userspace.

But this does not require restarting IO, this merely requires deferring
calling hid_connect(). Calling hid_hw_start() with a connect-mask of
0 makes it skip calling hid_connect(), so hidpp_probe() can simply call
hid_connect() later without needing to restart IO.

Remove the stop + restart of IO and instead just call hid_connect() later
to avoid the issues caused by restarting IO.

Now that IO is no longer stopped, hid_hw_close() must be called at the end
of probe() to balance the hid_hw_open() done at the beginning probe().

This series has been tested on the following devices:
Logitech Bluetooth Laser Travel Mouse (bluetooth, HID++ 1.0)
Logitech M720 Triathlon (bluetooth, HID++ 4.5)
Logitech M720 Triathlon (unifying, HID++ 4.5)
Logitech K400 Pro (unifying, HID++ 4.1)
Logitech K270 (eQUAD nano Lite, HID++ 2.0)
Logitech M185 (eQUAD nano Lite, HID++ 4.5)
Logitech LX501 keyboard (27 Mhz, HID++ builtin scroll-wheel, HID++ 1.0)
Logitech M-RAZ105 mouse (27 Mhz, HID++ extra mouse buttons, HID++ 1.0)

And by bentiss:
Logitech Touchpad T650 (unifying)
Logitech Touchpad T651 (bluetooth)
Logitech MX Master 3B (BLE)
Logitech G403 (plain USB / Gaming receiver)
