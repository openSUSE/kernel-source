Subject: [PATCH] x86-32: Fix kexec with stack canary
 (CONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR)
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.11
Git-commit: ac461122c88a10b7d775de2f56467f097c9e627a

commit ac461122c88a10b7d775de2f56467f097c9e627a upstream.

Commit e802a51ede91 ("x86/idt: Consolidate IDT invalidation") cleaned up
and unified the IDT invalidation that existed in a couple of places.  It
changed no actual real code.

Despite not changing any actual real code, it _did_ change code generation:
by implementing the common idt_invalidate() function in
archx86/kernel/idt.c, it made the use of the function in
arch/x86/kernel/machine_kexec_32.c be a real function call rather than an
(accidental) inlining of the function.

That, in turn, exposed two issues:

 - in load_segments(), we had incorrectly reset all the segment
   registers, which then made the stack canary load (which gcc does
   using offset of %gs) cause a trap.  Instead of %gs pointing to the
   stack canary, it will be the normal zero-based kernel segment, and
   the stack canary load will take a page fault at address 0x14.

 - to make this even harder to debug, we had invalidated the GDT just
   before calling idt_invalidate(), which meant that the fault happened
   with an invalid GDT, which in turn causes a triple fault and
   immediate reboot.

Fix this by

 (a) not reloading the special segments in load_segments(). We currently
     don't do any percpu accesses (which would require %fs on x86-32) in
     this area, but there's no reason to think that we might not want to
     do them, and like %gs, it's pointless to break it.

 (b) doing idt_invalidate() before invalidating the GDT, to keep things
     at least _slightly_ more debuggable for a bit longer. Without a
     IDT, traps will not work. Without a GDT, traps also will not work,
     but neither will any segment loads etc. So in a very real sense,
     the GDT is even more core than the IDT.
