Subject: [PATCH] media: v4l2-ctrl: Lock main_hdl on operations of
 requests_queued.
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.7
Git-commit: df4a3e7f88e3b0d7ae46d70b9ff8e3c0ea730785

[ Upstream commit df4a3e7f88e3b0d7ae46d70b9ff8e3c0ea730785 ]

There's a race condition between the list_del_init in the
v4l2_ctrl_request_complete, and the list_add_tail in the
v4l2_ctrl_request_queue, since they can be called in different thread
and the requests_queued list is not protected by a lock. This can lead
to that the v4l2_ctrl_handler is still in the requests_queued list while
the request_is_queued is already set to false, which would cause
use-after-free if the v4l2_ctrl_handler is later released.

Fix this by locking the ->lock of main_hdl (which is the owner of the
requests_queued list) when doing list operations on the
->requests_queued list.
