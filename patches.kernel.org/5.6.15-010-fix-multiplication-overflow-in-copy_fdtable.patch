Subject: [PATCH] fix multiplication overflow in copy_fdtable()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.15
Git-commit: 4e89b7210403fa4a8acafe7c602b6212b7af6c3b

[ Upstream commit 4e89b7210403fa4a8acafe7c602b6212b7af6c3b ]

cpy and set really should be size_t; we won't get an overflow on that,
since sysctl_nr_open can't be set above ~(size_t)0 / sizeof(void *),
so nr that would've managed to overflow size_t on that multiplication
won't get anywhere near copy_fdtable() - we'll fail with EMFILE
before that.

Cc: stable@kernel.org # v2.6.25+
Fixes: 9cfe015aa424 (get rid of NR_OPEN and introduce a sysctl_nr_open)
