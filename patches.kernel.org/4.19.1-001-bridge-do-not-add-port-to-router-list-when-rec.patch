Subject: [PATCH] bridge: do not add port to router list when receives query
 with source 0.0.0.0
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.1
Git-commit: 5a2de63fd1a59c30c02526d427bc014b98adf508

[ Upstream commit 5a2de63fd1a59c30c02526d427bc014b98adf508 ]

Based on RFC 4541, 2.1.1.  IGMP Forwarding Rules

  The switch supporting IGMP snooping must maintain a list of
  multicast routers and the ports on which they are attached.  This
  list can be constructed in any combination of the following ways:

  a) This list should be built by the snooping switch sending
     Multicast Router Solicitation messages as described in IGMP
     Multicast Router Discovery [MRDISC].  It may also snoop
     Multicast Router Advertisement messages sent by and to other
     nodes.

  b) The arrival port for IGMP Queries (sent by multicast routers)
     where the source address is not 0.0.0.0.

We should not add the port to router list when receives query with source
0.0.0.0.
