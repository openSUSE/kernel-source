Subject: [PATCH] scsi: cxlflash: Reset command ioasc
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.4
Git-commit: 96cf727fe8f102bf92150b741db71ee39fb8c521

commit 96cf727fe8f102bf92150b741db71ee39fb8c521 upstream.

In the event of a command failure, cxlflash returns the failure to the upper
layers to process. After processing the error, when the command is queued
again, the private command structure will not be zeroed and the ioasc could be
stale. Per the SISLite specification, the AFU only sets the ioasc in the
presence of a failure. Thus, even though the original command succeeds the
second time, the command is considered a failure due to stale ioasc. This
cycle repeats indefinitely and can cause a hang or IO failure.

To fix the issue, clear the ioasc before queuing any command.
