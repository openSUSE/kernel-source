Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx: change the spi-nor tx
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.12
Git-commit: b2a4f4a302b83976ad0d2930abe0f38e6119a144

[ Upstream commit b2a4f4a302b83976ad0d2930abe0f38e6119a144 ]

Before commit 0e30f47232ab5 ("mtd: spi-nor: add support for DTR protocol"),
for all PP command, it only support 1-1-1 mode, no matter the tx setting
in dts. But after the upper commit, the logic change. It will choose
the best mode(fastest mode) which flash device and spi-nor host controller
both support.

Though the spi-nor device on imx6sx-sdb/imx6ul(l/z)-14x14-evk board
do not support PP-1-4-4/PP-1-1-4, but if tx is 4 in dts file, it will also
impact the read mode selection. For the spi-nor device on the upper mentioned
boards, they support read 1-4-4 mode and read 1-1-4 mode according to the
device internal sfdp register. But qspi host controller do not support
read 1-4-4 mode. so need to set the tx to 1, let the common code finally
select read 1-1-4 mode, PP-1-1-1 mode.
