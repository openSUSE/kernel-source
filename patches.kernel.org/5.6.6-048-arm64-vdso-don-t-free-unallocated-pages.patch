Subject: [PATCH] arm64: vdso: don't free unallocated pages
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.6
Git-commit: 9cc3d0c6915aee5140f8335d41bbc3ff1b79aa4e

commit 9cc3d0c6915aee5140f8335d41bbc3ff1b79aa4e upstream.

The aarch32_vdso_pages[] array never has entries allocated in the C_VVAR
or C_VDSO slots, and as the array is zero initialized these contain
NULL.

However in __aarch32_alloc_vdso_pages() when
aarch32_alloc_kuser_vdso_page() fails we attempt to free the page whose
struct page is at NULL, which is obviously nonsensical.

This patch removes the erroneous page freeing.
