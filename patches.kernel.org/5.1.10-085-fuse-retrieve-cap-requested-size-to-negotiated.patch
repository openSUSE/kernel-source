Subject: [PATCH] fuse: retrieve: cap requested size to negotiated max_write
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.10
Git-commit: 7640682e67b33cab8628729afec8ca92b851394f

[ Upstream commit 7640682e67b33cab8628729afec8ca92b851394f ]

FUSE filesystem server and kernel client negotiate during initialization
phase, what should be the maximum write size the client will ever issue.
Correspondingly the filesystem server then queues sys_read calls to read
requests with buffer capacity large enough to carry request header + that
max_write bytes. A filesystem server is free to set its max_write in
anywhere in the range between [1*page, fc->max_pages*page]. In particular
go-fuse[2] sets max_write by default as 64K, wheres default fc->max_pages
corresponds to 128K. Libfuse also allows users to configure max_write, but
by default presets it to possible maximum.

If max_write is < fc->max_pages*page, and in NOTIFY_RETRIEVE handler we
allow to retrieve more than max_write bytes, corresponding prepared
NOTIFY_REPLY will be thrown away by fuse_dev_do_read, because the
filesystem server, in full correspondence with server/client contract, will
be only queuing sys_read with ~max_write buffer capacity, and
fuse_dev_do_read throws away requests that cannot fit into server request
buffer. In turn the filesystem server could get stuck waiting indefinitely
for NOTIFY_REPLY since NOTIFY_RETRIEVE handler returned OK which is
understood by clients as that NOTIFY_REPLY was queued and will be sent
back.

Cap requested size to negotiate max_write to avoid the problem.  This
aligns with the way NOTIFY_RETRIEVE handler works, which already
unconditionally caps requested retrieve size to fuse_conn->max_pages.  This
way it should not hurt NOTIFY_RETRIEVE semantic if we return less data than
was originally requested.

Please see [1] for context where the problem of stuck filesystem was hit
for real, how the situation was traced and for more involving patch that
did not make it into the tree.
