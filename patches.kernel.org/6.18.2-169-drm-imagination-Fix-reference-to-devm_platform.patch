Subject: [PATCH] drm/imagination: Fix reference to
 devm_platform_get_and_ioremap_resource()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.2
Git-commit: f1aa93005d0d6fb3293ca9c3eb08d1d1557117bf

[ Upstream commit f1aa93005d0d6fb3293ca9c3eb08d1d1557117bf ]

The call to devm_platform_ioremap_resource() was replaced by a call to
devm_platform_get_and_ioremap_resource(), but the comment referring to
the function's possible returned error codes was not updated.
