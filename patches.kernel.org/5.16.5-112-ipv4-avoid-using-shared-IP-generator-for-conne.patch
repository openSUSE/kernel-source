Subject: [PATCH] ipv4: avoid using shared IP generator for connected sockets
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.16.5
Git-commit: 23f57406b82de51809d5812afd96f210f8b627f3

commit 23f57406b82de51809d5812afd96f210f8b627f3 upstream.

ip_select_ident_segs() has been very conservative about using
the connected socket private generator only for packets with IP_DF
set, claiming it was needed for some VJ compression implementations.

As mentioned in this referenced document, this can be abused.
(Ref: Off-Path TCP Exploits of the Mixed IPID Assignment)

Before switching to pure random IPID generation and possibly hurt
some workloads, lets use the private inet socket generator.

Not only this will remove one vulnerability, this will also
improve performance of TCP flows using pmtudisc==IP_PMTUDISC_DONT

Fixes: 73f156a6e8c1 ("inetpeer: get rid of ip_id_count")
