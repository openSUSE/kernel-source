Subject: [PATCH] fs: don't scan the inode cache before SB_BORN is set
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.13
Git-commit: 79f546a696bff2590169fb5684e23d65f4d9f591

commit 79f546a696bff2590169fb5684e23d65f4d9f591 upstream.

We recently had an oops reported on a 4.14 kernel in
xfs_reclaim_inodes_count() where sb->s_fs_info pointed to garbage
and so the m_perag_tree lookup walked into lala land.  It produces
an oops down this path during the failed mount:

  radix_tree_gang_lookup_tag+0xc4/0x130
  xfs_perag_get_tag+0x37/0xf0
  xfs_reclaim_inodes_count+0x32/0x40
  xfs_fs_nr_cached_objects+0x11/0x20
  super_cache_count+0x35/0xc0
  shrink_slab.part.66+0xb1/0x370
  shrink_node+0x7e/0x1a0
  try_to_free_pages+0x199/0x470
  __alloc_pages_slowpath+0x3a1/0xd20
  __alloc_pages_nodemask+0x1c3/0x200
  cache_grow_begin+0x20b/0x2e0
  fallback_alloc+0x160/0x200
  kmem_cache_alloc+0x111/0x4e0

The problem is that the superblock shrinker is running before the
filesystem structures it depends on have been fully set up. i.e.
the shrinker is registered in sget(), before ->fill_super() has been
called, and the shrinker can call into the filesystem before
fill_super() does it's setup work. Essentially we are exposed to
both use-after-free and use-before-initialisation bugs here.

To fix this, add a check for the SB_BORN flag in super_cache_count.
In general, this flag is not set until ->fs_mount() completes
successfully, so we know that it is set after the filesystem
setup has completed. This matches the trylock_super() behaviour
which will not let super_cache_scan() run if SB_BORN is not set, and
hence will not allow the superblock shrinker from entering the
filesystem while it is being set up or after it has failed setup
and is being torn down.
