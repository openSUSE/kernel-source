Subject: [PATCH] perf vendor events powerpc: Update datasource event name to
 fix duplicate events
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.2
Git-commit: 9eef41014fe01287dae79fe208b9b433b13040bb

[ Upstream commit 9eef41014fe01287dae79fe208b9b433b13040bb ]

Running "perf list" on powerpc fails with segfault as below:

   $ ./perf list
   Segmentation fault (core dumped)
   $

This happens because of duplicate events in the JSON list.  The powerpc
JSON event list contains some event with same event name, but different
event code. They are:

- PM_INST_FROM_L3MISS (Present in datasource and frontend)
- PM_MRK_DATA_FROM_L2MISS (Present in datasource and marked)
- PM_MRK_INST_FROM_L3MISS (Present in datasource and marked)
- PM_MRK_DATA_FROM_L3MISS (Present in datasource and marked)

pmu_events_table__num_events() uses the value from table_pmu->num_entries
which includes duplicate events as well. This causes issue during "perf
list" and results in a segmentation fault.

Since both event codes are valid, append _DSRC to the Data Source events
(datasource.json), so that they would have a unique name.

Also add PM_DATA_FROM_L2MISS_DSRC and PM_DATA_FROM_L3MISS_DSRC events.

With the fix, 'perf list' works as expected.
