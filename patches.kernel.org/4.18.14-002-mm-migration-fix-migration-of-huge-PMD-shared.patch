Subject: [PATCH] mm: migration: fix migration of huge PMD shared pages
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.14
Git-commit: 017b1660df89f5fb4bfe66c34e35f7d2031100c7

commit 017b1660df89f5fb4bfe66c34e35f7d2031100c7 upstream.

The page migration code employs try_to_unmap() to try and unmap the source
page.  This is accomplished by using rmap_walk to find all vmas where the
page is mapped.  This search stops when page mapcount is zero.  For shared
PMD huge pages, the page map count is always 1 no matter the number of
mappings.  Shared mappings are tracked via the reference count of the PMD
page.  Therefore, try_to_unmap stops prematurely and does not completely
unmap all mappings of the source page.

This problem can result is data corruption as writes to the original
source page can happen after contents of the page are copied to the target
page.  Hence, data is lost.

This problem was originally seen as DB corruption of shared global areas
after a huge page was soft offlined due to ECC memory errors.  DB
developers noticed they could reproduce the issue by (hotplug) offlining
memory used to back huge pages.  A simple testcase can reproduce the
problem by creating a shared PMD mapping (note that this must be at least
PUD_SIZE in size and PUD_SIZE aligned (1GB on x86)), and using
migrate_pages() to migrate process pages between nodes while continually
writing to the huge pages being migrated.

To fix, have the try_to_unmap_one routine check for huge PMD sharing by
calling huge_pmd_unshare for hugetlbfs huge pages.  If it is a shared
mapping it will be 'unshared' which removes the page table entry and drops
the reference on the PMD page.  After this, flush caches and TLB.

mmu notifiers are called before locking page tables, but we can not be
sure of PMD sharing until page tables are locked.  Therefore, check for
the possibility of PMD sharing before locking so that notifiers can
prepare for the worst possible case.
