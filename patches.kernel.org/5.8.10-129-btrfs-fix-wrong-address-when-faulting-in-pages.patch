Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: fix wrong address when faulting in pages in the search
 ioctl
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.10
Git-commit: 1c78544eaa4660096aeb6a57ec82b42cdb3bfe5a

commit 1c78544eaa4660096aeb6a57ec82b42cdb3bfe5a upstream.

When faulting in the pages for the user supplied buffer for the search
ioctl, we are passing only the base address of the buffer to the function
fault_in_pages_writeable(). This means that after the first iteration of
the while loop that searches for leaves, when we have a non-zero offset,
stored in 'sk_offset', we try to fault in a wrong page range.

So fix this by adding the offset in 'sk_offset' to the base address of the
user supplied buffer when calling fault_in_pages_writeable().

Several users have reported that the applications compsize and bees have
started to operate incorrectly since commit a48b73eca4ceb9 ("btrfs: fix
potential deadlock in the search ioctl") was added to stable trees, and
these applications make heavy use of the search ioctls. This fixes their
issues.
