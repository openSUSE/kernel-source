Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm64: timer: Always evaluate the need for a soft timer
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.3
Git-commit: b450dcce93bc2cf6d2bfaf5a0de88a94ebad8f89

commit b450dcce93bc2cf6d2bfaf5a0de88a94ebad8f89 upstream.

When updating the interrupt state for an emulated timer, we return
early and skip the setup of a soft timer that runs in parallel
with the guest.

While this is OK if we have set the interrupt pending, it is pretty
wrong if the guest moved CVAL into the future.  In that case,
no timer is armed and the guest can wait for a very long time
(it will take a full put/load cycle for the situation to resolve).

This is specially visible with EDK2 running at EL2, but still
using the EL1 virtual timer, which in that case is fully emulated.
Any key-press takes ages to be captured, as there is no UART
interrupt and EDK2 relies on polling from a timer...

The fix is simply to drop the early return. If the timer interrupt
is pending, we will still return early, and otherwise arm the soft
timer.
