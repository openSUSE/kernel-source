Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: add barriers to btrfs_sync_log before log_commit_wait
 wakeups
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.12
Git-commit: 3d3a2e610ea5e7c6d4f9481ecce5d8e2d8317843

[ Upstream commit 3d3a2e610ea5e7c6d4f9481ecce5d8e2d8317843 ]

Currently the code assumes that there's an implied barrier by the
sequence of code preceding the wakeup, namely the mutex unlock.

As Nikolay pointed out:

I think this is wrong (not your code) but the original assumption that
the RELEASE semantics provided by mutex_unlock is sufficient.
According to memory-barriers.txt:

Section 'LOCK ACQUISITION FUNCTIONS' states:

 (2) RELEASE operation implication:

     Memory operations issued before the RELEASE will be completed before the
     RELEASE operation has completed.

     Memory operations issued after the RELEASE *may* be completed before the
     RELEASE operation has completed.

(I've bolded the may portion)

The example given there:

As an example, consider the following:

    *A = a;
    *B = b;
    ACQUIRE
    *C = c;
    *D = d;
    RELEASE
    *E = e;
    *F = f;

The following sequence of events is acceptable:

    ACQUIRE, {*F,*A}, *E, {*C,*D}, *B, RELEASE

So if we assume that *C is modifying the flag which the waitqueue is checking,
and *E is the actual wakeup, then those accesses can be re-ordered...

IMHO this code should be considered broken...
