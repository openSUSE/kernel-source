Subject: [PATCH] ARM: hwmod: RTC: Don't assume lock/unlock will be called with
 irq enabled
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.12
Git-commit: 6d609b35c815ba20132b7b64bcca04516bb17c56

[ Upstream commit 6d609b35c815ba20132b7b64bcca04516bb17c56 ]

When the RTC lock and unlock functions were introduced it was likely
assumed that they would always be called from irq enabled context, hence
the use of local_irq_disable/enable. This is no longer true as the
RTC+DDR path makes a late call during the suspend path after irqs
have been disabled to enable the RTC hwmod which calls both unlock and
lock, leading to IRQs being reenabled through the local_irq_enable call
in omap_hwmod_rtc_lock call.

To avoid this change the local_irq_disable/enable to
local_irq_save/restore to ensure that from whatever context this is
called the proper IRQ configuration is maintained.
