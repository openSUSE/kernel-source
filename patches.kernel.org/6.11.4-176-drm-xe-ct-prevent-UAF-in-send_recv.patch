Subject: [PATCH] drm/xe/ct: prevent UAF in send_recv()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.4
Git-commit: db7f92af626178ba59dbbcdd5dee9ec24a987a88

commit db7f92af626178ba59dbbcdd5dee9ec24a987a88 upstream.

Ensure we serialize with completion side to prevent UAF with fence going
out of scope on the stack, since we have no clue if it will fire after
the timeout before we can erase from the xa. Also we have some dependent
loads and stores for which we need the correct ordering, and we lack the
needed barriers. Fix this by grabbing the ct->lock after the wait, which
is also held by the completion side.

v2 (Badal):
 - Also print done after acquiring the lock and seeing timeout.
