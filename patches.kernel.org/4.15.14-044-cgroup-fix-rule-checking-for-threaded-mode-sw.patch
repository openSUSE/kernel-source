Subject: [PATCH] cgroup: fix rule checking for threaded mode switching
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.14
Git-commit: d1897c9538edafd4ae6bbd03cc075962ddde2c21

commit d1897c9538edafd4ae6bbd03cc075962ddde2c21 upstream.

A domain cgroup isn't allowed to be turned threaded if its subtree is
populated or domain controllers are enabled.  cgroup_enable_threaded()
depended on cgroup_can_be_thread_root() test to enforce this rule.  A
parent which has populated domain descendants or have domain
controllers enabled can't become a thread root, so the above rules are
enforced automatically.

However, for the root cgroup which can host mixed domain and threaded
children, cgroup_can_be_thread_root() doesn't check any of those
conditions and thus first level cgroups ends up escaping those rules.

This patch fixes the bug by adding explicit checks for those rules in
cgroup_enable_threaded().
