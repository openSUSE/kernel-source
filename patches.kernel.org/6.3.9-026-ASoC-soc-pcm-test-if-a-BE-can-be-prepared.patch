Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: soc-pcm: test if a BE can be prepared
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.3.9
Git-commit: e123036be377ddf628226a7c6d4f9af5efd113d3

[ Upstream commit e123036be377ddf628226a7c6d4f9af5efd113d3 ]

In the BE hw_params configuration, the existing code checks if any of the
existing FEs are prepared, running, paused or suspended - and skips the
configuration in those cases. This allows multiple calls of hw_params
which the ALSA state machine supports.

This check is not handled for the prepare stage, which can lead to the
same BE being prepared multiple times. This patch adds a check similar to
that of the hw_params, with the main difference being that the suspended
state is allowed: the ALSA state machine allows a transition from
suspended to prepared with hw_params skipped.

This problem was detected on Intel IPC4/SoundWire devices, where the BE
dailink .prepare stage is used to configure the SoundWire stream with a
bank switch. Multiple .prepare calls lead to conflicts with the .trigger
operation with IPC4 configurations. This problem was not detected earlier
on Intel devices, HDaudio BE dailinks detect that the link is already
prepared and skip the configuration, and for IPC3 devices there is no BE
trigger.
