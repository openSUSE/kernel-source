Subject: [PATCH] hwspinlock: Introduce hwspin_lock_bust()
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.50
Git-commit: 7c327d56597d8de1680cf24e956b704270d3d84a

[ Upstream commit 7c327d56597d8de1680cf24e956b704270d3d84a ]

When a remoteproc crashes or goes down unexpectedly this can result in
a state where locks held by the remoteproc will remain locked possibly
resulting in deadlock. This new API hwspin_lock_bust() allows
hwspinlock implementers to define a bust operation for freeing previously
acquired hwspinlocks after verifying ownership of the acquired lock.
