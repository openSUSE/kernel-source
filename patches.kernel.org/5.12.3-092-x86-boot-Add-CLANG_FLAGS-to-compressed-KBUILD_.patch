Subject: [PATCH] x86/boot: Add $(CLANG_FLAGS) to compressed KBUILD_CFLAGS
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.3
Git-commit: d5cbd80e302dfea59726c44c56ab7957f822409f

[ Upstream commit d5cbd80e302dfea59726c44c56ab7957f822409f ]

When cross compiling x86 on an ARM machine with clang, there are several
errors along the lines of:

  arch/x86/include/asm/string_64.h:27:10: error: invalid output constraint '=&c' in asm

This happens because the compressed boot Makefile reassigns KBUILD_CFLAGS
and drops the clang flags that set the target architecture ('--target=')
and the path to the GNU cross tools ('--prefix='), meaning that the host
architecture is targeted.

These flags are available as $(CLANG_FLAGS) from the main Makefile so
add them to the compressed boot folder's KBUILD_CFLAGS so that cross
compiling works as expected.
