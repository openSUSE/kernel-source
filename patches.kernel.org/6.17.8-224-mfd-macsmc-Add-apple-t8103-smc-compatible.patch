Subject: [PATCH] mfd: macsmc: Add "apple,t8103-smc" compatible
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.8
Git-commit: 9b959e525fa7e8518e57554b6e17849942938dfc

[ Upstream commit 9b959e525fa7e8518e57554b6e17849942938dfc ]

After discussion with the devicetree maintainers we agreed to not extend
lists with the generic compatible "apple,smc" anymore [1]. Use
"apple,t8103-smc" as base compatible as it is the SoC the driver and
bindings were written for.
