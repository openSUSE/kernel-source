Subject: [PATCH] kernel/acct.c: fix the acct->needcheck check in
 check_free_space()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.13
Git-commit: 4d9570158b6260f449e317a5f9ed030c2504a615

commit 4d9570158b6260f449e317a5f9ed030c2504a615 upstream.

As Tsukada explains, the time_is_before_jiffies(acct->needcheck) check
is very wrong, we need time_is_after_jiffies() to make sys_acct() work.

Ignoring the overflows, the code should "goto out" if needcheck >
jiffies, while currently it checks "needcheck < jiffies" and thus in the
likely case check_free_space() does nothing until jiffies overflow.

In particular this means that sys_acct() is simply broken, acct_on()
sets acct->needcheck = jiffies and expects that check_free_space()
should set acct->active = 1 after the free-space check, but this won't
happen if jiffies increments in between.

This was broken by commit 32dc73086015 ("get rid of timer in
kern/acct.c") in 2011, then another (correct) commit 795a2f22a8ea
("acct() should honour the limits from the very beginning") made the
problem more visible.
