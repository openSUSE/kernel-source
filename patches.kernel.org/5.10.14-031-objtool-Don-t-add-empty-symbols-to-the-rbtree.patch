Subject: [PATCH] objtool: Don't add empty symbols to the rbtree
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.14
Git-commit: a2e38dffcd93541914aba52b30c6a52acca35201

[ Upstream commit a2e38dffcd93541914aba52b30c6a52acca35201 ]

Building with the Clang assembler shows the following warning:

  arch/x86/kernel/ftrace_64.o: warning: objtool: missing symbol for insn at offset 0x16

The Clang assembler strips section symbols.  That ends up giving
objtool's find_func_containing() much more test coverage than normal.
Turns out, find_func_containing() doesn't work so well for overlapping
symbols:

     2: 000000000000000e     0 NOTYPE  LOCAL  DEFAULT    2 fgraph_trace
     3: 000000000000000f     0 NOTYPE  LOCAL  DEFAULT    2 trace
     4: 0000000000000000   165 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT    2 __fentry__
     5: 000000000000000e     0 NOTYPE  GLOBAL DEFAULT    2 ftrace_stub

The zero-length NOTYPE symbols are inside __fentry__(), confusing the
rbtree search for any __fentry__() offset coming after a NOTYPE.

Try to avoid this problem by not adding zero-length symbols to the
rbtree.  They're rare and aren't needed in the rbtree anyway.

One caveat, this actually might not end up being the right fix.
Non-empty overlapping symbols, if they exist, could have the same
problem.  But that would need bigger changes, let's see if we can get
away with the easy fix for now.
