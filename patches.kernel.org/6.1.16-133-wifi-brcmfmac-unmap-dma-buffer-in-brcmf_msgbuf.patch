Subject: [PATCH] wifi: brcmfmac: unmap dma buffer in
 brcmf_msgbuf_alloc_pktid()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: b9f420032f2ba1e634b22ca7b433e5c40ea663af

[ Upstream commit b9f420032f2ba1e634b22ca7b433e5c40ea663af ]

After the DMA buffer is mapped to a physical address, address is stored
in pktids in brcmf_msgbuf_alloc_pktid(). Then, pktids is parsed in
brcmf_msgbuf_get_pktid()/brcmf_msgbuf_release_array() to obtain physaddr
and later unmap the DMA buffer. But when count is always equal to
pktids->array_size, physaddr isn't stored in pktids and the DMA buffer
will not be unmapped anyway.
