Subject: [PATCH] selftests/bpf: Fix the flaky tc_redirect_dtime test
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.2
Git-commit: 177f1d083a19af58f4b1206d299ed73689249fd8

[ Upstream commit 177f1d083a19af58f4b1206d299ed73689249fd8 ]

BPF CI has been reporting the tc_redirect_dtime test failing
from time to time:

test_inet_dtime:PASS:setns src 0 nsec
(network_helpers.c:253: errno: No route to host) Failed to connect to server
close_netns:PASS:setns 0 nsec
test_inet_dtime:FAIL:connect_to_fd unexpected connect_to_fd: actual -1 < expected 0
test_tcp_clear_dtime:PASS:tcp ip6 clear dtime ingress_fwdns_p100 0 nsec

The connect_to_fd failure (EHOSTUNREACH) is from the
test_tcp_clear_dtime() test and it is the very first IPv6 traffic
after setting up all the links, addresses, and routes.

The symptom is this first connect() is always slow. In my setup, it
could take ~3s.

After some tracing and tcpdump, the slowness is mostly spent in
the neighbor solicitation in the "ns_fwd" namespace while
the "ns_src" and "ns_dst" are fine.

I forced the kernel to drop the neighbor solicitation messages.
I can then reproduce EHOSTUNREACH. What actually happen could be:
- the neighbor advertisement came back a little slow.
- the "ns_fwd" namespace concluded a neighbor discovery failure
  and triggered the ndisc_error_report() => ip6_link_failure() =>
  icmpv6_send(skb, ICMPV6_DEST_UNREACH, ICMPV6_ADDR_UNREACH, 0)
- the client's connect() reports EHOSTUNREACH after receiving
  the ICMPV6_DEST_UNREACH message.

The neigh table of both "ns_src" and "ns_dst" namespace has already
been manually populated but not the "ns_fwd" namespace. This patch
fixes it by manually populating the neigh table also in the "ns_fwd"
namespace.

Although the namespace configuration part had been existed before
the tc_redirect_dtime test, still Fixes-tagging the patch when
the tc_redirect_dtime test was added since it is the only test
hitting it so far.
