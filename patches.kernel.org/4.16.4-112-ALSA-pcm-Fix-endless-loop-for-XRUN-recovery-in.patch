Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: pcm: Fix endless loop for XRUN recovery in OSS
 emulation
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.4
Git-commit: e15dc99dbb9cf99f6432e8e3c0b3a8f7a3403a86

commit e15dc99dbb9cf99f6432e8e3c0b3a8f7a3403a86 upstream.

The commit 02a5d6925cd3 ("ALSA: pcm: Avoid potential races between OSS
ioctls and read/write") split the PCM preparation code to a locked
version, and it added a sanity check of runtime->oss.prepare flag
along with the change.  This leaded to an endless loop when the stream
gets XRUN: namely, snd_pcm_oss_write3() and co call
snd_pcm_oss_prepare() without setting runtime->oss.prepare flag and
the loop continues until the PCM state reaches to another one.

As the function is supposed to execute the preparation
unconditionally, drop the invalid state check there.

The bug was triggered by syzkaller.
