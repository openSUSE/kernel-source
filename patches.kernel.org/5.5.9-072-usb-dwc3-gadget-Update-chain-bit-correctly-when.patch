Subject: [PATCH] usb: dwc3: gadget: Update chain bit correctly when using sg
 list
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.9
Git-commit: dad2aff3e827b112f27fa5e6f2bf87a110067c3f

commit dad2aff3e827b112f27fa5e6f2bf87a110067c3f upstream.

If scatter-gather operation is allowed, a large USB request is split
into multiple TRBs. For preparing TRBs for sg list, driver iterates
over the list and creates TRB for each sg and mark the chain bit to
false for the last sg. The current IOMMU driver is clubbing the list
of sgs which shares a page boundary into one and giving it to USB driver.
With this the number of sgs mapped it not equal to the the number of sgs
passed. Because of this USB driver is not marking the chain bit to false
since it couldn't iterate to the last sg. This patch addresses this issue
by marking the chain bit to false if it is the last mapped sg.

At a practical level, this patch resolves USB transfer stalls
seen with adb on dwc3 based db845c, pixel3 and other qcom
hardware after functionfs gadget added scatter-gather support
around v4.20.
