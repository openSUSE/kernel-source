Subject: [PATCH] wifi: ath10k: poll service ready message before failing
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.33
Git-commit: e57b7d62a1b2f496caf0beba81cec3c90fad80d5

[ Upstream commit e57b7d62a1b2f496caf0beba81cec3c90fad80d5 ]

Currently host relies on CE interrupts to get notified that
the service ready message is ready. This results in timeout
issue if the interrupt is not fired, due to some unknown
reasons. See below logs:

[76321.937866] ath10k_pci 0000:02:00.0: wmi service ready event not received
...
[76322.016738] ath10k_pci 0000:02:00.0: Could not init core: -110

And finally it causes WLAN interface bring up failure.

Change to give it one more chance here by polling CE rings,
before failing directly.

Tested-on: QCA6174 hw3.2 PCI WLAN.RM.4.4.1-00157-QCARMSWPZ-1
