Subject: [PATCH] USB: Accept bulk endpoints with 1024-byte maxpacket
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.8
Git-commit: fb5ee84ea72c5f1b6cabdd1c9d6e8648995ca7c6

commit fb5ee84ea72c5f1b6cabdd1c9d6e8648995ca7c6 upstream.

Some non-compliant high-speed USB devices have bulk endpoints with a
1024-byte maxpacket size.  Although such endpoints don't work with
xHCI host controllers, they do work with EHCI controllers.  We used to
accept these invalid sizes (with a warning), but we no longer do
because of an unintentional change introduced by commit aed9d65ac327
("USB: validate wMaxPacketValue entries in endpoint descriptors").

This patch restores the old behavior, so that people with these
peculiar devices can use them without patching their kernels by hand.
