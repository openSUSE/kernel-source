Subject: [PATCH] livepatch: Match old_sympos 0 and 1 in klp_find_func()
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.64
Git-commit: 139560e8b973402140cafeb68c656c1374bd4c20

[ Upstream commit 139560e8b973402140cafeb68c656c1374bd4c20 ]

When there is only one function of the same name, old_sympos of 0 and 1
are logically identical. Match them in klp_find_func().

This is to avoid a corner case with different toolchain behavior.

In this specific issue, two versions of kpatch-build were used to
build livepatch for the same kernel. One assigns old_sympos == 0 for
unique local functions, the other assigns old_sympos == 1 for unique
local functions. Both versions work fine by themselves. (PS: This
behavior change was introduced in a downstream version of kpatch-build.
This change does not exist in upstream kpatch-build.)

However, during livepatch upgrade (with the replace flag set) from a
patch built with one version of kpatch-build to the same fix built with
the other version of kpatch-build, livepatching fails with errors like:

This happens because klp_find_func() thinks somefunc with old_sympos==0
is not the same as somefunc with old_sympos==1, and klp_add_object_nops
adds another xxx/func,1 to the list of functions to patch.
