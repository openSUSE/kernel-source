Subject: [PATCH] parisc: Hide Diva-built-in serial aux and graphics card
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.10
Git-commit: bcf3f1752a622f1372d3252d0fea8855d89812e7

commit bcf3f1752a622f1372d3252d0fea8855d89812e7 upstream.

Diva GSP card has built-in serial AUX port and ATI graphic card which simply
don't work and which both don't have external connectors.  User Guides even
mention that those devices shouldn't be used.
So, prevent that Linux drivers try to enable those devices.
