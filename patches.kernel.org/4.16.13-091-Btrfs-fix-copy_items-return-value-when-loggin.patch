Subject: [PATCH] Btrfs: fix copy_items() return value when logging an inode
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.13
Git-commit: 8434ec46c6e3232cebc25a910363b29f5c617820

[ Upstream commit 8434ec46c6e3232cebc25a910363b29f5c617820 ]

When logging an inode, at tree-log.c:copy_items(), if we call
btrfs_next_leaf() at the loop which checks for the need to log holes, we
need to make sure copy_items() returns the value 1 to its caller and
not 0 (on success). This is because the path the caller passed was
released and is now different from what is was before, and the caller
expects a return value of 0 to mean both success and that the path
has not changed, while a return value of 1 means both success and
signals the caller that it can not reuse the path, it has to perform
another tree search.

Even though this is a case that should not be triggered on normal
circumstances or very rare at least, its consequences can be very
unpredictable (especially when replaying a log tree).
