Subject: [PATCH] clk: qcom: gcc-sc7180: Use floor ops for sdcc clks
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.4
Git-commit: 6d37a8d192830267e6b10a6d57ae28d2e89097e7

[ Upstream commit 6d37a8d192830267e6b10a6d57ae28d2e89097e7 ]

I would repeat the same commit message that was in commit 5e4b7e82d497
("clk: qcom: gcc-sdm845: Use floor ops for sdcc clks") but it seems
silly to do so when you could just go read that commit.

NOTE: this is actually extra terrible because we're missing the 50 MHz
rate in the table (see the next patch AKA ("clk: qcom: gcc-sc7180: Add
50 MHz clock rate for SDC2")).  That means then when you run an older
SD card it'll try to clock it at 100 MHz when it's only specced to run
at 50 MHz max.  As you can probably guess that doesn't work super
well.
