Subject: [PATCH] media: cec: check 'transmit_in_progress', not 'transmitting'
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.9
Git-commit: ac479b51f3f4aaa852b5d3f00ecfb9290230cf64

commit ac479b51f3f4aaa852b5d3f00ecfb9290230cf64 upstream.

Currently wait_event_interruptible_timeout is called in cec_thread_func()
when adap->transmitting is set. But if the adapter is unconfigured
while transmitting, then adap->transmitting is set to NULL. But the
hardware is still actually transmitting the message, and that's
indicated by adap->transmit_in_progress and we should wait until that
is finished or times out before transmitting new messages.

As the original commit says: adap->transmitting is the userspace view,
adap->transmit_in_progress reflects the hardware state.

However, if adap->transmitting is NULL and adap->transmit_in_progress
is true, then wait_event_interruptible is called (no timeout), which
can get stuck indefinitely if the CEC driver is flaky and never marks
the transmit-in-progress as 'done'.

So test against transmit_in_progress when deciding whether to use
the timeout variant or not, instead of testing against adap->transmitting.
