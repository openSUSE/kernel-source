Subject: [PATCH] mmc: bcm2835: Recover from MMC_SEND_EXT_CSD
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.8
Git-commit: 07d405769afea5718529fc9e341f0b13b3189b6f

[ Upstream commit 07d405769afea5718529fc9e341f0b13b3189b6f ]

If the user issues an "mmc extcsd read", the SD controller receives
what it thinks is a SEND_IF_COND command with an unexpected data block.
The resulting operations leave the FSM stuck in READWAIT, a state which
persists until the MMC framework resets the controller, by which point
the root filesystem is likely to have been unmounted.

A less heavyweight solution is to detect the condition and nudge the
FSM by asserting the (self-clearing) FORCE_DATA_MODE bit.
