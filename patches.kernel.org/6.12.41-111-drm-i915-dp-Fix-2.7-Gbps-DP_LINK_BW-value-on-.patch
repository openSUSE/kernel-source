Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915/dp: Fix 2.7 Gbps DP_LINK_BW value on g4x

commit 9e0c433d0c05fde284025264b89eaa4ad59f0a3e upstream.

On g4x we currently use the 96MHz non-SSC refclk, which can't actually
generate an exact 2.7 Gbps link rate. In practice we end up with 2.688
Gbps which seems to be close enough to actually work, but link training
is currently failing due to miscalculating the DP_LINK_BW value (we
calcualte it directly from port_clock which reflects the actual PLL
outpout frequency).

Ideas how to fix this:
- nudge port_clock back up to 270000 during PLL computation/readout
- track port_clock and the nominal link rate separately so they might
  differ a bit
- switch to the 100MHz refclk, but that one should be SSC so perhaps
  not something we want

While we ponder about a better solution apply some band aid to the
immediate issue of miscalculated DP_LINK_BW value. With this
I can again use 2.7 Gbps link rate on g4x.
