Subject: [PATCH] regulator: core: fix error path for
 regulator_set_voltage_unlocked
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.5
Git-commit: 70b464918e5331e488058870fcc6821d54c4e541

commit 70b464918e5331e488058870fcc6821d54c4e541 upstream.

During several error paths in the function
regulator_set_voltage_unlocked() the value of 'ret' can take on negative
error values. However, in calls that go through the 'goto out' statement,
this return value is lost and return 0 is used instead, indicating a
'pass'.

There are several cases where this function should legitimately return a
fail instead of a pass: one such case includes constraints check during
voltage selection in the call to regulator_check_voltage(), which can
have -EINVAL for the case when an unsupported voltage is incorrectly
requested. In that case, -22 is expected as the return value, not 0.
