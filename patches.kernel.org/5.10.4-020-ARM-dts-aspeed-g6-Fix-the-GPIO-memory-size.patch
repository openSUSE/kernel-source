Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: aspeed-g6: Fix the GPIO memory size
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.4
Git-commit: 886f82ce9f1f4559c139fdb2d79d158999ca38cd

[ Upstream commit 886f82ce9f1f4559c139fdb2d79d158999ca38cd ]

The GPIO controller is a GPIO controller followed by some SGPIO
controllers, which are a different type of device with their own binding
and drivers.

Make the gpio node cover the only conventional GPIO controller.
