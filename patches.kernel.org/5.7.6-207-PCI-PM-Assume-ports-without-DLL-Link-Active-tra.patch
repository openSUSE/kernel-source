Subject: [PATCH] PCI/PM: Assume ports without DLL Link Active train links in
 100 ms
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.6
Git-commit: ec411e02b7a2e785a4ed9ed283207cd14f48699d

[ Upstream commit ec411e02b7a2e785a4ed9ed283207cd14f48699d ]

Kai-Heng Feng reported that it takes a long time (> 1 s) to resume
Thunderbolt-connected devices from both runtime suspend and system sleep
(s2idle).

This was because some Downstream Ports that support > 5 GT/s do not also
support Data Link Layer Link Active reporting.  Per PCIe r5.0 sec 6.6.1:

  With a Downstream Port that supports Link speeds greater than 5.0 GT/s,
  software must wait a minimum of 100 ms after Link training completes
  before sending a Configuration Request to the device immediately below
  that Port. Software can determine when Link training completes by polling
  the Data Link Layer Link Active bit or by setting up an associated
  interrupt (see Section 6.7.3.3).

Sec 7.5.3.6 requires such Ports to support DLL Link Active reporting, but
at least the Intel JHL6240 Thunderbolt 3 Bridge [8086:15c0] and the Intel
JHL7540 Thunderbolt 3 Bridge [8086:15ea] do not.

Previously we tried to wait for Link training to complete, but since there
was no DLL Link Active reporting, all we could do was wait the worst-case
1000 ms, then another 100 ms.

Instead of using the supported speeds to determine whether to wait for Link
training, check whether the port supports DLL Link Active reporting.  The
Ports in question do not, so we'll wait only the 100 ms required for Ports
that support Link speeds <= 5 GT/s.

This of course assumes these Ports always train the Link within 100 ms even
if they are operating at > 5 GT/s, which is not required by the spec.
