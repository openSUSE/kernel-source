Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/papr_scm: Use the correct bind address
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.9
Git-commit: 5a3840a470c41ec0b85cd36ca80370330656b163

commit 5a3840a470c41ec0b85cd36ca80370330656b163 upstream.

When binding an SCM volume to a physical address the hypervisor has the
option to return early with a continue token with the expectation that
the guest will resume the bind operation until it completes. A quirk of
this interface is that the bind address will only be returned by the
first bind h-call and the subsequent calls will return
0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF for the bind address.

We currently do not save the address returned by the first h-call. As a
result we will use the junk address as the base of the bound region if
the hypervisor decides to split the bind across multiple h-calls. This
bug was found when testing with very large SCM volumes where the bind
process would take more time than they hypervisor's internal h-call time
limit would allow. This patch fixes the issue by saving the bind address
from the first call.
