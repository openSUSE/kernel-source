Subject: [PATCH] ext4: fix memory leak in ext4_fill_super
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.10
Git-commit: afd09b617db3786b6ef3dc43e28fe728cfea84df

commit afd09b617db3786b6ef3dc43e28fe728cfea84df upstream.

Buffer head references must be released before calling kill_bdev();
otherwise the buffer head (and its page referenced by b_data) will not
be freed by kill_bdev, and subsequently that bh will be leaked.

If blocksizes differ, sb_set_blocksize() will kill current buffers and
page cache by using kill_bdev(). And then super block will be reread
again but using correct blocksize this time. sb_set_blocksize() didn't
fully free superblock page and buffer head, and being busy, they were
not freed and instead leaked.

This can easily be reproduced by calling an infinite loop of:

  systemctl start <ext4_on_lvm>.mount, and
  systemctl stop <ext4_on_lvm>.mount

... since systemd creates a cgroup for each slice which it mounts, and
the bh leak get amplified by a dying memory cgroup that also never
gets freed, and memory consumption is much more easily noticed.

Fixes: ce40733ce93d ("ext4: Check for return value from sb_set_blocksize")
Fixes: ac27a0ec112a ("ext4: initial copy of files from ext3")
