Subject: [PATCH] USB: cdc-acm: fix unprivileged TIOCCSERIAL
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.4
Git-commit: dd5619582d60007139f0447382d2839f4f9e339b

[ Upstream commit dd5619582d60007139f0447382d2839f4f9e339b ]

TIOCSSERIAL is a horrid, underspecified, legacy interface which for most
serial devices is only useful for setting the close_delay and
closing_wait parameters.

A non-privileged user has only ever been able to set the since long
deprecated ASYNC_SPD flags and trying to change any other *supported*
feature should result in -EPERM being returned. Setting the current
values for any supported features should return success.

Fix the cdc-acm implementation which instead indicated that the
TIOCSSERIAL ioctl was not even implemented when a non-privileged user
set the current values.

Fixes: ba2d8ce9db0a ("cdc-acm: implement TIOCSSERIAL to avoid blocking close(2)")
