Subject: [PATCH] wifi: cfg80211: add an hrtimer based delayed work item
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.59
Git-commit: 7ceba45a6658ce637da334cd0ebf27f4ede6c0fe

[ Upstream commit 7ceba45a6658ce637da334cd0ebf27f4ede6c0fe ]

The normal timer mechanism assume that timeout further in the future
need a lower accuracy. As an example, the granularity for a timer
scheduled 4096 ms in the future on a 1000 Hz system is already 512 ms.
This granularity is perfectly sufficient for e.g. timeouts, but there
are other types of events that will happen at a future point in time and
require a higher accuracy.

Add a new wiphy_hrtimer_work type that uses an hrtimer internally. The
API is almost identical to the existing wiphy_delayed_work and it can be
used as a drop-in replacement after minor adjustments. The work will be
scheduled relative to the current time with a slack of 1 millisecond.
