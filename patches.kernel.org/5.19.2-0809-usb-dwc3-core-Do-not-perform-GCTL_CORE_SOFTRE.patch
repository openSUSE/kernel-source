Subject: [PATCH] usb: dwc3: core: Do not perform GCTL_CORE_SOFTRESET during
 bootup
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.2
Git-commit: 07903626d98853e605fe63e5ce149f1b7314bbea

[ Upstream commit 07903626d98853e605fe63e5ce149f1b7314bbea ]

According to the programming guide, it is recommended to
perform a GCTL_CORE_SOFTRESET only when switching the mode
from device to host or host to device. However, it is found
that during bootup when __dwc3_set_mode() is called for the
first time, GCTL_CORESOFTRESET is done with suspendable bit(BIT 17)
of DWC3_GUSB3PIPECTL set. This some times leads to issues
like controller going into bad state and controller registers
reading value zero. Until GCTL_CORESOFTRESET is done and
run/stop bit is set core initialization is not complete.
Setting suspendable bit of DWC3_GUSB3PIPECTL and then
performing GCTL_CORESOFTRESET is therefore not recommended.
Avoid this by only performing the reset if current_dr_role is set,
that is, when doing subsequent role switching.
