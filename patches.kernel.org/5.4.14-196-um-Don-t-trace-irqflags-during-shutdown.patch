Subject: [PATCH] um: Don't trace irqflags during shutdown
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.14
Git-commit: 5c1f33e2a03c0b8710b5d910a46f1e1fb0607679

commit 5c1f33e2a03c0b8710b5d910a46f1e1fb0607679 upstream.

In the main() code, we eventually enable signals just before
exec() or exit(), in order to to not have signals pending and
delivered *after* the exec().

I've observed SIGSEGV loops at this point, and the reason seems
to be the irqflags tracing; this makes sense as the kernel is
no longer really functional at this point. Since there's really
no reason to use unblock_signals_trace() here (I had just done
a global search & replace), use the plain unblock_signals() in
this case to avoid going into the no longer functional kernel.
