Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: pcm: Fix tight loop of OSS capture stream
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.7
Git-commit: e190161f96b88ffae870405fd6c3fdd1d2e7f98d

commit e190161f96b88ffae870405fd6c3fdd1d2e7f98d upstream.

When the trigger=off is passed for a PCM OSS stream, it sets the
start_threshold of the given substream to the boundary size, so that
it won't be automatically started.  This can be problematic for a
capture stream, unfortunately, as detected by syzkaller.  The scenario
is like the following:

- In __snd_pcm_lib_xfer() that is invoked from snd_pcm_oss_read()
  loop, we have a check whether the stream was already started or the
  stream can be auto-started.
- The function at this check returns 0 with trigger=off since we
  explicitly disable the auto-start.
- The loop continues and repeats calling __snd_pcm_lib_xfer() tightly,
  which may lead to an RCU stall.

This patch fixes the bug by simply allowing the wait for non-started
stream in the case of OSS capture.  For native usages, it's supposed
to be done by the caller side (which is user-space), hence it returns
zero like before.

(In theory, __snd_pcm_lib_xfer() could wait even for the native API
 usage cases, too; but I'd like to stay in a safer side for not
 breaking the existing stuff for now.)
