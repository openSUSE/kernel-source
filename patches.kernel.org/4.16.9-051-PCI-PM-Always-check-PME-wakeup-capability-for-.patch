Subject: [PATCH] PCI / PM: Always check PME wakeup capability for runtime
 wakeup support
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.9
Git-commit: 8feaec33b9868582654cd3d5355225dcb79aeca6

commit 8feaec33b9868582654cd3d5355225dcb79aeca6 upstream.

USB controller ASM1042 stops working after commit de3ef1eb1cd0 (PM /
core: Drop run_wake flag from struct dev_pm_info).

The device in question is not power managed by platform firmware,
furthermore, it only supports PME# from D3cold:
Capabilities: [78] Power Management version 3
       Flags: PMEClk- DSI- D1- D2- AuxCurrent=55mA PME(D0-,D1-,D2-,D3hot-,D3cold+)
       Status: D0 NoSoftRst+ PME-Enable- DSel=0 DScale=0 PME-

Before commit de3ef1eb1cd0, the device never gets runtime suspended.
After that commit, the device gets runtime suspended to D3hot, which can
not generate any PME#.

usb_hcd_pci_probe() unconditionally calls device_wakeup_enable(), hence
device_can_wakeup() in pci_dev_run_wake() always returns true.

So pci_dev_run_wake() needs to check PME wakeup capability as its first
condition.

In addition, change wakeup flag passed to pci_target_state() from false
to true, because we want to find the deepest state different from D3cold
that the device can still generate PME#. In this case, it's D0 for the
device in question.
