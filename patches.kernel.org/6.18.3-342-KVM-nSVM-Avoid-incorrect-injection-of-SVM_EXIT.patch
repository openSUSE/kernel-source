Subject: [PATCH] KVM: nSVM: Avoid incorrect injection of
 SVM_EXIT_CR0_SEL_WRITE

commit 3d80f4c93d3d26d0f9a0dd2844961a632eeea634 upstream.

When emulating L2 instructions, svm_check_intercept() checks whether a
write to CR0 should trigger a synthesized #VMEXIT with
SVM_EXIT_CR0_SEL_WRITE. However, it does not check whether L1 enabled
the intercept for SVM_EXIT_WRITE_CR0, which has higher priority
according to the APM (24593—Rev.  3.42—March 2024, Table 15-7):

  When both selective and non-selective CR0-write intercepts are active at
  the same time, the non-selective intercept takes priority. With respect
  to exceptions, the priority of this intercept is the same as the generic
  CR0-write intercept.

Make sure L1 does NOT intercept SVM_EXIT_WRITE_CR0 before checking if
SVM_EXIT_CR0_SEL_WRITE needs to be injected.

Opportunistically tweak the "not CR0" logic to explicitly bail early so
that it's more obvious that only CR0 has a selective intercept, and that
modifying icpt_info.exit_code is functionally necessary so that the call
to nested_svm_exit_handled() checks the correct exit code.
