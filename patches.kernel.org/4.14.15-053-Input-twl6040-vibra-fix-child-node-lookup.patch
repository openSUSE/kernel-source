Subject: [PATCH] Input: twl6040-vibra - fix child-node lookup
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.15
Git-commit: dcaf12a8b0bbdbfcfa2be8dff2c4948d9844b4ad

commit dcaf12a8b0bbdbfcfa2be8dff2c4948d9844b4ad upstream.

Fix child-node lookup during probe, which ended up searching the whole
device tree depth-first starting at parent rather than just matching on
its children.

Later sanity checks on node properties (which would likely be missing)
should prevent this from causing much trouble however, especially as the
original premature free of the parent node has already been fixed
separately (but that "fix" was apparently never backported to stable).

Fixes: e7ec014a47e4 ("Input: twl6040-vibra - update for device tree support")
Fixes: c52c545ead97 ("Input: twl6040-vibra - fix DT node memory management")
