Subject: [PATCH] net/smc: Avoid warning of possible recursive locking
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.7

[ Upstream commit 7a61432dc81375be06b02f0061247d3efbdfce3a ]

Possible recursive locking is detected by lockdep when SMC
falls back to TCP. The corresponding warnings are as follows:

 ============================================
 WARNING: possible recursive locking detected
 5.16.0-rc1+ #18 Tainted: G            E
 --------------------------------------------
 wrk/1391 is trying to acquire lock:
 ffff975246c8e7d8 (&ei->socket.wq.wait){..-.}-{3:3}, at: smc_switch_to_fallback+0x109/0x250 [smc]

 but task is already holding lock:
 ffff975246c8f918 (&ei->socket.wq.wait){..-.}-{3:3}, at: smc_switch_to_fallback+0xfe/0x250 [smc]

 other info that might help us debug this:
  Possible unsafe locking scenario:

        CPU0
        ----
   lock(&ei->socket.wq.wait);
   lock(&ei->socket.wq.wait);

  *** DEADLOCK ***

  May be due to missing lock nesting notation

 2 locks held by wrk/1391:
  #0: ffff975246040130 (sk_lock-AF_SMC){+.+.}-{0:0}, at: smc_connect+0x43/0x150 [smc]
  #1: ffff975246c8f918 (&ei->socket.wq.wait){..-.}-{3:3}, at: smc_switch_to_fallback+0xfe/0x250 [smc]

The nested locking in smc_switch_to_fallback() is considered to
possibly cause a deadlock because smc_wait->lock and clc_wait->lock
are the same type of lock. But actually it is safe so far since
there is no other place trying to obtain smc_wait->lock when
clc_wait->lock is held. So the patch replaces spin_lock() with
spin_lock_nested() to avoid false report by lockdep.
