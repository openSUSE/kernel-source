Subject: [PATCH] gcc-plugins: make it possible to disable CONFIG_GCC_PLUGINS
 again
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.9
Git-commit: a5b0dc5a46c221725c43bd9b01570239a4cd78b1

commit a5b0dc5a46c221725c43bd9b01570239a4cd78b1 upstream.

I noticed that randconfig builds with gcc no longer produce a lot of
ccache hits, unlike with clang, and traced this back to plugins
now being enabled unconditionally if they are supported.

I am now working around this by adding

   export CCACHE_COMPILERCHECK=/usr/bin/size -A %compiler%

to my top-level Makefile. This changes the heuristic that ccache uses
to determine whether the plugins are the same after a 'make clean'.

However, it also seems that being able to just turn off the plugins is
generally useful, at least for build testing it adds noticeable overhead
but does not find a lot of bugs additional bugs, and may be easier for
ccache users than my workaround.
