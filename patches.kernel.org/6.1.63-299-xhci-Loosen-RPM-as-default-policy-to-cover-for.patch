Subject: [PATCH] xhci: Loosen RPM as default policy to cover for AMD xHC 1.1
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.63
Git-commit: 4baf1218150985ee3ab0a27220456a1f027ea0ac

[ Upstream commit 4baf1218150985ee3ab0a27220456a1f027ea0ac ]

The AMD USB host controller (1022:43f7) isn't going into PCI D3 by default
without anything connected. This is because the policy that was introduced
by commit a611bf473d1f ("xhci-pci: Set runtime PM as default policy on all
xHC 1.2 or later devices") only covered 1.2 or later.

The 1.1 specification also has the same requirement as the 1.2
specification for D3 support. So expand the runtime PM as default policy
to all AMD 1.1 devices as well.

Fixes: a611bf473d1f ("xhci-pci: Set runtime PM as default policy on all xHC 1.2 or later devices")
