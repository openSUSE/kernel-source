Subject: [PATCH] ice: Fix for adaptive interrupt moderation
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.6
Git-commit: 64a59d05a4b3ddb37eb5ad3a3be0f17148f449f5

[ Upstream commit 64a59d05a4b3ddb37eb5ad3a3be0f17148f449f5 ]

commit 63f545ed1285 ("ice: Add support for adaptive interrupt moderation")
was meant to add support for adaptive interrupt moderation but there was
an error on my part while formatting the patch, and thus only part of the
patch ended up being submitted.

This patch rectifies the error by adding the rest of the code.

Fixes: 63f545ed1285 ("ice: Add support for adaptive interrupt moderation")
