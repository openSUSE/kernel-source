Subject: [PATCH] driver core: platform: Don't read past the end of
 "driver_override" buffer
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.13.6
Git-commit: bf563b01c2895a4bfd1a29cc5abc67fe706ecffd

commit bf563b01c2895a4bfd1a29cc5abc67fe706ecffd upstream.

When printing the driver_override parameter when it is 4095 and 4094 bytes
long, the printing code would access invalid memory because we need count+1
bytes for printing.

Reject driver_override values of these lengths in driver_override_store().

This is in close analogy to commit 4efe874aace5 ("PCI: Don't read past the
end of sysfs "driver_override" buffer") from Sasha Levin.

Fixes: 3d713e0e382e ("driver core: platform: add device binding path 'driver_override'")
