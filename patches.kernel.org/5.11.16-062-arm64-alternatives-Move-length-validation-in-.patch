Subject: [PATCH] arm64: alternatives: Move length validation in
 alternative_{insn, endif}
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.16
Git-commit: 22315a2296f4c251fa92aec45fbbae37e9301b6c

commit 22315a2296f4c251fa92aec45fbbae37e9301b6c upstream.

After commit 2decad92f473 ("arm64: mte: Ensure TIF_MTE_ASYNC_FAULT is
set atomically"), LLVM's integrated assembler fails to build entry.S:

<instantiation>:5:7: error: expected assembly-time absolute expression
 .org . - (664b-663b) + (662b-661b)
      ^
<instantiation>:6:7: error: expected assembly-time absolute expression
 .org . - (662b-661b) + (664b-663b)
      ^

The root cause is LLVM's assembler has a one-pass design, meaning it
cannot figure out these instruction lengths when the .org directive is
outside of the subsection that they are in, which was changed by the
.arch_extension directive added in the above commit.

Apply the same fix from commit 966a0acce2fc ("arm64/alternatives: move
length validation inside the subsection") to the alternative_endif
macro, shuffling the .org directives so that the length validation
happen will always happen in the same subsections. alternative_insn has
not shown any issue yet but it appears that it could have the same issue
in the future so just preemptively change it.
