Subject: [PATCH] nfp: flower: handle neighbour events on internal ports
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.14
Git-commit: e8024cb483abb2b0290b3ef5e34c736e9de2492f

[ Upstream commit e8024cb483abb2b0290b3ef5e34c736e9de2492f ]

Recent code changes to NFP allowed the offload of neighbour entries to FW
when the next hop device was an internal port. This allows for offload of
tunnel encap when the end-point IP address is applied to such a port.

Unfortunately, the neighbour event handler still rejects events that are
not associated with a repr dev and so the firmware neighbour table may get
out of sync for internal ports.

Fix this by allowing internal port neighbour events to be correctly
processed.
