Subject: [PATCH] igb: clear out skb->tstamp after reading the txtime
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.3
Git-commit: 1e08511d5d01884a3c9070afd52a47799312074a

[ Upstream commit 1e08511d5d01884a3c9070afd52a47799312074a ]

If a packet which is utilizing the launchtime feature (via SO_TXTIME socket
option) also requests the hardware transmit timestamp, the hardware
timestamp is not delivered to the userspace. This is because the value in
skb->tstamp is mistaken as the software timestamp.

Applications, like ptp4l, request a hardware timestamp by setting the
SOF_TIMESTAMPING_TX_HARDWARE socket option. Whenever a new timestamp is
detected by the driver (this work is done in igb_ptp_tx_work() which calls
igb_ptp_tx_hwtstamps() in igb_ptp.c[1]), it will queue the timestamp in the
ERR_QUEUE for the userspace to read. When the userspace is ready, it will
issue a recvmsg() call to collect this timestamp.  The problem is in this
recvmsg() call. If the skb->tstamp is not cleared out, it will be
interpreted as a software timestamp and the hardware tx timestamp will not
be successfully sent to the userspace. Look at skb_is_swtx_tstamp() and the
callee function __sock_recv_timestamp() in net/socket.c for more details.
