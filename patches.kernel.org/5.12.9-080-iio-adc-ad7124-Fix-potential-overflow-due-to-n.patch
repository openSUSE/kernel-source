Subject: [PATCH] iio: adc: ad7124: Fix potential overflow due to non
 sequential channel numbers
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.9
Git-commit: f2a772c51206b0c3f262e4f6a3812c89a650191b

commit f2a772c51206b0c3f262e4f6a3812c89a650191b upstream.

Channel numbering must start at 0 and then not have any holes, or
it is possible to overflow the available storage.  Note this bug was
introduced as part of a fix to ensure we didn't rely on the ordering
of child nodes.  So we need to support arbitrary ordering but they all
need to be there somewhere.

Note I hit this when using qemu to test the rest of this series.
Arguably this isn't the best fix, but it is probably the most minimal
option for backporting etc.

Alexandru's sign-off is here because he carried this patch in a larger
set that Jonathan then applied.
