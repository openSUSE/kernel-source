Subject: [PATCH] net/mlx5e: Fix tc acts array not to be dependent on enum
 order
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.9
Git-commit: 08912ea799cd2a43b8999457e316967fe4e2f327

[ Upstream commit 08912ea799cd2a43b8999457e316967fe4e2f327 ]

The tc acts array should not be dependent on kernel internal
flow action id enum. Fix the array initialization.
