Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: qgroup: fix deadlock between rescan worker and remove
 qgroup
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.16.13
Git-commit: d4aef1e122d8bbdc15ce3bd0bc813d6b44a7d63a

commit d4aef1e122d8bbdc15ce3bd0bc813d6b44a7d63a upstream.

The commit e804861bd4e6 ("btrfs: fix deadlock between quota disable and
qgroup rescan worker") by Kawasaki resolves deadlock between quota
disable and qgroup rescan worker. But also there is a deadlock case like
it. It's about enabling or disabling quota and creating or removing
qgroup. It can be reproduced in simple script below.

for i in {1..100}
do
    btrfs quota enable /mnt &
    btrfs qgroup create 1/0 /mnt &
    btrfs qgroup destroy 1/0 /mnt &
    btrfs quota disable /mnt &
done

Here's why the deadlock happens:

1) The quota rescan task is running.

2) Task A calls btrfs_quota_disable(), locks the qgroup_ioctl_lock
   mutex, and then calls btrfs_qgroup_wait_for_completion(), to wait for
   the quota rescan task to complete.

3) Task B calls btrfs_remove_qgroup() and it blocks when trying to lock
   the qgroup_ioctl_lock mutex, because it's being held by task A. At that
   point task B is holding a transaction handle for the current transaction.

4) The quota rescan task calls btrfs_commit_transaction(). This results
   in it waiting for all other tasks to release their handles on the
   transaction, but task B is blocked on the qgroup_ioctl_lock mutex
   while holding a handle on the transaction, and that mutex is being held
   by task A, which is waiting for the quota rescan task to complete,
   resulting in a deadlock between these 3 tasks.

To resolve this issue, the thread disabling quota should unlock
qgroup_ioctl_lock before waiting rescan completion. Move
btrfs_qgroup_wait_for_completion() after unlock of qgroup_ioctl_lock.
