Subject: [PATCH] blk-iocost: avoid 64-bit division in ioc_timer_fn
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.28
Git-commit: 5f2779dfa7b8cc7dfd4a1b6586d86e0d193266f3

commit 5f2779dfa7b8cc7dfd4a1b6586d86e0d193266f3 upstream.

The behavior of 'enum' types has changed in gcc-13, so now the
UNBUSY_THR_PCT constant is interpreted as a 64-bit number because
it is defined as part of the same enum definition as some other
constants that do not fit within a 32-bit integer. This in turn
leads to some inefficient code on 32-bit architectures as well
as a link error:

arm-linux-gnueabi/bin/arm-linux-gnueabi-ld: block/blk-iocost.o: in function `ioc_timer_fn':
blk-iocost.c:(.text+0x68e8): undefined reference to `__aeabi_uldivmod'
arm-linux-gnueabi-ld: blk-iocost.c:(.text+0x6908): undefined reference to `__aeabi_uldivmod'

Split the enum definition to keep the 64-bit timing constants in
a separate enum type from those constants that can clearly fit
within a smaller type.
