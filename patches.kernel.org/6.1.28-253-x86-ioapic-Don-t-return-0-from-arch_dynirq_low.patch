Subject: [PATCH] x86/ioapic: Don't return 0 from arch_dynirq_lower_bound()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.28
Git-commit: 5af507bef93c09a94fb8f058213b489178f4cbe5

[ Upstream commit 5af507bef93c09a94fb8f058213b489178f4cbe5 ]

arch_dynirq_lower_bound() is invoked by the core interrupt code to
retrieve the lowest possible Linux interrupt number for dynamically
allocated interrupts like MSI.

The x86 implementation uses this to exclude the IO/APIC GSI space.
This works correctly as long as there is an IO/APIC registered, but
returns 0 if not. This has been observed in VMs where the BIOS does
not advertise an IO/APIC.

0 is an invalid interrupt number except for the legacy timer interrupt
on x86. The return value is unchecked in the core code, so it ends up
to allocate interrupt number 0 which is subsequently considered to be
invalid by the caller, e.g. the MSI allocation code.

The function has already a check for 0 in the case that an IO/APIC is
registered, as ioapic_dynirq_base is 0 in case of device tree setups.

Consolidate this and zero check for both ioapic_dynirq_base and gsi_top,
which is used in the case that no IO/APIC is registered.
