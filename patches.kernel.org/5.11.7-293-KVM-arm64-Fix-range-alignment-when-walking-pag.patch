Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm64: Fix range alignment when walking page tables
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.7
Git-commit: 357ad203d45c0f9d76a8feadbd5a1c5d460c638b

commit 357ad203d45c0f9d76a8feadbd5a1c5d460c638b upstream.

When walking the page tables at a given level, and if the start
address for the range isn't aligned for that level, we propagate
the misalignment on each iteration at that level.

This results in the walker ignoring a number of entries (depending
on the original misalignment) on each subsequent iteration.

Properly aligning the address before the next iteration addresses
this issue.
