Subject: [PATCH] PCI/PM: Observe reset delay irrespective of bridge_d3
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: 8ef0217227b42e2c34a18de316cee3da16c9bf1e

commit 8ef0217227b42e2c34a18de316cee3da16c9bf1e upstream.

If a PCI bridge is suspended to D3cold upon entering system sleep,
resuming it entails a Fundamental Reset per PCIe r6.0 sec 5.8.

The delay prescribed after a Fundamental Reset in PCIe r6.0 sec 6.6.1
is sought to be observed by:

  pci_pm_resume_noirq()
    pci_pm_bridge_power_up_actions()
      pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus()

However, pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus() bails out if the bridge_d3
flag is not set.  That flag indicates whether a bridge is allowed to
suspend to D3cold at *runtime*.

Hence *no* delay is observed on resume from system sleep if runtime
D3cold is forbidden.  That doesn't make any sense, so drop the bridge_d3
check from pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus().

The purpose of the bridge_d3 check was probably to avoid delays if a
bridge remained in D0 during suspend.  However the sole caller of
pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus(), pci_pm_bridge_power_up_actions(),
is only invoked if the previous power state was D3cold.  Hence the
additional bridge_d3 check seems superfluous.
