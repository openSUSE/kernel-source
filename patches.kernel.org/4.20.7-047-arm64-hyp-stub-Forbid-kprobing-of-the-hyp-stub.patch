Subject: [PATCH] arm64: hyp-stub: Forbid kprobing of the hyp-stub
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.7
Git-commit: 8fac5cbdfe0f01254d9d265c6aa1a95f94f58595

commit 8fac5cbdfe0f01254d9d265c6aa1a95f94f58595 upstream.

The hyp-stub is loaded by the kernel's early startup code at EL2
during boot, before KVM takes ownership later. The hyp-stub's
text is part of the regular kernel text, meaning it can be kprobed.

A breakpoint in the hyp-stub causes the CPU to spin in el2_sync_invalid.

Add it to the __hyp_text.
