Subject: [PATCH] net: lapb: Copy the skb before sending a packet
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.15
Git-commit: 88c7a9fd9bdd3e453f04018920964c6f848a591a

[ Upstream commit 88c7a9fd9bdd3e453f04018920964c6f848a591a ]

When sending a packet, we will prepend it with an LAPB header.
This modifies the shared parts of a cloned skb, so we should copy the
skb rather than just clone it, before we prepend the header.

In "Documentation/networking/driver.rst" (the 2nd point), it states
that drivers shouldn't modify the shared parts of a cloned skb when
transmitting.

The "dev_queue_xmit_nit" function in "net/core/dev.c", which is called
when an skb is being sent, clones the skb and sents the clone to
AF_PACKET sockets. Because the LAPB drivers first remove a 1-byte
pseudo-header before handing over the skb to us, if we don't copy the
skb before prepending the LAPB header, the first byte of the packets
received on AF_PACKET sockets can be corrupted.
