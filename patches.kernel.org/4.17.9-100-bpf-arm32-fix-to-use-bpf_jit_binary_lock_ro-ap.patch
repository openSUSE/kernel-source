Subject: [PATCH] bpf, arm32: fix to use bpf_jit_binary_lock_ro api
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.9
Git-commit: 18d405af30bf6506bf2fc49056de7691c949812e

commit 18d405af30bf6506bf2fc49056de7691c949812e upstream.

Any eBPF JIT that where its underlying arch supports ARCH_HAS_SET_MEMORY
would need to use bpf_jit_binary_{un,}lock_ro() pair instead of the
set_memory_{ro,rw}() pair directly as otherwise changes to the former
might break. arm32's eBPF conversion missed to change it, so fix this
up here.
