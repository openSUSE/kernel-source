Subject: [PATCH] wifi: ath5k: fix an off by one check in
 ath5k_eeprom_read_freq_list()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.28
Git-commit: 4c856ee12df85aabd437c3836ed9f68d94268358

[ Upstream commit 4c856ee12df85aabd437c3836ed9f68d94268358 ]

This loop checks that i < max at the start of loop but then it does
i++ which could put it past the end of the array.  It's harmless to
check again and prevent a potential out of bounds.
