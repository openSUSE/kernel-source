Subject: [PATCH] jbd2: do not try to recover wiped journal
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.31
Git-commit: a662f3c03b754e1f97a2781fa242e95bdb139798

[ Upstream commit a662f3c03b754e1f97a2781fa242e95bdb139798 ]

If a journal is wiped, we will set journal->j_tail to 0. However if
'write' argument is not set (as it happens for read-only device or for
ocfs2), the on-disk superblock is not updated accordingly and thus
jbd2_journal_recover() cat try to recover the wiped journal. Fix the
check in jbd2_journal_recover() to use journal->j_tail for checking
empty journal instead.
