Subject: [PATCH] KVM: nSVM: Don't strip host's C-bit from guest's CR3 when
 reading PDPTRs
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.3
Git-commit: 2732be90235347a3be4babdc9f88a1ea93970b0b

[ Upstream commit 2732be90235347a3be4babdc9f88a1ea93970b0b ]

Don't clear the SME C-bit when reading a guest PDPTR, as the GPA (CR3) is
in the guest domain.

Barring a bizarre paravirtual use case, this is likely a benign bug.  SME
is not emulated by KVM, loading SEV guest PDPTRs is doomed as KVM can't
use the correct key to read guest memory, and setting guest MAXPHYADDR
higher than the host, i.e. overlapping the C-bit, would cause faults in
the guest.

Note, for SEV guests, stripping the C-bit is technically aligned with CPU
behavior, but for KVM it's the greater of two evils.  Because KVM doesn't
have access to the guest's encryption key, ignoring the C-bit would at
best result in KVM reading garbage.  By keeping the C-bit, KVM will
fail its read (unless userspace creates a memslot with the C-bit set).
The guest will still undoubtedly die, as KVM will use '0' for the PDPTR
value, but that's preferable to interpreting encrypted data as a PDPTR.
