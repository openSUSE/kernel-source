Subject: [PATCH] drm/probe-helper: Cancel previous job before starting new one
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.28
Git-commit: a8e47884f1906cd7440fafa056adc8817568e73e

[ Upstream commit a8e47884f1906cd7440fafa056adc8817568e73e ]

Currently we schedule a call to output_poll_execute from
drm_kms_helper_poll_enable for 10s in future. Later we try to replace
that in drm_helper_probe_single_connector_modes with a 0s schedule with
delayed_event set.

But as there is already a job in the queue this fails, and the immediate
job we wanted with delayed_event set doesn't occur until 10s later.

And that call acts as if connector state has changed, reprobing modes.
This has a side effect of waking up a display that has been blanked.

Make sure we cancel the old job before submitting the immediate one.
