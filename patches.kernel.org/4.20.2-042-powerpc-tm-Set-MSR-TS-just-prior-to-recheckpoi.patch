Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/tm: Set MSR[TS] just prior to recheckpoint
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.2
Git-commit: e1c3743e1a20647c53b719dbf28b48f45d23f2cd

commit e1c3743e1a20647c53b719dbf28b48f45d23f2cd upstream.

On a signal handler return, the user could set a context with MSR[TS] bits
set, and these bits would be copied to task regs->msr.

At restore_tm_sigcontexts(), after current task regs->msr[TS] bits are set,
several __get_user() are called and then a recheckpoint is executed.

This is a problem since a page fault (in kernel space) could happen when
calling __get_user(). If it happens, the process MSR[TS] bits were
already set, but recheckpoint was not executed, and SPRs are still invalid.

The page fault can cause the current process to be de-scheduled, with
MSR[TS] active and without tm_recheckpoint() being called.  More
importantly, without TEXASR[FS] bit set also.

Since TEXASR might not have the FS bit set, and when the process is
scheduled back, it will try to reclaim, which will be aborted because of
the CPU is not in the suspended state, and, then, recheckpoint. This
recheckpoint will restore thread->texasr into TEXASR SPR, which might be
zero, hitting a BUG_ON().

This patch simply delays the MSR[TS] set, so, if there is any page fault in
the __get_user() section, it does not have regs->msr[TS] set, since the TM
structures are still invalid, thus avoiding doing TM operations for
in-kernel exceptions and possible process reschedule.

With this patch, the MSR[TS] will only be set just before recheckpointing
and setting TEXASR[FS] = 1, thus avoiding an interrupt with TM registers in
invalid state.

Other than that, if CONFIG_PREEMPT is set, there might be a preemption just
after setting MSR[TS] and before tm_recheckpoint(), thus, this block must
be atomic from a preemption perspective, thus, calling
preempt_disable/enable() on this code.

It is not possible to move tm_recheckpoint to happen earlier, because it is
required to get the checkpointed registers from userspace, with
__get_user(), thus, the only way to avoid this undesired behavior is
delaying the MSR[TS] set.

The 32-bits signal handler seems to be safe this current issue, but, it
might be exposed to the preemption issue, thus, disabling preemption in
this chunk of code.

Changes from v2:
 * Run the critical section with preempt_disable.
