Subject: [PATCH] IB/hfi1: Drop all TID RDMA READ RESP packets after r_next_psn
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.7
Git-commit: f4d46119f214f9a7620b0d18b153d7e0e8c90b4f

commit f4d46119f214f9a7620b0d18b153d7e0e8c90b4f upstream.

When a TID sequence error occurs while receiving TID RDMA READ RESP
packets, all packets after flow->flow_state.r_next_psn should be dropped,
including those response packets for subsequent segments.

The current implementation will drop the subsequent response packets for
the segment to complete next, but may accept packets for subsequent
segments and therefore mistakenly advance the r_next_psn fields for the
corresponding software flows. This may result in failures to complete
subsequent segments after the current segment is completed.

The fix is to only use the flow pointed by req->clear_tail for checking
KDETH PSN instead of finding a flow from the request's flow array.

Fixes: b885d5be9ca1 ("IB/hfi1: Unify the software PSN check for TID RDMA READ/WRITE")
