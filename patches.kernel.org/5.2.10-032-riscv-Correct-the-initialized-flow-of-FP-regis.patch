Subject: [PATCH] riscv: Correct the initialized flow of FP register
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.10
Git-commit: 8ac71d7e46b94a4fc8ffc6f1c88004cdf24459e8

commit 8ac71d7e46b94a4fc8ffc6f1c88004cdf24459e8 upstream.

  The following two reasons cause FP registers are sometimes not
initialized before starting the user program.
1. Currently, the FP context is initialized in flush_thread() function
   and we expect these initial values to be restored to FP register when
   doing FP context switch. However, the FP context switch only occurs in
   switch_to function. Hence, if this process does not be scheduled out
   and scheduled in before entering the user space, the FP registers
   have no chance to initialize.
2. In flush_thread(), the state of reg->sstatus.FS inherits from the
   parent. Hence, the state of reg->sstatus.FS may be dirty. If this
   process is scheduled out during flush_thread() and initializing the
   FP register, the fstate_save() in switch_to will corrupt the FP context
   which has been initialized until flush_thread().

  To solve the 1st case, the initialization of the FP register will be
completed in start_thread(). It makes sure all FP registers are initialized
before starting the user program. For the 2nd case, the state of
reg->sstatus.FS in start_thread will be set to SR_FS_OFF to prevent this
process from corrupting FP context in doing context save. The FP state is
set to SR_FS_INITIAL in start_trhead().
