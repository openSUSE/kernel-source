Subject: [PATCH] igc: fix race condition in TX timestamp read for register 0
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.8
Git-commit: 6990dc392a9ab10e52af37e0bee8c7b753756dc4

[ Upstream commit 6990dc392a9ab10e52af37e0bee8c7b753756dc4 ]

The current HW bug workaround checks the TXTT_0 ready bit first,
then reads TXSTMPL_0 twice (before and after reading TXSTMPH_0)
to detect whether a new timestamp was captured by timestamp
register 0 during the workaround.

This sequence has a race: if a new timestamp is captured after
checking the TXTT_0 bit but before the first TXSTMPL_0 read, the
detection fails because both the "old" and "new" values come from
the same timestamp.

Fix by reading TXSTMPL_0 first to establish a baseline, then
checking the TXTT_0 bit. This ensures any timestamp captured
during the race window will be detected.

Old sequence:
  1. Check TXTT_0 ready bit
  2. Read TXSTMPL_0 (baseline)
  3. Read TXSTMPH_0 (interrupt workaround)
  4. Read TXSTMPL_0 (detect changes vs baseline)

New sequence:
  1. Read TXSTMPL_0 (baseline)
  2. Check TXTT_0 ready bit
  3. Read TXSTMPH_0 (interrupt workaround)
  4. Read TXSTMPL_0 (detect changes vs baseline)
