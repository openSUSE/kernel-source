Subject: [PATCH] nvme-loop: do not warn for deleted controllers during reset
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.12
Git-commit: 6622f9acd29cd4f6272720e827e6406f5a970cb0

[ Upstream commit 6622f9acd29cd4f6272720e827e6406f5a970cb0 ]

During concurrent reset and delete calls the reset workqueue is
flushed, causing nvme_loop_reset_ctrl_work() to be executed when
the controller is in state DELETING or DELETING_NOIO.
But this is expected, so we shouldn't issue a WARN_ON here.
