Subject: [PATCH] drivers/pps/pps.c: clear offset flags in PPS_SETPARAMS ioctl
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.6
Git-commit: 5515e9a6273b8c02034466bcbd717ac9f53dab99

commit 5515e9a6273b8c02034466bcbd717ac9f53dab99 upstream.

The PPS assert/clear offset corrections are set by the PPS_SETPARAMS
ioctl in the pps_ktime structs, which also contain flags.  The flags are
not initialized by applications (using the timepps.h header) and they
are not used by the kernel for anything except returning them back in
the PPS_GETPARAMS ioctl.

Set the flags to zero to make it clear they are unused and avoid leaking
uninitialized data of the PPS_SETPARAMS caller to other applications
that have a read access to the PPS device.
