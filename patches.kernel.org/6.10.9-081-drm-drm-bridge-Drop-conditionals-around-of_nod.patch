Subject: [PATCH] drm/drm-bridge: Drop conditionals around of_node pointers
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.9
Git-commit: ad3323a6ccb7d43bbeeaa46d5311c43d5d361fc7

[ Upstream commit ad3323a6ccb7d43bbeeaa46d5311c43d5d361fc7 ]

Having conditional around the of_node pointer of the drm_bridge structure
is not necessary, since drm_bridge structure always has the of_node as its
member.

Let's drop the conditional to get a better looks, please also note that
this is following the already accepted commitments. see commit d8dfccde2709
("drm/bridge: Drop conditionals around of_node pointers") for reference.
