Subject: [PATCH] fs-verity: fix signed integer overflow with i_size near
 S64_MAX
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.10
Git-commit: 80f6e3080bfcf865062a926817b3ca6c4a137a57

commit 80f6e3080bfcf865062a926817b3ca6c4a137a57 upstream.

If the file size is almost S64_MAX, the calculated number of Merkle tree
levels exceeds FS_VERITY_MAX_LEVELS, causing FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY to
fail.  This is unintentional, since as the comment above the definition
of FS_VERITY_MAX_LEVELS states, it is enough for over U64_MAX bytes of
data using SHA-256 and 4K blocks.  (Specifically, 4096*128**8 >= 2**64.)

The bug is actually that when the number of blocks in the first level is
calculated from i_size, there is a signed integer overflow due to i_size
being signed.  Fix this by treating i_size as unsigned.

This was found by the new test "generic: test fs-verity EFBIG scenarios"
(https://lkml.kernel.org/r/b1d116cd4d0ea74b9cd86f349c672021e005a75c.1631558495.git.boris@bur.io).

This didn't affect ext4 or f2fs since those have a smaller maximum file
size, but it did affect btrfs which allows files up to S64_MAX bytes.
