commit 63f3655f950186752236bb88a22f8252c11ce394 upstream.

Liu Bo has experienced a deadlock between memcg (legacy) reclaim and the
ext4 writeback

    __do_page_fault+0x252/0x4d0
    do_page_fault+0x30/0x80
    page_fault+0x28/0x30

  task2:
    __lock_page+0x86/0xa0
    mpage_prepare_extent_to_map+0x2e7/0x310 [ext4]
    ext4_writepages+0x479/0xd60
    do_writepages+0x1e/0x30
    __writeback_single_inode+0x45/0x320
    writeback_sb_inodes+0x272/0x600

    wb_writeback+0x268/0x300
    wb_workfn+0xb4/0x390

    worker_thread+0x4e/0x4b0
    kthread+0xe6/0x100
    ret_from_fork+0x41/0x50

He adds
 "task1 is waiting for the PageWriteback bit of the page that task2 has
  collected in mpd->io_submit->io_bio, and tasks2 is waiting for the
  LOCKED bit the page which tasks1 has locked"

More precisely task1 is handling a page fault and it has a page locked
while it charges a new page table to a memcg.  That in turn hits a
memory limit reclaim and the memcg reclaim for legacy controller is
waiting on the writeback but that is never going to finish because the
writeback itself is waiting for the page locked in the #PF path.  So
this is essentially ABBA deadlock:

                                        lock_page(A)
                                        SetPageWriteback(A)
                                        unlock_page(A)
  lock_page(B)
                                        lock_page(B)
  pte_alloc_pne
    shrink_page_list
      wait_on_page_writeback(A)
                                        SetPageWriteback(B)
                                        unlock_page(B)

                                        # flush A, B to clear the writeback

This accumulating of more pages to flush is used by several filesystems
to generate a more optimal IO patterns.

Waiting for the writeback in legacy memcg controller is a workaround for
pre-mature OOM killer invocations because there is no dirty IO
throttling available for the controller.  There is no easy way around
that unfortunately.  Therefore fix this specific issue by pre-allocating
the page table outside of the page lock.  We have that handy
infrastructure for that already so simply reuse the fault-around pattern
which already does this.

There are probably other hidden __GFP_ACCOUNT | GFP_KERNEL allocations
from under a fs page locked but they should be really rare.  I am not
aware of a better solution unfortunately.
