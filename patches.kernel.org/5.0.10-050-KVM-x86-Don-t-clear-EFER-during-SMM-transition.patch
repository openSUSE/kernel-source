Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: Don't clear EFER during SMM transitions for 32-bit
 vCPU
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.10
Git-commit: 8f4dc2e77cdfaf7e644ef29693fa229db29ee1de

commit 8f4dc2e77cdfaf7e644ef29693fa229db29ee1de upstream.

Neither AMD nor Intel CPUs have an EFER field in the legacy SMRAM save
state area, i.e. don't save/restore EFER across SMM transitions.  KVM
somewhat models this, e.g. doesn't clear EFER on entry to SMM if the
guest doesn't support long mode.  But during RSM, KVM unconditionally
clears EFER so that it can get back to pure 32-bit mode in order to
start loading CRs with their actual non-SMM values.

Clear EFER only when it will be written when loading the non-SMM state
so as to preserve bits that can theoretically be set on 32-bit vCPUs,
e.g. KVM always emulates EFER_SCE.

And because CR4.PAE is cleared only to play nice with EFER, wrap that
code in the long mode check as well.  Note, this may result in a
compiler warning about cr4 being consumed uninitialized.  Re-read CR4
even though it's technically unnecessary, as doing so allows for more
readable code and RSM emulation is not a performance critical path.
