Subject: [PATCH] mm: migrate: fix an incorrect call of prep_transhuge_page()

commit 40a899ed16486455f964e46d1af31fd4fded21c1 upstream.

In https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/11/20/411, Andrea reported that during
memory hotplug/hot remove prep_transhuge_page() is called incorrectly on
non-THP pages for migration, when THP is on but THP migration is not
enabled.  This leads to a bad state of target pages for migration.

By inspecting the code, if called on a non-THP, prep_transhuge_page()
will

 1) change the value of the mapping of (page + 2), since it is used for
    THP deferred list;

 2) change the lru value of (page + 1), since it is used for THP's dtor.

Both can lead to data corruption of these two pages.

Andrea said:
 "Pragmatically and from the point of view of the memory_hotplug subsys,
  the effect is a kernel crash when pages are being migrated during a
  memory hot remove offline and migration target pages are found in a
  bad state"

This patch fixes it by only calling prep_transhuge_page() when we are
certain that the target page is THP.
