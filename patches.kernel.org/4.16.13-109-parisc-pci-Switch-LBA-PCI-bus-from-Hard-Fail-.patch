Subject: [PATCH] parisc/pci: Switch LBA PCI bus from Hard Fail to Soft Fail
 mode
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.13
Git-commit: b845f66f78bf42a4ce98e5cfe0e94fab41dd0742

[ Upstream commit b845f66f78bf42a4ce98e5cfe0e94fab41dd0742 ]

Carlo Pisani noticed that his C3600 workstation behaved unstable during heavy
I/O on the PCI bus with a VIA VT6421 IDE/SATA PCI card.

To avoid such instability, this patch switches the LBA PCI bus from Hard Fail
mode into Soft Fail mode. In this mode the bus will return -1UL for timed out
MMIO transactions, which is exactly how the x86 (and most other architectures)
PCI busses behave.

This patch is based on a proposal by Grant Grundler and Kyle McMartin 10
years ago:
