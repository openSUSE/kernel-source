Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm/arm64: Fix handling of stage2 huge mappings
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.12
Git-commit: 3c3736cd32bf5197aed1410ae826d2d254a5b277

[ Upstream commit 3c3736cd32bf5197aed1410ae826d2d254a5b277 ]

We rely on the mmu_notifier call backs to handle the split/merge
of huge pages and thus we are guaranteed that, while creating a
block mapping, either the entire block is unmapped at stage2 or it
is missing permission.

However, we miss a case where the block mapping is split for dirty
logging case and then could later be made block mapping, if we cancel the
dirty logging. This not only creates inconsistent TLB entries for
the pages in the the block, but also leakes the table pages for
PMD level.

Handle this corner case for the huge mappings at stage2 by
unmapping the non-huge mapping for the block. This could potentially
release the upper level table. So we need to restart the table walk
once we unmap the range.
