Subject: [PATCH] rbd: whitelist RBD_FEATURE_OPERATIONS feature bit
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.5
Git-commit: e573427a440fd67d3f522357d7ac901d59281948

commit e573427a440fd67d3f522357d7ac901d59281948 upstream.

This feature bit restricts older clients from performing certain
maintenance operations against an image (e.g. clone, snap create).
krbd does not perform maintenance operations.
