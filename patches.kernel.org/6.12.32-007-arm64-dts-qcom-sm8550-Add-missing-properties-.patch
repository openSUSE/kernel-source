Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sm8550: Add missing properties for
 cryptobam
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.32
Git-commit: 663cd2cad36da23cf1a3db7868fce9f1a19b2d61

commit 663cd2cad36da23cf1a3db7868fce9f1a19b2d61 upstream.

num-channels and qcom,num-ees are required for BAM nodes without clock,
because the driver cannot ensure the hardware is powered on when trying to
obtain the information from the hardware registers. Specifying the node
without these properties is unsafe and has caused early boot crashes for
other SoCs before [1, 2].

Add the missing information from the hardware registers to ensure the
driver can probe successfully without causing crashes.
