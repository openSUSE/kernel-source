Subject: [PATCH] timers: Clear timer_base::must_forward_clk with
 timer_base::lock held
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.9
Git-commit: 363e934d8811d799c88faffc5bfca782fd728334

[ Upstream commit 363e934d8811d799c88faffc5bfca782fd728334 ]

timer_base::must_forward_clock is indicating that the base clock might be
stale due to a long idle sleep.

The forwarding of the base clock takes place in the timer softirq or when a
timer is enqueued to a base which is idle. If the enqueue of timer to an
idle base happens from a remote CPU, then the following race can happen:

  CPU0					CPU1
  run_timer_softirq			mod_timer

					base = lock_timer_base(timer);
  base->must_forward_clk = false
					if (base->must_forward_clk)
				       	    forward(base); -> skipped

					enqueue_timer(base, timer, idx);
					-> idx is calculated high due to
					   stale base
					unlock_timer_base(timer);
  base = lock_timer_base(timer);
  forward(base);

The root cause is that timer_base::must_forward_clk is cleared outside the
timer_base::lock held region, so the remote queuing CPU observes it as
cleared, but the base clock is still stale. This can cause large
granularity values for timers, i.e. the accuracy of the expiry time
suffers.

Prevent this by clearing the flag with timer_base::lock held, so that the
forwarding takes place before the cleared flag is observable by a remote
CPU.
