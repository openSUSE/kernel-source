Subject: [PATCH] torture: Fix hang during kthread shutdown phase
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: d52d3a2bf408ff86f3a79560b5cce80efb340239

commit d52d3a2bf408ff86f3a79560b5cce80efb340239 upstream.

During rcutorture shutdown, the rcu_torture_cleanup() function calls
torture_cleanup_begin(), which sets the fullstop global variable to
FULLSTOP_RMMOD. This causes the rcutorture threads for readers and
fakewriters to exit all of their "while" loops and start shutting down.

They then call torture_kthread_stopping(), which in turn waits for
kthread_stop() to be called.  However, rcu_torture_cleanup() has
not yet called kthread_stop() on those threads, and before it gets a
chance to do so, multiple instances of torture_kthread_stopping() invoke
schedule_timeout_interruptible(1) in a tight loop.  Tracing confirms that
TIMER_SOFTIRQ can then continuously execute timer callbacks.  If that
TIMER_SOFTIRQ preempts the task executing rcu_torture_cleanup(), that
task might never invoke kthread_stop().

This commit improves this situation by increasing the timeout passed to
schedule_timeout_interruptible() from one jiffy to 1/20th of a second.
This change prevents TIMER_SOFTIRQ from monopolizing its CPU, thus
allowing rcu_torture_cleanup() to carry out the needed kthread_stop()
invocations.  Testing has shown 100 runs of TREE07 passing reliably,
as oppose to the tens-of-percent failure rates seen beforehand.
