Subject: [PATCH] NFC: pn533: fix bulk-message timeout
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.14
Git-commit: a112adafcb47760feff959ee1ecd10b74d2c5467

commit a112adafcb47760feff959ee1ecd10b74d2c5467 upstream.

The driver was doing a synchronous uninterruptible bulk-transfer without
using a timeout. This could lead to the driver hanging on probe due to a
malfunctioning (or malicious) device until the device is physically
disconnected. While sleeping in probe the driver prevents other devices
connected to the same hub from being added to (or removed from) the bus.

An arbitrary limit of five seconds should be more than enough.
