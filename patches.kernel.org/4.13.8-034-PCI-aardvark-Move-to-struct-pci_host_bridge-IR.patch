Subject: [PATCH] PCI: aardvark: Move to struct pci_host_bridge IRQ mapping
 functions
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.13.8
Git-commit: 407dae1e4415acde2d9f48bb76361893c4653756

commit 407dae1e4415acde2d9f48bb76361893c4653756 upstream.

struct pci_host_bridge gained hooks to map/swizzle IRQs, so that the IRQ
mapping can be done automatically by PCI core code through the
pci_assign_irq() function instead of resorting to arch-specific
implementation callbacks to carry out the same task which force PCI host
bridge drivers implementation to implement per-arch kludges to carry out a
task that is inherently architecture agnostic.

Commit 769b461fc0c0 ("arm64: PCI: Drop DT IRQ allocation from
pcibios_alloc_irq()") was assuming all PCI host controller drivers had been
converted to use ->map_irq(), but that wasn't the case: pci-aardvark had
not been converted. Due to this, it broke the support for legacy PCI
interrupts when using the pci-aardvark driver (used on Marvell Armada 3720
platforms).

In order to fix this, we make sure the ->map_irq and ->swizzle_irq fields
of pci_host_bridge are properly filled in.
