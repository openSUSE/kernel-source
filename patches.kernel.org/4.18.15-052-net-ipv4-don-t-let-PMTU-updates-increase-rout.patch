Subject: [PATCH] net: ipv4: don't let PMTU updates increase route MTU
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.15
Git-commit: 28d35bcdd3925e7293408cdb8aa5f2aac5f0d6e3

[ Upstream commit 28d35bcdd3925e7293408cdb8aa5f2aac5f0d6e3 ]

When an MTU update with PMTU smaller than net.ipv4.route.min_pmtu is
received, we must clamp its value. However, we can receive a PMTU
exception with PMTU < old_mtu < ip_rt_min_pmtu, which would lead to an
increase in PMTU.

To fix this, take the smallest of the old MTU and ip_rt_min_pmtu.

Before this patch, in case of an update, the exception's MTU would
always change. Now, an exception can have only its lock flag updated,
but not the MTU, so we need to add a check on locking to the following
"is this exception getting updated, or close to expiring?" test.

Fixes: d52e5a7e7ca4 ("ipv4: lock mtu in fnhe when received PMTU < net.ipv4.route.min_pmtu")
