Subject: [PATCH] perf session: Correct buffer copying when peeking events
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.11
Git-commit: 197eecb6ecae0b04bd694432f640ff75597fed9c

[ Upstream commit 197eecb6ecae0b04bd694432f640ff75597fed9c ]

When peeking an event, it has a short path and a long path.  The short
path uses the session pointer "one_mmap_addr" to directly fetch the
event; and the long path needs to read out the event header and the
following event data from file and fill into the buffer pointer passed
through the argument "buf".

The issue is in the long path that it copies the event header and event
data into the same destination address which pointer "buf", this means
the event header is overwritten.  We are just lucky to run into the
short path in most cases, so we don't hit the issue in the long path.

This patch adds the offset "hdr_sz" to the pointer "buf" when copying
the event data, so that it can reserve the event header which can be
used properly by its caller.
