Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: PM: s2idle: Prevent spurious SCIs from waking up the
 system
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.5
Git-commit: fdde0ff8590b4c1c41b3227f5ac4265fccccb96b

commit fdde0ff8590b4c1c41b3227f5ac4265fccccb96b upstream.

If the platform triggers a spurious SCI even though the status bit
is not set for any GPE when the system is suspended to idle, it will
be treated as a genuine wakeup, so avoid that by checking if any GPEs
are active at all before returning 'true' from acpi_s2idle_wake().
