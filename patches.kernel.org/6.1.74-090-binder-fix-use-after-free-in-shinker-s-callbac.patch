Subject: [PATCH] binder: fix use-after-free in shinker's callback
References: bsc#1218052
Patch-mainline: 6.1.74
Git-commit: 3f489c2067c5824528212b0fc18b28d51332d906

commit 3f489c2067c5824528212b0fc18b28d51332d906 upstream.

The mmap read lock is used during the shrinker's callback, which means
that using alloc->vma pointer isn't safe as it can race with munmap().
As of commit dd2283f2605e ("mm: mmap: zap pages with read mmap_sem in
munmap") the mmap lock is downgraded after the vma has been isolated.

I was able to reproduce this issue by manually adding some delays and
triggering page reclaiming through the shrinker's debug sysfs. The
following KASAN report confirms the UAF:

Fix this issue by performing instead a vma_lookup() which will fail to
find the vma that was isolated before the mmap lock downgrade. Note that
this option has better performance than upgrading to a mmap write lock
which would increase contention. Plus, mmap_write_trylock() has been
recently removed anyway.
