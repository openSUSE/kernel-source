Subject: [PATCH] dma-mapping: benchmark: Restore padding to ensure uABI
 remained consistent
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.59
Git-commit: 23ee8a2563a0f24cf4964685ced23c32be444ab8

commit 23ee8a2563a0f24cf4964685ced23c32be444ab8 upstream.

The padding field in the structure was previously reserved to
maintain a stable interface for potential new fields, ensuring
compatibility with user-space shared data structures.
However,it was accidentally removed by tiantao in a prior commit,
which may lead to incompatibility between user space and the kernel.

This patch reinstates the padding to restore the original structure
layout and preserve compatibility.
