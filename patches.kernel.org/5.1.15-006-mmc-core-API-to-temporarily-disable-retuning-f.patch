Subject: [PATCH] mmc: core: API to temporarily disable retuning for SDIO CRC
 errors
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.15
Git-commit: 0a55f4ab9678413a01e740c86e9367ba0c612b36

commit 0a55f4ab9678413a01e740c86e9367ba0c612b36 upstream.

Normally when the MMC core sees an "-EILSEQ" error returned by a host
controller then it will trigger a retuning of the card.  This is
generally a good idea.

However, if a command is expected to sometimes cause transfer errors
then these transfer errors shouldn't cause a re-tuning.  This
re-tuning will be a needless waste of time.  One example case where a
transfer is expected to cause errors is when transitioning between
idle (sometimes referred to as "sleep" in Broadcom code) and active
state on certain Broadcom WiFi SDIO cards.  Specifically if the card
was already transitioning between states when the command was sent it
could cause an error on the SDIO bus.

Let's add an API that the SDIO function drivers can call that will
temporarily disable the auto-tuning functionality.  Then we can add a
call to this in the Broadcom WiFi driver and any other driver that
might have similar needs.

NOTE: this makes the assumption that the card is already tuned well
enough that it's OK to disable the auto-retuning during one of these
error-prone situations.  Presumably the driver code performing the
error-prone transfer knows how to recover / retry from errors.  ...and
after we can get back to a state where transfers are no longer
error-prone then we can enable the auto-retuning again.  If we truly
find ourselves in a case where the card needs to be retuned sometimes
to handle one of these error-prone transfers then we can always try a
few transfers first without auto-retuning and then re-try with
auto-retuning if the first few fail.

Without this change on rk3288-veyron-minnie I periodically see this in
the logs of a machine just sitting there idle:
  dwmmc_rockchip ff0d0000.dwmmc: Successfully tuned phase to XYZ
