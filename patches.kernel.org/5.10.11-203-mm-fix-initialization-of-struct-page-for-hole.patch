Subject: [PATCH] mm: fix initialization of struct page for holes in memory
 layout
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.11
Git-commit: d3921cb8be29ce5668c64e23ffdaeec5f8c69399

commit d3921cb8be29ce5668c64e23ffdaeec5f8c69399 upstream.

There could be struct pages that are not backed by actual physical
memory.  This can happen when the actual memory bank is not a multiple
of SECTION_SIZE or when an architecture does not register memory holes
reserved by the firmware as memblock.memory.

Such pages are currently initialized using init_unavailable_mem()
function that iterates through PFNs in holes in memblock.memory and if
there is a struct page corresponding to a PFN, the fields if this page
are set to default values and the page is marked as Reserved.

init_unavailable_mem() does not take into account zone and node the page
belongs to and sets both zone and node links in struct page to zero.

On a system that has firmware reserved holes in a zone above ZONE_DMA,
for instance in a configuration below:

	# grep -A1 E820 /proc/iomem
	7a17b000-7a216fff : Unknown E820 type
	7a217000-7bffffff : System RAM

unset zone link in struct page will trigger

	VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(!zone_spans_pfn(page_zone(page), pfn), page);

because there are pages in both ZONE_DMA32 and ZONE_DMA (unset zone link
in struct page) in the same pageblock.

Update init_unavailable_mem() to use zone constraints defined by an
architecture to properly setup the zone link and use node ID of the
adjacent range in memblock.memory to set the node link.

+ *
+ * But, there could be struct pages that correspond to holes in
+ * memblock.memory. This can happen because of the following reasons:
+ * - phyiscal memory bank size is not necessarily the exact multiple of the
+ *   arbitrary section size
+ * - early reserved memory may not be listed in memblock.memory
+ * - memory layouts defined with memmap= kernel parameter may not align
+ *   nicely with memmap sections
  *
- * This function also addresses a similar issue where struct pages are left
- * uninitialized because the physical address range is not covered by
- * memblock.memory or memblock.reserved. That could happen when memblock
- * layout is manually configured via memmap=, or when the highest physical
- * address (max_pfn) does not end on a section boundary.
+ * Explicitly initialize those struct pages so that:

+ * - zone link is set accorging to the architecture constrains
+ * - node is set to node id of the next populated region except for the
