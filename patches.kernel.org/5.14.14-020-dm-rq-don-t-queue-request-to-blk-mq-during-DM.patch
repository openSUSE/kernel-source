Subject: [PATCH] dm rq: don't queue request to blk-mq during DM suspend
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.14
Git-commit: b4459b11e84092658fa195a2587aff3b9637f0e7

commit b4459b11e84092658fa195a2587aff3b9637f0e7 upstream.

DM uses blk-mq's quiesce/unquiesce to stop/start device mapper queue.

But blk-mq's unquiesce may come from outside events, such as elevator
switch, updating nr_requests or others, and request may come during
suspend, so simply ask for blk-mq to requeue it.

Fixes one kernel panic issue when running updating nr_requests and
dm-mpath suspend/resume stress test.
