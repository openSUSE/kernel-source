Subject: [PATCH] Btrfs: ensure path name is null terminated at
 btrfs_control_ioctl
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.7
Git-commit: f505754fd6599230371cb01b9332754ddc104be1

commit f505754fd6599230371cb01b9332754ddc104be1 upstream.

We were using the path name received from user space without checking that
it is null terminated. While btrfs-progs is well behaved and does proper
validation and null termination, someone could call the ioctl and pass
a non-null terminated patch, leading to buffer overrun problems in the
kernel.  The ioctl is protected by CAP_SYS_ADMIN.

So just set the last byte of the path to a null character, similar to what
we do in other ioctls (add/remove/resize device, snapshot creation, etc).
