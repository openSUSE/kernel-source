Subject: [PATCH] nvme-fc: set NVME_REQ_CANCELLED in
 nvme_fc_terminate_exchange()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.11
Git-commit: 3c7aafbc8d3d4d90430dfa126847a796c3e4ecfc

[ Upstream commit 3c7aafbc8d3d4d90430dfa126847a796c3e4ecfc ]

nvme_fc_terminate_exchange() is being called when exchanges are
being deleted, and as such we should be setting the NVME_REQ_CANCELLED
flag to have identical behaviour on all transports.
