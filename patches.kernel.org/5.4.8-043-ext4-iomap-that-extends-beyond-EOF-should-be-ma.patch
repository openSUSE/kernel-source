Subject: [PATCH] ext4: iomap that extends beyond EOF should be marked dirty
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.8
Git-commit: 2e9b51d78229d5145725a481bb5464ebc0a3f9b2

[ Upstream commit 2e9b51d78229d5145725a481bb5464ebc0a3f9b2 ]

This patch addresses what Dave Chinner had discovered and fixed within
commit: 7684e2c4384d. This changes does not have any user visible
impact for ext4 as none of the current users of ext4_iomap_begin()
that extend files depend on IOMAP_F_DIRTY.

When doing a direct IO that spans the current EOF, and there are
written blocks beyond EOF that extend beyond the current write, the
only metadata update that needs to be done is a file size extension.

However, we don't mark such iomaps as IOMAP_F_DIRTY to indicate that
there is IO completion metadata updates required, and hence we may
fail to correctly sync file size extensions made in IO completion when
O_DSYNC writes are being used and the hardware supports FUA.

Hence when setting IOMAP_F_DIRTY, we need to also take into account
whether the iomap spans the current EOF. If it does, then we need to
mark it dirty so that IO completion will call generic_write_sync() to
flush the inode size update to stable storage correctly.
