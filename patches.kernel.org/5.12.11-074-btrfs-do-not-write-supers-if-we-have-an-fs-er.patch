Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: do not write supers if we have an fs error
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.11
Git-commit: 165ea85f14831f27fc6fe3b02b35e42e50b9ed94

commit 165ea85f14831f27fc6fe3b02b35e42e50b9ed94 upstream.

Error injection testing uncovered a pretty severe problem where we could
end up committing a super that pointed to the wrong tree roots,
resulting in transid mismatch errors.

The way we commit the transaction is we update the super copy with the
current generations and bytenrs of the important roots, and then copy
that into our super_for_commit.  Then we allow transactions to continue
again, we write out the dirty pages for the transaction, and then we
write the super.  If the write out fails we'll bail and skip writing the
supers.

However since we've allowed a new transaction to start, we can have a
log attempting to sync at this point, which would be blocked on
fs_info->tree_log_mutex.  Once the commit fails we're allowed to do the
log tree commit, which uses super_for_commit, which now points at fs
tree's that were not written out.

Fix this by checking BTRFS_FS_STATE_ERROR once we acquire the
tree_log_mutex.  This way if the transaction commit fails we're sure to
see this bit set and we can skip writing the super out.  This patch
fixes this specific transid mismatch error I was seeing with this
particular error path.
