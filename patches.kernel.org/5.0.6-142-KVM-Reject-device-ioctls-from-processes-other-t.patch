Subject: [PATCH] KVM: Reject device ioctls from processes other than the VM's
 creator
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.6
Git-commit: ddba91801aeb5c160b660caed1800eb3aef403f8

commit ddba91801aeb5c160b660caed1800eb3aef403f8 upstream.

KVM's API requires thats ioctls must be issued from the same process
that created the VM.  In other words, userspace can play games with a
VM's file descriptors, e.g. fork(), SCM_RIGHTS, etc..., but only the
creator can do anything useful.  Explicitly reject device ioctls that
are issued by a process other than the VM's creator, and update KVM's
API documentation to extend its requirements to device ioctls.
