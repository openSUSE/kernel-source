Subject: [PATCH] exec: Fix incorrect type for ret
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.56
Git-commit: 5e088248375d171b80c643051e77ade6b97bc386

[ Upstream commit 5e088248375d171b80c643051e77ade6b97bc386 ]

In the setup_arg_pages(), ret is declared as an unsigned long.
The ret might take a negative value. Therefore, its type should
be changed to int.
