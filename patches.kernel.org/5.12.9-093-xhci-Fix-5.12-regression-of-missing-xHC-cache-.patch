Subject: [PATCH] xhci: Fix 5.12 regression of missing xHC cache clearing
 command after a Stall
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.9
Git-commit: a7f2e9272aff1ccfe0fc801dab1d5a7a1c6b7ed2

commit a7f2e9272aff1ccfe0fc801dab1d5a7a1c6b7ed2 upstream.

If endpoints halts due to a stall then the dequeue pointer read from
hardware may already be set ahead of the stalled TRB.
After commit 674f8438c121 ("xhci: split handling halted endpoints into two
steps") in 5.12 xhci driver won't issue a Set TR Dequeue if hardware
dequeue pointer is already in the right place.

Turns out the "Set TR Dequeue pointer" command is anyway needed as it in
addition to moving the dequeue pointer also clears endpoint state and
cache.

Fixes: 674f8438c121 ("xhci: split handling halted endpoints into two steps")
