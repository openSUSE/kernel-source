Subject: [PATCH] KVM: SVM: Don't intercept #GP for SEV guests
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.16.5
Git-commit: 0b0be065b7563ac708aaa9f69dd4941c80b3446d

commit 0b0be065b7563ac708aaa9f69dd4941c80b3446d upstream.

Never intercept #GP for SEV guests as reading SEV guest private memory
will return cyphertext, i.e. emulating on #GP can't work as intended.
