Subject: [PATCH] KVM: nVMX: Emulate guest TLB flush on nested VM-Enter with
 new vpid12
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.7
Git-commit: 712494de96f35f3e146b36b752c2afe0fdc0f0cc

commit 712494de96f35f3e146b36b752c2afe0fdc0f0cc upstream.

Fully emulate a guest TLB flush on nested VM-Enter which changes vpid12,
i.e. L2's VPID, instead of simply doing INVVPID to flush real hardware's
TLB entries for vpid02.  From L1's perspective, changing L2's VPID is
effectively a TLB flush unless "hardware" has previously cached entries
for the new vpid12.  Because KVM tracks only a single vpid12, KVM doesn't
know if the new vpid12 has been used in the past and so must treat it as
a brand new, never been used VPID, i.e. must assume that the new vpid12
represents a TLB flush from L1's perspective.

For example, if L1 and L2 share a CR3, the first VM-Enter to L2 (with a
VPID) is effectively a TLB flush as hardware/KVM has never seen vpid12
and thus can't have cached entries in the TLB for vpid12.
