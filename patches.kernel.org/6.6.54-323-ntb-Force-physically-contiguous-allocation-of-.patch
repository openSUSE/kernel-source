Subject: [PATCH] ntb: Force physically contiguous allocation of rx ring
 buffers
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.54
Git-commit: 061a785a114f159e990ea8ed8d1b7dca4b41120f

[ Upstream commit 061a785a114f159e990ea8ed8d1b7dca4b41120f ]

Physical addresses under IOVA on x86 platform are mapped contiguously
as a side effect before the patch that removed CONFIG_DMA_REMAP. The
NTB rx buffer ring is a single chunk DMA buffer that is allocated
against the NTB PCI device. If the receive side is using a DMA device,
then the buffers are remapped against the DMA device before being
submitted via the dmaengine API. This scheme becomes a problem when
the physical memory is discontiguous. When dma_map_page() is called
on the kernel virtual address from the dma_alloc_coherent() call, the
new IOVA mapping no longer points to all the physical memory allocated
due to being discontiguous. Change dma_alloc_coherent() to dma_alloc_attrs()
in order to force DMA_ATTR_FORCE_CONTIGUOUS attribute. This is the best
fix for the circumstance. A potential future solution may be having the DMA
mapping API providing a way to alias an existing IOVA mapping to a new
device perhaps.

This fix is not to fix the patch pointed to by the fixes tag, but to fix
the issue arised in the ntb_transport driver on x86 platforms after the
said patch is applied.
