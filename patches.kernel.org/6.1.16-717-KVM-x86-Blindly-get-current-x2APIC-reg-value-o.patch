Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: Blindly get current x2APIC reg value on "nodecode
 write" traps
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: 0a19807b464fb10aa79b9dd7f494bc317438fada

commit 0a19807b464fb10aa79b9dd7f494bc317438fada upstream.

When emulating a x2APIC write in response to an APICv/AVIC trap, get the
the written value from the vAPIC page without checking that reads are
allowed for the target register.  AVIC can generate trap-like VM-Exits on
writes to EOI, and so KVM needs to get the written value from the backing
page without running afoul of EOI's write-only behavior.

Alternatively, EOI could be special cased to always write '0', e.g. so
that the sanity check could be preserved, but x2APIC on AMD is actually
supposed to disallow non-zero writes (not emulated by KVM), and the
sanity check was a byproduct of how the KVM code was written, i.e. wasn't
added to guard against anything in particular.

Fixes: 70c8327c11c6 ("KVM: x86: Bug the VM if an accelerated x2APIC trap occurs on a "bad" reg")
Fixes: 1bd9dfec9fd4 ("KVM: x86: Do not block APIC write for non ICR registers")
