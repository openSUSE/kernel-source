Subject: [PATCH] MIPS: BMIPS: Do not mask IPIs during suspend
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.10
Git-commit: 06a3f0c9f2725f5d7c63c4203839373c9bd00c28

commit 06a3f0c9f2725f5d7c63c4203839373c9bd00c28 upstream.

Commit a3e6c1eff548 ("MIPS: IRQ: Fix disable_irq on CPU IRQs") fixes an
issue where disable_irq did not actually disable the irq. The bug caused
our IPIs to not be disabled, which actually is the correct behavior.

With the addition of commit a3e6c1eff548 ("MIPS: IRQ: Fix disable_irq on
CPU IRQs"), the IPIs were getting disabled going into suspend, thus
schedule_ipi() was not being called. This caused deadlocks where
schedulable task were not being scheduled and other cpus were waiting
for them to do something.

Add the IRQF_NO_SUSPEND flag so an irq_disable will not be called on the
IPIs during suspend.
