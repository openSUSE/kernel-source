Subject: [PATCH] scsi: ufs: core: Add a quirk to suppress link_startup_again
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.58
Git-commit: d34caa89a132cd69efc48361d4772251546fdb88

commit d34caa89a132cd69efc48361d4772251546fdb88 upstream.

ufshcd_link_startup() has a facility (link_startup_again) to issue
DME_LINKSTARTUP a 2nd time even though the 1st time was successful.

Some older hardware benefits from that, however the behaviour is
non-standard, and has been found to cause link startup to be unreliable
for some Intel Alder Lake based host controllers.

Add UFSHCD_QUIRK_PERFORM_LINK_STARTUP_ONCE to suppress
link_startup_again, in preparation for setting the quirk for affected
controllers.
