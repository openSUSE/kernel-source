Subject: [PATCH] ext4: fix online resizing for bigalloc file systems with a 1k
 block size
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.11
Git-commit: 5f8c10936fab2b69a487400f2872902e597dd320

commit 5f8c10936fab2b69a487400f2872902e597dd320 upstream.

An online resize of a file system with the bigalloc feature enabled
and a 1k block size would be refused since ext4_resize_begin() did not
understand s_first_data_block is 0 for all bigalloc file systems, even
when the block size is 1k.
