Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: flush write bio if we loop in extent_write_cache_pages
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.3
Git-commit: 42ffb0bf584ae5b6b38f72259af1e0ee417ac77f

commit 42ffb0bf584ae5b6b38f72259af1e0ee417ac77f upstream.

There exists a deadlock with range_cyclic that has existed forever.  If
we loop around with a bio already built we could deadlock with a writer
who has the page locked that we're attempting to write but is waiting on
a page in our bio to be written out.  The task traces are as follows

I used drgn to find the respective pages we were stuck on

page_entry.page 0xffffea00fbfc7500 index 8148 bit 15 pid 2167901
page_entry.page 0xffffea00f9bb7400 index 7680 bit 0 pid 1329874

As you can see the kworker is waiting for bit 0 (PG_locked) on index
7680, and aio-dio-invalid is waiting for bit 15 (PG_writeback) on index
8148.  aio-dio-invalid has 7680, and the kworker epd looks like the
following

  crash> struct extent_page_data ffffc900297bbbb0
  struct extent_page_data {
    bio = 0xffff889f747ed830,
    tree = 0xffff889eed6ba448,
    extent_locked = 0,
    sync_io = 0
  }

Probably worth mentioning as well that it waits for writeback of the
page to complete while holding a lock on it (at prepare_pages()).

Using drgn I walked the bio pages looking for page
0xffffea00fbfc7500 which is the one we're waiting for writeback on

  bio = Object(prog, 'struct bio', address=0xffff889f747ed830)
  for i in range(0, bio.bi_vcnt.value_()):
      bv = bio.bi_io_vec[i]
      if bv.bv_page.value_() == 0xffffea00fbfc7500:
	  print("FOUND IT")

which validated what I suspected.

The fix for this is simple, flush the epd before we loop back around to
the beginning of the file during writeout.
