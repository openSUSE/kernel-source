Subject: [PATCH] Revert "net: liquidio: fix a NULL pointer dereference"
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.9
Git-commit: 4fd798a5a89114c1892574c50f2aebd49bc5b4f5

[ Upstream commit 4fd798a5a89114c1892574c50f2aebd49bc5b4f5 ]

This reverts commit fe543b2f174f34a7a751aa08b334fe6b105c4569.

Because of recent interactions with developers from @umn.edu, all
commits from them have been recently re-reviewed to ensure if they were
correct or not.

Upon review, this commit was found to be incorrect for the reasons
below, so it must be reverted.  It will be fixed up "correctly" in a
later kernel change.

While the original commit does keep the immediate "NULL dereference"
from happening, it does not properly propagate the error back to the
callers, AND it does not fix this same identical issue in the
drivers/net/ethernet/cavium/liquidio/lio_vf_main.c for some reason.
