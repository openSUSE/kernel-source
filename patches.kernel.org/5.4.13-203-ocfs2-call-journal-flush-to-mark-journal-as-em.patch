Subject: [PATCH] ocfs2: call journal flush to mark journal as empty after
 journal recovery when mount
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.13
Git-commit: 397eac17f86f404f5ba31d8c3e39ec3124b39fd3

[ Upstream commit 397eac17f86f404f5ba31d8c3e39ec3124b39fd3 ]

If journal is dirty when mount, it will be replayed but jbd2 sb log tail
cannot be updated to mark a new start because journal->j_flag has
already been set with JBD2_ABORT first in journal_init_common.

When a new transaction is committed, it will be recored in block 1
first(journal->j_tail is set to 1 in journal_reset).  If emergency
restart happens again before journal super block is updated
unfortunately, the new recorded trans will not be replayed in the next
mount.

The following steps describe this procedure in detail.
1. mount and touch some files
2. these transactions are committed to journal area but not checkpointed
3. emergency restart
4. mount again and its journals are replayed
5. journal super block's first s_start is 1, but its s_seq is not updated
6. touch a new file and its trans is committed but not checkpointed
7. emergency restart again
8. mount and journal is dirty, but trans committed in 6 will not be
replayed.

This exception happens easily when this lun is used by only one node.
If it is used by multi-nodes, other node will replay its journal and its
journal super block will be updated after recovery like what this patch
does.

ocfs2_recover_node->ocfs2_replay_journal.

The following jbd2 journal can be generated by touching a new file after
journal is replayed, and seq 15 is the first valid commit, but first seq
is 13 in journal super block.

  Block 9: Journal Commit Block
  Seq: 15   Type: 2 (JBD2_COMMIT_BLOCK)

The following is journal recovery log when recovering the upper jbd2
journal when mount again.

syslog:
  ocfs2: File system on device (252,1) was not unmounted cleanly, recovering it.
  fs/jbd2/recovery.c:(do_one_pass, 449): Starting recovery pass 0
  fs/jbd2/recovery.c:(do_one_pass, 449): Starting recovery pass 1
  fs/jbd2/recovery.c:(do_one_pass, 449): Starting recovery pass 2
  fs/jbd2/recovery.c:(jbd2_journal_recover, 278): JBD2: recovery, exit status 0, recovered transactions 13 to 13

Due to first commit seq 13 recorded in journal super is not consistent
with the value recorded in block 1(seq is 14), journal recovery will be
terminated before seq 15 even though it is an unbroken commit, inode
8257802 is a new file and it will be lost.
