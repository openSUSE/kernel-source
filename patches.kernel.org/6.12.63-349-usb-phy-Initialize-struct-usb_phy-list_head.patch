Subject: [PATCH] usb: phy: Initialize struct usb_phy list_head
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.63
Git-commit: c69ff68b097b0f53333114f1b2c3dc128f389596

commit c69ff68b097b0f53333114f1b2c3dc128f389596 upstream.

As part of the registration of a new 'struct usb_phy' with the USB PHY core
via either usb_add_phy(struct usb_phy *x, ...) or usb_add_phy_dev(struct
usb_phy *x) these functions call list_add_tail(&x->head, phy_list) in
order for the new instance x to be stored in phy_list, a static list
kept internally by the core.

After 7d21114dc6a2 ("usb: phy: Introduce one extcon device into usb phy")
when executing either of the registration functions above it is possible
that usb_add_extcon() fails, leading to either function returning before
the call to list_add_tail(), leaving x->head uninitialized.

Then, when a driver tries to undo the failed registration by calling
usb_remove_phy(struct usb_phy *x) there will be an unconditional call to
list_del(&x->head) acting on an uninitialized variable, and thus a
possible NULL pointer dereference.

Fix this by initializing x->head before usb_add_extcon() has a
chance to fail. Note that this was not needed before 7d21114dc6a2 since
list_add_phy() was executed unconditionally and it guaranteed that x->head
was initialized.
