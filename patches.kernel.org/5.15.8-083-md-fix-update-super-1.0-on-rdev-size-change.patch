Subject: [PATCH] md: fix update super 1.0 on rdev size change
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.8
Git-commit: 55df1ce0d4e086e05a8ab20619c73c729350f965

commit 55df1ce0d4e086e05a8ab20619c73c729350f965 upstream.

The superblock of version 1.0 doesn't get moved to the new position on a
device size change. This leads to a rdev without a superblock on a known
position, the raid can't be re-assembled.

The line was removed by mistake and is re-added by this patch.
