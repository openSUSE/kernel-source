Subject: [PATCH] rxrpc: Fix race between incoming ACK parser and retransmitter
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.8
Git-commit: 2ad6691d988c0c611362ddc2aad89e0fb50e3261

[ Upstream commit 2ad6691d988c0c611362ddc2aad89e0fb50e3261 ]

There's a race between the retransmission code and the received ACK parser.
The problem is that the retransmission loop has to drop the lock under
which it is iterating through the transmission buffer in order to transmit
a packet, but whilst the lock is dropped, the ACK parser can crank the Tx
window round and discard the packets from the buffer.

The retransmission code then updated the annotations for the wrong packet
and a later retransmission thought it had to retransmit a packet that
wasn't there, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

Fix this by:

 (1) Moving the annotation change to before we drop the lock prior to
     transmission.  This means we can't vary the annotation depending on
     the outcome of the transmission, but that's fine - we'll retransmit
     again later if it failed now.

 (2) Skipping the packet if the skb pointer is NULL.

The following oops was seen:

	BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 000000000000002d
	Workqueue: krxrpcd rxrpc_process_call
	RIP: 0010:rxrpc_get_skb+0x14/0x8a
	...
	Call Trace:
	 rxrpc_resend+0x331/0x41e
