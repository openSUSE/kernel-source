Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: fix RockPro64 vdd-log regulator
 settings
References: bnc#1151927
Patch-mainline: 5.3.10
Git-commit: 0990c5e7573098117c69651821647c228483e31b

[ Upstream commit 0990c5e7573098117c69651821647c228483e31b ]

The RockPro64 schematic [1] page 18 states a min voltage of 0.8V and a
max voltage of 1.4V for the VDD_LOG pwm regulator. However, there is an
additional note that the pwm parameter needs to be modified.
From the schematics a voltage range of 0.8V to 1.7V can be calculated.
Additional voltage measurements on the board show that this fix indeed
leads to the correct voltage, while without this fix the voltage was set
too high.
