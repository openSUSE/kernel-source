Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: bus: Ensure that notify handlers are not running after
 removal
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.28
Git-commit: faae443738c6f0dac9b0d3d11d108f6911a989a9

[ Upstream commit faae443738c6f0dac9b0d3d11d108f6911a989a9 ]

Currently, acpi_device_remove_notify_handler() may return while the
notify handler being removed is still running which may allow the
module holding that handler to be torn down prematurely.

Address this issue by making acpi_device_remove_notify_handler() wait
for the handling of all the ACPI events in progress to complete before
returning.
