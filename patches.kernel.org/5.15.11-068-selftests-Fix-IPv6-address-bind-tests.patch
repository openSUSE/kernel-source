Subject: [PATCH] selftests: Fix IPv6 address bind tests
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.11
Git-commit: 28a2686c185e84b6aa6a4d9c9a972360eb7ca266

[ Upstream commit 28a2686c185e84b6aa6a4d9c9a972360eb7ca266 ]

IPv6 allows binding a socket to a device then binding to an address
not on the device (__inet6_bind -> ipv6_chk_addr with strict flag
not set). Update the bind tests to reflect legacy behavior.

Fixes: 34d0302ab861 ("selftests: Add ipv6 address bind tests to fcnal-test")
