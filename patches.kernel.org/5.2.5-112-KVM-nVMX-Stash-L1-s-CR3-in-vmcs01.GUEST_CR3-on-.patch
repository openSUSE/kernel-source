Subject: [PATCH] KVM: nVMX: Stash L1's CR3 in vmcs01.GUEST_CR3 on nested entry
 w/o EPT
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.5

[ Upstream commit f087a02941feacf7d6f097522bc67c602fda18e6 ]

KVM does not have 100% coverage of VMX consistency checks, i.e. some
checks that cause VM-Fail may only be detected by hardware during a
nested VM-Entry.  In such a case, KVM must restore L1's state to the
pre-VM-Enter state as L2's state has already been loaded into KVM's
software model.

L1's CR3 and PDPTRs in particular are loaded from vmcs01.GUEST_*.  But
when EPT is disabled, the associated fields hold KVM's shadow values,
not L1's "real" values.  Fortunately, when EPT is disabled the PDPTRs
come from memory, i.e. are not cached in the VMCS.  Which leaves CR3
as the sole anomaly.

A previously applied workaround to handle CR3 was to force nested early
checks if EPT is disabled:

  commit 2b27924bb1d48 ("KVM: nVMX: always use early vmcs check when EPT
                         is disabled")

Forcing nested early checks is undesirable as doing so adds hundreds of
cycles to every nested VM-Entry.  Rather than take this performance hit,
handle CR3 by overwriting vmcs01.GUEST_CR3 with L1's CR3 during nested
VM-Entry when EPT is disabled *and* nested early checks are disabled.
By stuffing vmcs01.GUEST_CR3, nested_vmx_restore_host_state() will
naturally restore the correct vcpu->arch.cr3 from vmcs01.GUEST_CR3.

These shenanigans work because nested_vmx_restore_host_state() does a
full kvm_mmu_reset_context(), i.e. unloads the current MMU, which
guarantees vmcs01.GUEST_CR3 will be rewritten with a new shadow CR3
prior to re-entering L1.

vcpu->arch.root_mmu.root_hpa is set to INVALID_PAGE via:

    nested_vmx_restore_host_state() ->
        kvm_mmu_reset_context() ->
            kvm_mmu_unload() ->
                kvm_mmu_free_roots()

kvm_mmu_unload() has WARN_ON(root_hpa != INVALID_PAGE), i.e. we can bank
on 'root_hpa == INVALID_PAGE' unless the implementation of
kvm_mmu_reset_context() is changed.

On the way into L1, VMCS.GUEST_CR3 is guaranteed to be written (on a
successful entry) via:

    vcpu_enter_guest() ->
        kvm_mmu_reload() ->
            kvm_mmu_load() ->
                kvm_mmu_load_cr3() ->
                    vmx_set_cr3()

Stuff vmcs01.GUEST_CR3 if and only if nested early checks are disabled
as a "late" VM-Fail should never happen win that case (KVM WARNs), and
the conditional write avoids the need to restore the correct GUEST_CR3
when nested_vmx_check_vmentry_hw() fails.
