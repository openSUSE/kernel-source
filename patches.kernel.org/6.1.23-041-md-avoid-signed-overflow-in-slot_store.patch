Subject: [PATCH] md: avoid signed overflow in slot_store()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.23

[ Upstream commit 3bc57292278a0b6ac4656cad94c14f2453344b57 ]

slot_store() uses kstrtouint() to get a slot number, but stores the
result in an "int" variable (by casting a pointer).
This can result in a negative slot number if the unsigned int value is
very large.

A negative number means that the slot is empty, but setting a negative
slot number this way will not remove the device from the array.  I don't
think this is a serious problem, but it could cause confusion and it is
best to fix it.
