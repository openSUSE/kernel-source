Subject: [PATCH] HID: wacom: Always increment hdev refcount within
 wacom_get_hdev_data
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.13.6
Git-commit: 2a5e597c6bb1b873e473e5f57147e9e5d2755430

commit 2a5e597c6bb1b873e473e5f57147e9e5d2755430 upstream.

The wacom_get_hdev_data function is used to find and return a reference to
the "other half" of a Wacom device (i.e., the touch device associated with
a pen, or vice-versa). To ensure these references are properly accounted
for, the function is supposed to automatically increment the refcount before
returning. This was not done, however, for devices which have pen & touch
on different interfaces of the same USB device. This can lead to a WARNING
("refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free") when removing the module or device
as we call kref_put() more times than kref_get(). Triggering an "actual" use-
after-free would be difficult since both devices will disappear nearly-
simultaneously. To silence this warning and prevent the potential error, we
need to increment the refcount for all cases within wacom_get_hdev_data.
