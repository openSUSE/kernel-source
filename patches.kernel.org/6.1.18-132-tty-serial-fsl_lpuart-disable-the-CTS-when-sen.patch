Subject: [PATCH] tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: disable the CTS when send break
 signal
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.18
Git-commit: c4c81db5cf8bc53d6160c3abf26d382c841aa434

[ Upstream commit c4c81db5cf8bc53d6160c3abf26d382c841aa434 ]

LPUART IP has a bug that it treats the CTS as higher priority than the
break signal, which cause the break signal sending through UARTCTRL_SBK
may impacted by the CTS input if the HW flow control is enabled.

Add this workaround patch to fix the IP bug, we can disable CTS before
asserting SBK to avoid any interference from CTS, and re-enable it when
break off.

Such as for the bluetooth chip power save feature, host can let the BT
chip get into sleep state by sending a UART break signal, and wake it up
by turning off the UART break. If the BT chip enters the sleep mode
successfully, it will pull up the CTS line, if the BT chip is woken up,
it will pull down the CTS line. If without this workaround patch, the
UART TX pin cannot send the break signal successfully as it affected by
the BT CTS pin. After adding this patch, the BT power save feature can
work well.
