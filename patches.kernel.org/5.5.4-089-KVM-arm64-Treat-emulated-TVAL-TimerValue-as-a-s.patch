Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm64: Treat emulated TVAL TimerValue as a signed 32-bit
 integer
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.4
Git-commit: 4a267aa707953a9a73d1f5dc7f894dd9024a92be

commit 4a267aa707953a9a73d1f5dc7f894dd9024a92be upstream.

According to the ARM ARM, registers CNT{P,V}_TVAL_EL0 have bits [63:32]
RES0 [1]. When reading the register, the value is truncated to the least
significant 32 bits [2], and on writes, TimerValue is treated as a signed
32-bit integer [1, 2].

When the guest behaves correctly and writes 32-bit values, treating TVAL
as an unsigned 64 bit register works as expected. However, things start
to break down when the guest writes larger values, because
(u64)0x1_ffff_ffff = 8589934591. but (s32)0x1_ffff_ffff = -1, and the
former will cause the timer interrupt to be asserted in the future, but
the latter will cause it to be asserted now.  Let's treat TVAL as a
signed 32-bit register on writes, to match the behaviour described in
the architecture, and the behaviour experimentally exhibited by the
virtual timer on a non-vhe host.
