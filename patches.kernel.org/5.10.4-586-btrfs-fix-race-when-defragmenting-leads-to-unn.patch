Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: fix race when defragmenting leads to unnecessary IO
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.4
Git-commit: 7f458a3873ae94efe1f37c8b96c97e7298769e98

commit 7f458a3873ae94efe1f37c8b96c97e7298769e98 upstream.

When defragmenting we skip ranges that have holes or inline extents, so that
we don't do unnecessary IO and waste space. We do this check when calling
should_defrag_range() at btrfs_defrag_file(). However we do it without
holding the inode's lock. The reason we do it like this is to avoid
blocking other tasks for too long, that possibly want to operate on other
file ranges, since after the call to should_defrag_range() and before
locking the inode, we trigger a synchronous page cache readahead. However
before we were able to lock the inode, some other task might have punched
a hole in our range, or we may now have an inline extent there, in which
case we should not set the range for defrag anymore since that would cause
unnecessary IO and make us waste space (i.e. allocating extents to contain
zeros for a hole).

So after we locked the inode and the range in the iotree, check again if
we have holes or an inline extent, and if we do, just skip the range.

I hit this while testing my next patch that fixes races when updating an
inode's number of bytes (subject "btrfs: update the number of bytes used
by an inode atomically"), and it depends on this change in order to work
correctly. Alternatively I could rework that other patch to detect holes
and flag their range with the 'new delalloc' bit, but this itself fixes
an efficiency problem due a race that from a functional point of view is
not harmful (it could be triggered with btrfs/062 from fstests).
