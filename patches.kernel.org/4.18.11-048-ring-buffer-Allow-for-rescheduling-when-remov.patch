Subject: [PATCH] ring-buffer: Allow for rescheduling when removing pages
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.11
Git-commit: 83f365554e47997ec68dc4eca3f5dce525cd15c3

commit 83f365554e47997ec68dc4eca3f5dce525cd15c3 upstream.

When reducing ring buffer size, pages are removed by scheduling a work
item on each CPU for the corresponding CPU ring buffer. After the pages
are removed from ring buffer linked list, the pages are free()d in a
tight loop. The loop does not give up CPU until all pages are removed.
In a worst case behavior, when lot of pages are to be freed, it can
cause system stall.

After the pages are removed from the list, the free() can happen while
the work is rescheduled. Call cond_resched() in the loop to prevent the
system hangup.
