Subject: [PATCH] tools/memory-model: Fix data race detection for unordered
 store and load

[ Upstream commit daebf24a8e8c6064cba3a330db9fe9376a137d2c ]

Currently the Linux Kernel Memory Model gives an incorrect response
for the following litmus test:

C plain-WWC

{}

P0(int *x)
{
	WRITE_ONCE(*x, 2);
}

P1(int *x, int *y)
{
	int r1;
	int r2;
	int r3;

	r1 = READ_ONCE(*x);
	if (r1 == 2) {
		smp_rmb();
		r2 = *x;
	}
	smp_rmb();
	r3 = READ_ONCE(*x);
	WRITE_ONCE(*y, r3 - 1);
}

P2(int *x, int *y)
{
	int r4;

	r4 = READ_ONCE(*y);
	if (r4 > 0)
		WRITE_ONCE(*x, 1);
}

exists (x=2 /\ 1:r2=2 /\ 2:r4=1)

The memory model says that the plain read of *x in P1 races with the
WRITE_ONCE(*x) in P2.

The problem is that we have a write W and a read R related by neither
fre or rfe, but rather W ->coe W' ->rfe R, where W' is an intermediate
write (the WRITE_ONCE() in P0).  In this situation there is no
particular ordering between W and R, so either a wr-vis link from W to
R or an rw-xbstar link from R to W would prove that the accesses
aren't concurrent.

But the LKMM only looks for a wr-vis link, which is equivalent to
assuming that W must execute before R.  This is not necessarily true
on non-multicopy-atomic systems, as the WWC pattern demonstrates.

This patch changes the LKMM to accept either a wr-vis or a reverse
rw-xbstar link as a proof of non-concurrency.
