Subject: [PATCH] cachefiles: Fix an assertion failure when trying to update a
 failed object
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.10
Git-commit: e6bc06faf64a83384cc0abc537df954c9d3ff942

[ Upstream commit e6bc06faf64a83384cc0abc537df954c9d3ff942 ]

If cachefiles gets an error other then ENOENT when trying to look up an
object in the cache (in this case, EACCES), the object state machine will
eventually transition to the DROP_OBJECT state.

This state invokes fscache_drop_object() which tries to sync the auxiliary
data with the cache (this is done lazily since commit 402cb8dda949d) on an
incomplete cache object struct.

The problem comes when cachefiles_update_object_xattr() is called to
rewrite the xattr holding the data.  There's an assertion there that the
cache object points to a dentry as we're going to update its xattr.  The
assertion trips, however, as dentry didn't get set.

Fix the problem by skipping the update in cachefiles if the object doesn't
refer to a dentry.  A better way to do it could be to skip the update from
the DROP_OBJECT state handler in fscache, but that might deny the cache the
opportunity to update intermediate state.

If this error occurs, the kernel log includes lines that look like the
following:

 CacheFiles: Lookup failed error -13
 CacheFiles:
 CacheFiles: Assertion failed

Note that there are actually two issues here: (1) EACCES happened on a
cache object and (2) an oops occurred.  I think that the second is a
consequence of the first (it certainly looks like it ought to be).  This
patch only deals with the second.
