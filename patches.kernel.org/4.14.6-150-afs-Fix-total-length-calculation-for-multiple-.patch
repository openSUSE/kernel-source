Subject: [PATCH] afs: Fix total-length calculation for multiple-page send
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.6
Git-commit: 1199db603511d7463d9d3840f96f61967affc766

[ Upstream commit 1199db603511d7463d9d3840f96f61967affc766 ]

Fix the total-length calculation in afs_make_call() when the operation
being dispatched has data from a series of pages attached.

Despite the patched code looking like that it should reduce mathematically
to the current code, it doesn't because the 32-bit unsigned arithmetic
being used to calculate the page-offset-difference doesn't correctly extend
to a 64-bit value when the result is effectively negative.

Without this, some FS.StoreData operations that span multiple pages fail,
reporting too little or too much data.
