Subject: [PATCH] char: misc: Make misc_register() reentry for miscdevice who
 wants dynamic minor
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.8
Git-commit: 52e2bb5ff089d65e2c7d982fe2826dc88e473d50

[ Upstream commit 52e2bb5ff089d65e2c7d982fe2826dc88e473d50 ]

For miscdevice who wants dynamic minor, it may fail to be registered again
without reinitialization after being de-registered, which is illustrated
by kunit test case miscdev_test_dynamic_reentry() newly added.

There is a real case found by cascardo when a part of minor range were
contained by range [0, 255):

1) wmi/dell-smbios registered minor 122, and acpi_thermal_rel registered
   minor 123
2) unbind "int3400 thermal" driver from its device, this will de-register
   acpi_thermal_rel
3) rmmod then insmod dell_smbios again, now wmi/dell-smbios is using minor
   123
4) bind the device to "int3400 thermal" driver again, acpi_thermal_rel
   fails to register.

Some drivers may reuse the miscdevice structure after they are deregistered
If the intention is to allocate a dynamic minor, if the minor number is not
reset to MISC_DYNAMIC_MINOR before calling misc_register(), it will try to
register a previously dynamically allocated minor number, which may have
been registered by a different driver.

One such case is the acpi_thermal_rel misc device, registered by the
int3400 thermal driver. If the device is unbound from the driver and later
bound, if there was another dynamic misc device registered in between, it
would fail to register the acpi_thermal_rel misc device. Other drivers
behave similarly.

Actually, this kind of issue is prone to happen if APIs
misc_register()/misc_deregister() are invoked by driver's
probe()/remove() separately.

Instead of fixing all the drivers, just reset the minor member to
MISC_DYNAMIC_MINOR in misc_deregister() in case it was a dynamically
allocated minor number, as error handling of misc_register() does.
