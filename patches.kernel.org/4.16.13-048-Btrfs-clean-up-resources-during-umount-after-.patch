Subject: [PATCH] Btrfs: clean up resources during umount after trans is
 aborted
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.13
Git-commit: af7227338135d2f1b1552bf9a6d43e02dcba10b9

[ Upstream commit af7227338135d2f1b1552bf9a6d43e02dcba10b9 ]

Currently if some fatal errors occur, like all IO get -EIO, resources
would be cleaned up when
a) transaction is being committed or
b) BTRFS_FS_STATE_ERROR is set

However, in some rare cases, resources may be left alone after transaction
gets aborted and umount may run into some ASSERT(), e.g.
ASSERT(list_empty(&block_group->dirty_list));

For case a), in btrfs_commit_transaciton(), there're several places at the
beginning where we just call btrfs_end_transaction() without cleaning up
resources.  For case b), it is possible that the trans handle doesn't have
any dirty stuff, then only trans hanlde is marked as aborted while
BTRFS_FS_STATE_ERROR is not set, so resources remain in memory.

This makes btrfs also check BTRFS_FS_STATE_TRANS_ABORTED to make sure that
all resources won't stay in memory after umount.
