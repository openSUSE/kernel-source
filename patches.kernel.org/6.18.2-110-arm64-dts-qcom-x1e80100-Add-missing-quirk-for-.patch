Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: x1e80100: Add missing quirk for HS only USB
 controller
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.2
Git-commit: 6b3e8a5d6c88609d9ce93789524f818cca0aa485

[ Upstream commit 6b3e8a5d6c88609d9ce93789524f818cca0aa485 ]

The PIPE clock is provided by the USB3 PHY, which is predictably not
connected to the HS-only controller. Add "qcom,select-utmi-as-pipe-clk"
quirk to  HS only USB controller to disable pipe clock requirement.
