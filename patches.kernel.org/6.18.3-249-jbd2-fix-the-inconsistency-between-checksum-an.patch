Subject: [PATCH] jbd2: fix the inconsistency between checksum and data in
 memory for journal sb
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.3
Git-commit: 6abfe107894af7e8ce3a2e120c619d81ee764ad5

commit 6abfe107894af7e8ce3a2e120c619d81ee764ad5 upstream.

Copying the file system while it is mounted as read-only results in
a mount failure:
[~]# mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/sdc
[~]# mount /dev/sdc -o ro /mnt/test
[~]# dd if=/dev/sdc of=/dev/sda bs=1M
[~]# mount /dev/sda /mnt/test1
[ 1094.849826] JBD2: journal checksum error
[ 1094.850927] EXT4-fs (sda): Could not load journal inode
mount: mount /dev/sda on /mnt/test1 failed: Bad message

The process described above is just an abstracted way I came up with to
reproduce the issue. In the actual scenario, the file system was mounted
read-only and then copied while it was still mounted. It was found that
the mount operation failed. The user intended to verify the data or use
it as a backup, and this action was performed during a version upgrade.
Above issue may happen as follows:
ext4_fill_super
 set_journal_csum_feature_set(sb)
  if (ext4_has_metadata_csum(sb))
   incompat = JBD2_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_CSUM_V3;
  if (test_opt(sb, JOURNAL_CHECKSUM)
   jbd2_journal_set_features(sbi->s_journal, compat, 0, incompat);
    lock_buffer(journal->j_sb_buffer);
    sb->s_feature_incompat  |= cpu_to_be32(incompat);
    //The data in the journal sb was modified, but the checksum was not
      updated, so the data remaining in memory has a mismatch between the
      data and the checksum.
    unlock_buffer(journal->j_sb_buffer);

In this case, the journal sb copied over is in a state where the checksum
and data are inconsistent, so mounting fails.
To solve the above issue, update the checksum in memory after modifying
the journal sb.
