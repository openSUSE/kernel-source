[ Upstream commit 9d3aaceb73acadf134596a2f8db9c451c1332d3d ]

Some Freescale 8250 implementations have the problem that a single long
break results in one irq per character frame time. The code in
fsl8250_handle_irq() that is supposed to handle that uses the BI bit in
lsr_saved_flags to detect such a situation and then skip the second
received character. However it also stores other error bits and so after
a single frame error the character received in the next irq handling is
passed to the upper layer with a frame error, too.

So after a spike on the data line (which is correctly recognized as a
frame error) the following valid character is thrown away, because the
driver reports a frame error for that one, too.

To weaken this problem restrict saving LSR to only the BI bit.

Note however that the handling is still broken:

 - lsr_saved_flags is updated using orig_lsr which is the LSR content
   for the first received char, but there might be more in the FIFO, so
   a character is thrown away that is received later and not necessarily
   the one following the break.
 - The doubled break might be the 2nd and 3rd char in the FIFO, so the
   workaround doesn't catch these, because serial8250_rx_chars() doesn't
   handle the workaround.
 - lsr_saved_flags might have set UART_LSR_BI at the entry of
   fsl8250_handle_irq() which doesn't originate from
   fsl8250_handle_irq()'s "up->lsr_saved_flags |= orig_lsr &
   UART_LSR_BI;" but from e.g. from serial8250_tx_empty().
 - For a long or a short break this isn't about two characters, but more
   or only a single one.
