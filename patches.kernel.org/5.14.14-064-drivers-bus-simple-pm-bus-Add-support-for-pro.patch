Subject: [PATCH] drivers: bus: simple-pm-bus: Add support for probing simple
 bus only devices
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.14
Git-commit: 98e96cf80045a383fcc47c58dd4e87b3ae587b3e

commit 98e96cf80045a383fcc47c58dd4e87b3ae587b3e upstream.

fw_devlink could end up creating device links for bus only devices.
However, bus only devices don't get probed and can block probe() or
sync_state() [1] call backs of other devices. To avoid this, probe these
devices using the simple-pm-bus driver.

However, there are instances of devices that are not simple buses (they get
probed by their specific drivers) that also list the "simple-bus" (or other
bus only compatible strings) in their compatible property to automatically
populate their child devices. We still want these devices to get probed by
their specific drivers. So, we make sure this driver only probes devices
that are only buses.
