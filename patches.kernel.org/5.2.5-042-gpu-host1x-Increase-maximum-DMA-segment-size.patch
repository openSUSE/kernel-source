Subject: [PATCH] gpu: host1x: Increase maximum DMA segment size
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.5
Git-commit: 1e390478cfb527e34c9ab89ba57212cb05c33c51

[ Upstream commit 1e390478cfb527e34c9ab89ba57212cb05c33c51 ]

Recent versions of the DMA API debug code have started to warn about
violations of the maximum DMA segment size. This is because the segment
size defaults to 64 KiB, which can easily be exceeded in large buffer
allocations such as used in DRM/KMS for framebuffers.

Technically the Tegra SMMU and ARM SMMU don't have a maximum segment
size (they map individual pages irrespective of whether they are
contiguous or not), so the choice of 4 MiB is a bit arbitrary here. The
maximum segment size is a 32-bit unsigned integer, though, so we can't
set it to the correct maximum size, which would be the size of the
aperture.
