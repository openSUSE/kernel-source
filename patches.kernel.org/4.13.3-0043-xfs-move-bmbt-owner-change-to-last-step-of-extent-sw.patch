Subject: [PATCH] xfs: move bmbt owner change to last step of extent swap
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.13.3
Git-commit: 6fb10d6d22094bc4062f92b9ccbcee2f54033d04

commit 6fb10d6d22094bc4062f92b9ccbcee2f54033d04 upstream.

The extent swap operation currently resets bmbt block owners before
the inode forks are swapped. The bmbt buffers are marked as ordered
so they do not have to be physically logged in the transaction.

This use of ordered buffers is not safe as bmbt buffers may have
been previously physically logged. The bmbt owner change algorithm
needs to be updated to physically log buffers that are already dirty
when/if they are encountered. This means that an extent swap will
eventually require multiple rolling transactions to handle large
btrees. In addition, all inode related changes must be logged before
the bmbt owner change scan begins and can roll the transaction for
the first time to preserve fs consistency via log recovery.

In preparation for such fixes to the bmbt owner change algorithm,
refactor the bmbt scan out of the extent fork swap code to the last
operation before the transaction is committed. Update
xfs_swap_extent_forks() to only set the inode log flags when an
owner change scan is necessary. Update xfs_swap_extents() to trigger
the owner change based on the inode log flags. Note that since the
owner change now occurs after the extent fork swap, the inode btrees
must be fixed up with the inode number of the current inode (similar
to log recovery).
