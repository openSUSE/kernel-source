Subject: [PATCH] neighbor: Call __ipv4_neigh_lookup_noref in neigh_xmit
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.9
Git-commit: 4b2a2bfeb3f056461a90bd621e8bd7d03fa47f60

[ Upstream commit 4b2a2bfeb3f056461a90bd621e8bd7d03fa47f60 ]

Commit cd9ff4de0107 changed the key for IFF_POINTOPOINT devices to
INADDR_ANY but neigh_xmit which is used for MPLS encapsulations was not
updated to use the altered key. The result is that every packet Tx does
a lookup on the gateway address which does not find an entry, a new one
is created only to find the existing one in the table right before the
insert since arp_constructor was updated to reset the primary key. This
is seen in the allocs and destroys counters:
    ip -s -4 ntable show | head -10 | grep alloc

which increase for each packet showing the unnecessary overhread.

Fix by having neigh_xmit use __ipv4_neigh_lookup_noref for NEIGH_ARP_TABLE.

Fixes: cd9ff4de0107 ("ipv4: Make neigh lookup keys for loopback/point-to-point devices be INADDR_ANY")
