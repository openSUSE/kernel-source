Subject: [PATCH] dmaengine: mmp_tdma: Reset channel error on release
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.14
Git-commit: 0c89446379218698189a47871336cb30286a7197

[ Upstream commit 0c89446379218698189a47871336cb30286a7197 ]

When a channel configuration fails, the status of the channel is set to
DEV_ERROR so that an attempt to submit it fails. However, this status
sticks until the heat end of the universe, making it impossible to
recover from the error.

Let's reset it when the channel is released so that further use of the
channel with correct configuration is not impacted.
