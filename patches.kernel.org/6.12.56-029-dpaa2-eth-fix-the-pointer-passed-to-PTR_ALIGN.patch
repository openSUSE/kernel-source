Subject: [PATCH] dpaa2-eth: fix the pointer passed to PTR_ALIGN on Tx path
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.56
Git-commit: 902e81e679d86846a2404630d349709ad9372d0d

[ Upstream commit 902e81e679d86846a2404630d349709ad9372d0d ]

The blamed commit increased the needed headroom to account for
alignment. This means that the size required to always align a Tx buffer
was added inside the dpaa2_eth_needed_headroom() function. By doing
that, a manual adjustment of the pointer passed to PTR_ALIGN() was no
longer correct since the 'buffer_start' variable was already pointing
to the start of the skb's memory.

The behavior of the dpaa2-eth driver without this patch was to drop
frames on Tx even when the headroom was matching the 128 bytes
necessary. Fix this by removing the manual adjust of 'buffer_start' from
the PTR_MODE call.
