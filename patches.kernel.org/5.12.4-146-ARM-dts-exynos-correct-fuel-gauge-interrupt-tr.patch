Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: exynos: correct fuel gauge interrupt trigger level
 on Midas family
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.4
Git-commit: 8a45f33bd36efbb624198cfa9fdf1f66fd1c3d26

[ Upstream commit 8a45f33bd36efbb624198cfa9fdf1f66fd1c3d26 ]

The Maxim fuel gauge datasheets describe the interrupt line as active
low with a requirement of acknowledge from the CPU.  The falling edge
interrupt will mostly work but it's not correct.
