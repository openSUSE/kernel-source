Subject: [PATCH] mm: memcontrol: fix swap undercounting in cgroup2
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.3
Git-commit: cae3af62b33aa931427a0f211e04347b22180b36

commit cae3af62b33aa931427a0f211e04347b22180b36 upstream.

When pages are swapped in, the VM may retain the swap copy to avoid
repeated writes in the future.  It's also retained if shared pages are
faulted back in some processes, but not in others.  During that time we
have an in-memory copy of the page, as well as an on-swap copy.  Cgroup1
and cgroup2 handle these overlapping lifetimes slightly differently due to
the nature of how they account memory and swap:

Cgroup1 has a unified memory+swap counter that tracks a data page
regardless whether it's in-core or swapped out.  On swapin, we transfer
the charge from the swap entry to the newly allocated swapcache page, even
though the swap entry might stick around for a while.  That's why we have
a mem_cgroup_uncharge_swap() call inside mem_cgroup_charge().

Cgroup2 tracks memory and swap as separate, independent resources and thus
has split memory and swap counters.  On swapin, we charge the newly
allocated swapcache page as memory, while the swap slot in turn must
remain charged to the swap counter as long as its allocated too.

The cgroup2 logic was broken by commit 2d1c498072de ("mm: memcontrol: make
swap tracking an integral part of memory control"), because it
accidentally removed the do_memsw_account() check in the branch inside
mem_cgroup_uncharge() that was supposed to tell the difference between the
charge transfer in cgroup1 and the separate counters in cgroup2.

As a result, cgroup2 currently undercounts retained swap to varying
degrees: swap slots are cached up to 50% of the configured limit or total
available swap space; partially faulted back shared pages are only limited
by physical capacity.  This in turn allows cgroups to significantly
overconsume their alloted swap space.

Add the do_memsw_account() check back to fix this problem.
