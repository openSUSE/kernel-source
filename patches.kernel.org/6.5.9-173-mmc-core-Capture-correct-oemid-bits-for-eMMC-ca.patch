Subject: [PATCH] mmc: core: Capture correct oemid-bits for eMMC cards
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.9
Git-commit: 84ee19bffc9306128cd0f1c650e89767079efeff

commit 84ee19bffc9306128cd0f1c650e89767079efeff upstream.

The OEMID is an 8-bit binary number rather than 16-bit as the current code
parses for. The OEMID occupies bits [111:104] in the CID register, see the
eMMC spec JESD84-B51 paragraph 7.2.3. It seems that the 16-bit comes from
the legacy MMC specs (v3.31 and before).

Let's fix the parsing by simply move to use 8-bit instead of 16-bit. This
means we ignore the impact on some of those old MMC cards that may be out
there, but on the other hand this shouldn't be a problem as the OEMID seems
not be an important feature for these cards.
