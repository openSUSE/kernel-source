Subject: [PATCH] LoongArch, bpf: Fix jit to skip speculation barrier opcode
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.25
Git-commit: a6f6a95f25803500079513780d11a911ce551d76

[ Upstream commit a6f6a95f25803500079513780d11a911ce551d76 ]

Just skip the opcode(BPF_ST | BPF_NOSPEC) in the BPF JIT instead of
failing to JIT the entire program, given LoongArch currently has no
couterpart of a speculation barrier instruction. To verify the issue,
use the ltp testcase as shown below.

Also, Wang says:

  I can confirm there's currently no speculation barrier equivalent
  on LonogArch. (Loongson says there are builtin mitigations for
  Spectre-V1 and V2 on their chips, and AFAIK efforts to port the
  exploits to mips/LoongArch have all failed a few years ago.)

Without this patch:

  $ ./bpf_prog02
  [...]
  bpf_common.c:123: TBROK: Failed verification: ??? (524)
  [...]

With this patch:

  $ ./bpf_prog02
  [...]
