Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: samsung: exynos4210-trats: turn off SDIO WLAN chip
 during system suspend
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.63
Git-commit: 97cc9c346b2c9cde075b9420fc172137d2427711

[ Upstream commit 97cc9c346b2c9cde075b9420fc172137d2427711 ]

Commit 8c3170628a9c ("wifi: brcmfmac: keep power during suspend if board
requires it") changed default behavior of the BRCMFMAC driver, which now
keeps SDIO card powered during system suspend to enable optional support
for WOWL. This feature is not supported by the legacy Exynos4 based
boards and leads to WLAN disfunction after system suspend/resume cycle.
Fix this by annotating SDIO host used by WLAN chip with
'cap-power-off-card' property, which should have been there from the
beginning.
