Subject: [PATCH] route: set the deleted fnhe fnhe_daddr to 0 in ip_del_fnhe to
 fix a race
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.3
Git-commit: ee60ad219f5c7c4fb2f047f88037770063ef785f

[ Upstream commit ee60ad219f5c7c4fb2f047f88037770063ef785f ]

The race occurs in __mkroute_output() when 2 threads lookup a dst:

  CPU A                 CPU B
  find_exception()
                        find_exception() [fnhe expires]
                        ip_del_fnhe() [fnhe is deleted]
  rt_bind_exception()

In rt_bind_exception() it will bind a deleted fnhe with the new dst, and
this dst will get no chance to be freed. It causes a dev defcnt leak and
consecutive dmesg warnings:

  unregister_netdevice: waiting for ethX to become free. Usage count = 1

Especially thanks Jon to identify the issue.

This patch fixes it by setting fnhe_daddr to 0 in ip_del_fnhe() to stop
binding the deleted fnhe with a new dst when checking fnhe's fnhe_daddr
and daddr in rt_bind_exception().

It works as both ip_del_fnhe() and rt_bind_exception() are protected by
fnhe_lock and the fhne is freed by kfree_rcu().
