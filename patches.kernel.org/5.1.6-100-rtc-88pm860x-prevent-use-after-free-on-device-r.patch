Subject: [PATCH] rtc: 88pm860x: prevent use-after-free on device remove
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.6
Git-commit: f22b1ba15ee5785aa028384ebf77dd39e8e47b70

[ Upstream commit f22b1ba15ee5785aa028384ebf77dd39e8e47b70 ]

The device's remove() attempts to shut down the delayed_work scheduled
on the kernel-global workqueue by calling flush_scheduled_work().

Unfortunately, flush_scheduled_work() does not prevent the delayed_work
from re-scheduling itself. The delayed_work might run after the device
has been removed, and touch the already de-allocated info structure.
This is a potential use-after-free.

Fix by calling cancel_delayed_work_sync() during remove(): this ensures
that the delayed work is properly cancelled, is no longer running, and
is not able to re-schedule itself.

This issue was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
