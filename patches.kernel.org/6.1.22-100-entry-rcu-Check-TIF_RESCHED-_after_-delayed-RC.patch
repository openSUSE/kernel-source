Subject: [PATCH] entry/rcu: Check TIF_RESCHED _after_ delayed RCU wake-up
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.22
Git-commit: b416514054810cf2d2cc348ae477cea619b64da7

[ Upstream commit b416514054810cf2d2cc348ae477cea619b64da7 ]

RCU sometimes needs to perform a delayed wake up for specific kthreads
handling offloaded callbacks (RCU_NOCB).  These wakeups are performed
by timers and upon entry to idle (also to guest and to user on nohz_full).

However the delayed wake-up on kernel exit is actually performed after
the thread flags are fetched towards the fast path check for work to
do on exit to user. As a result, and if there is no other pending work
to do upon that kernel exit, the current task will resume to userspace
with TIF_RESCHED set and the pending wake up ignored.

Fix this with fetching the thread flags _after_ the delayed RCU-nocb
kthread wake-up.

Fixes: 47b8ff194c1f ("entry: Explicitly flush pending rcuog wakeup before last rescheduling point")
