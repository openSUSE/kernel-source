Subject: [PATCH] atm: he: fix sign-extension overflow on large shift
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.13
Git-commit: cb12d72b27a6f41325ae23a11033cf5fedfa1b97

[ Upstream commit cb12d72b27a6f41325ae23a11033cf5fedfa1b97 ]

Shifting the 1 by exp by an int can lead to sign-extension overlow when
exp is 31 since 1 is an signed int and sign-extending this result to an
unsigned long long will set the upper 32 bits.  Fix this by shifting an
unsigned long.

Detected by cppcheck:
(warning) Shifting signed 32-bit value by 31 bits is undefined behaviour
