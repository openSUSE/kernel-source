Subject: [PATCH] net: phy: micrel: always set shared->phydev for LAN8814
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.6
Git-commit: 399d10934740ae8cdaa4e3245f7c5f6c332da844

[ Upstream commit 399d10934740ae8cdaa4e3245f7c5f6c332da844 ]

Currently, during the LAN8814 PTP probe shared->phydev is only set if PTP
clock gets actually set, otherwise the function will return before setting
it.

This is an issue as shared->phydev is unconditionally being used when IRQ
is being handled, especially in lan8814_gpio_process_cap and since it was
not set it will cause a NULL pointer exception and crash the kernel.

So, simply always set shared->phydev to avoid the NULL pointer exception.

Fixes: b3f1a08fcf0d ("net: phy: micrel: Add support for PTP_PF_EXTTS for lan8814")
