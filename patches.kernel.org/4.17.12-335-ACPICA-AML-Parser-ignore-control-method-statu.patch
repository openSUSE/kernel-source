Subject: [PATCH] ACPICA: AML Parser: ignore control method status in
 module-level code
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.12
Git-commit: 460a53106ac39b74625d1104d9a113e0f3716c18

commit 460a53106ac39b74625d1104d9a113e0f3716c18 upstream.

Previous change in the AML parser code blindly set all non-successful
dispatcher statuses to AE_OK. That approach is incorrect, though,
because successful control method invocations from module-level
return AE_CTRL_TRANSFER. Overwriting AE_OK to this status causes the
AML parser to think that there was no return value from the control
method invocation.

Fixes: 92c0f4af386 (ACPICA: AML Parser: ignore dispatcher error status during table load)
