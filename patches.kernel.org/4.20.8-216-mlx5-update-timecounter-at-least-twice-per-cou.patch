Subject: [PATCH] mlx5: update timecounter at least twice per counter overflow
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.8
Git-commit: 5d8678365c90b9ce1fd2243ff5ea562609f6cec1

[ Upstream commit 5d8678365c90b9ce1fd2243ff5ea562609f6cec1 ]

The timecounter needs to be updated at least once in half of the
cyclecounter interval to prevent timecounter_cyc2time() interpreting a
new timestamp as an old value and causing a backward jump.

This would be an issue if the timecounter multiplier was so small that
the update interval would not be limited by the 64-bit overflow in
multiplication.

Shorten the calculated interval to make sure the timecounter is updated
in time even when the system clock is slowed down by up to 10%, the
multiplier is increased by up to 10%, and the scheduled overflow check
is late by 15%.
