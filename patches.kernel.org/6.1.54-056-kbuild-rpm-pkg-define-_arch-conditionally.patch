Subject: [PATCH] kbuild: rpm-pkg: define _arch conditionally
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.54
Git-commit: 233046a2afd12a4f699305b92ee634eebf1e4f31

[ Upstream commit 233046a2afd12a4f699305b92ee634eebf1e4f31 ]

Commit 3089b2be0cce ("kbuild: rpm-pkg: fix build error when _arch is
undefined") does not work as intended; _arch is always defined as
$UTS_MACHINE.

The intention was to define _arch to $UTS_MACHINE only when it is not
defined.
