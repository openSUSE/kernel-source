Subject: [PATCH] kselftest/runner: Print new line in print of timeout log
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.11
Git-commit: d187801d1a46519d2a322f879f7c8f85c685372e

[ Upstream commit d187801d1a46519d2a322f879f7c8f85c685372e ]

If a timeout failure occurs, kselftest kills the test process and prints
the timeout log.  If the test process has killed while printing a log
that ends with new line, the timeout log can be printed in middle of the
test process output so that it can be seems like a comment, as below:

    # test_process_log	not ok 3 selftests: timers: nsleep-lat # TIMEOUT

This commit avoids such problem by printing one more line before the
TIMEOUT failure log.
