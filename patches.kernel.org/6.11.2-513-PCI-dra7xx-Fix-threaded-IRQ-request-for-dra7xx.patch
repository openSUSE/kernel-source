commit 03f84b3baba7836bdfc162c19288d5ce1aa92890 upstream.

Commit da87d35a6e51 ("PCI: dra7xx: Use threaded IRQ handler for
"dra7xx-pcie-main" IRQ") switched from devm_request_irq() to
devm_request_threaded_irq() for the "dra7xx-pcie-main" interrupt.

Since the primary handler was set to NULL, the "IRQF_ONESHOT" flag
should have also been set. Fix this.
