Subject: [PATCH] net: dsa: sja1105: fix bandwidth discrepancy between tc-cbs
 software and offload
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.54

[ Upstream commit 954ad9bf13c4f95a4958b5f8433301f2ab99e1f5 ]

More careful measurement of the tc-cbs bandwidth shows that the stream
bandwidth (effectively idleslope) increases, there is a larger and
larger discrepancy between the rate limit obtained by the software
Qdisc, and the rate limit obtained by its offloaded counterpart.

The discrepancy becomes so large, that e.g. at an idleslope of 40000
(40Mbps), the offloaded cbs does not actually rate limit anything, and
traffic will pass at line rate through a 100 Mbps port.

The reason for the discrepancy is that the hardware documentation I've
been following is incorrect. UM11040.pdf (for SJA1105P/Q/R/S) states
about IDLE_SLOPE that it is "the rate (in unit of bytes/sec) at which
the credit counter is increased".

Cross-checking with UM10944.pdf (for SJA1105E/T) and UM11107.pdf
(for SJA1110), the wording is different: "This field specifies the
value, in bytes per second times link speed, by which the credit counter
is increased".

So there's an extra scaling for link speed that the driver is currently
not accounting for, and apparently (empirically), that link speed is
expressed in Kbps.

I've pondered whether to pollute the sja1105_mac_link_up()
implementation with CBS shaper reprogramming, but I don't think it is
worth it. IMO, the UAPI exposed by tc-cbs requires user space to
recalculate the sendslope anyway, since the formula for that depends on
port_transmit_rate (see man tc-cbs), which is not an invariant from tc's
perspective.

So we use the offload->sendslope and offload->idleslope to deduce the
original port_transmit_rate from the CBS formula, and use that value to
scale the offload->sendslope and offload->idleslope to values that the
hardware understands.

Some numerical data points:

 40Mbps stream, max interfering frame size 1500, port speed 100M
 ---------------------------------------------------------------

 tc-cbs parameters:
 idleslope 40000 sendslope -60000 locredit -900 hicredit 600

 which result in hardware values:

 credit_lo    900                900
 send_slope   7500000            75
 idle_slope   5000000            50

 40Mbps stream, max interfering frame size 1500, port speed 1G
 -------------------------------------------------------------

 tc-cbs parameters:
 idleslope 40000 sendslope -960000 locredit -1440 hicredit 60

 which result in hardware values:

 credit_lo    1440               1440

 -----------------------------------------------------------------

 tc-cbs parameters:
 idleslope 5120 sendslope -94880 locredit -1444 hicredit 77

 which result in hardware values:

 Before (doesn't work)           After (works)
 credit_hi    77                 77
 credit_lo    1444               1444
 send_slope   11860000           118
 idle_slope   640000             6

Tested on SJA1105T, SJA1105S and SJA1110A, at 1Gbps and 100Mbps.
