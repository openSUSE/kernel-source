Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: Avoid possible qgroup_rsv_size overflow in
 btrfs_calculate_inode_block_rsv_size
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.6
Git-commit: 139a56170de67101791d6e6c8e940c6328393fe9

commit 139a56170de67101791d6e6c8e940c6328393fe9 upstream.

qgroup_rsv_size is calculated as the product of
outstanding_extent * fs_info->nodesize. The product is calculated with
32 bit precision since both variables are defined as u32. Yet
qgroup_rsv_size expects a 64 bit result.

Avoid possible multiplication overflow by casting outstanding_extent to
u64. Such overflow would in the worst case (64K nodesize) require more
than 65536 extents, which is quite large and i'ts not likely that it
would happen in practice.
