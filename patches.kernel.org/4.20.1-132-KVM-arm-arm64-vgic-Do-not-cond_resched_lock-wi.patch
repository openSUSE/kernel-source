Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Do not cond_resched_lock() with IRQs
 disabled
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.1
Git-commit: 2e2f6c3c0b08eed3fcf7de3c7684c940451bdeb1

commit 2e2f6c3c0b08eed3fcf7de3c7684c940451bdeb1 upstream.

To change the active state of an MMIO, halt is requested for all vcpus of
the affected guest before modifying the IRQ state. This is done by calling
cond_resched_lock() in vgic_mmio_change_active(). However interrupts are
disabled at this point and we cannot reschedule a vcpu.

We actually don't need any of this, as kvm_arm_halt_guest ensures that
all the other vcpus are out of the guest. Let's just drop that useless
code.
