Subject: [PATCH] fs: fix lazytime expiration handling in
 __writeback_single_inode()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.11
Git-commit: 1e249cb5b7fc09ff216aa5a12f6c302e434e88f9

commit 1e249cb5b7fc09ff216aa5a12f6c302e434e88f9 upstream.

When lazytime is enabled and an inode is being written due to its
in-memory updated timestamps having expired, either due to a sync() or
syncfs() system call or due to dirtytime_expire_interval having elapsed,
the VFS needs to inform the filesystem so that the filesystem can copy
the inode's timestamps out to the on-disk data structures.

This is done by __writeback_single_inode() calling
mark_inode_dirty_sync(), which then calls ->dirty_inode(I_DIRTY_SYNC).

However, this occurs after __writeback_single_inode() has already
cleared the dirty flags from ->i_state.  This causes two bugs:

- mark_inode_dirty_sync() redirties the inode, causing it to remain
  dirty.  This wastefully causes the inode to be written twice.  But
  more importantly, it breaks cases where sync_filesystem() is expected
  to clean dirty inodes.  This includes the FS_IOC_REMOVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY
  ioctl (as reported at
  https://lore.kernel.org/r/20200306004555.GB225345@gmail.com), as well
  as possibly filesystem freezing (freeze_super()).

- Since ->i_state doesn't contain I_DIRTY_TIME when ->dirty_inode() is
  called from __writeback_single_inode() for lazytime expiration,
  xfs_fs_dirty_inode() ignores the notification.  (XFS only cares about
  lazytime expirations, and it assumes that i_state will contain
  I_DIRTY_TIME during those.)  Therefore, lazy timestamps aren't
  persisted by sync(), syncfs(), or dirtytime_expire_interval on XFS.

Fix this by moving the call to mark_inode_dirty_sync() to earlier in
__writeback_single_inode(), before the dirty flags are cleared from
i_state.  This makes filesystems be properly notified of the timestamp
expiration, and it avoids incorrectly redirtying the inode.

This fixes xfstest generic/580 (which tests
FS_IOC_REMOVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY) when run on ext4 or f2fs with lazytime
enabled.  It also fixes the new lazytime xfstest I've proposed, which
reproduces the above-mentioned XFS bug
(https://lore.kernel.org/r/20210105005818.92978-1-ebiggers@kernel.org).

Alternatively, we could call ->dirty_inode(I_DIRTY_SYNC) directly.  But
due to the introduction of I_SYNC_QUEUED, mark_inode_dirty_sync() is the
right thing to do because mark_inode_dirty_sync() now knows not to move
the inode to a writeback list if it is currently queued for sync.
