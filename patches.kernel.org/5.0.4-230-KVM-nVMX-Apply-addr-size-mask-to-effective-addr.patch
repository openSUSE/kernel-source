Subject: [PATCH] KVM: nVMX: Apply addr size mask to effective address for VMX
 instructions
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.4
Git-commit: 8570f9e881e3fde98801bb3a47eef84dd934d405

commit 8570f9e881e3fde98801bb3a47eef84dd934d405 upstream.

The address size of an instruction affects the effective address, not
the virtual/linear address.  The final address may still be truncated,
e.g. to 32-bits outside of long mode, but that happens irrespective of
the address size, e.g. a 32-bit address size can yield a 64-bit virtual
address when using FS/GS with a non-zero base.
