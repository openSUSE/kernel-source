Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm64: vgic: Resample HW pending state on deactivation
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.4
Git-commit: 3134cc8beb69d0db9de651081707c4651c011621

commit 3134cc8beb69d0db9de651081707c4651c011621 upstream.

When a mapped level interrupt (a timer, for example) is deactivated
by the guest, the corresponding host interrupt is equally deactivated.
However, the fate of the pending state still needs to be dealt
with in SW.

This is specially true when the interrupt was in the active+pending
state in the virtual distributor at the point where the guest
was entered. On exit, the pending state is potentially stale
(the guest may have put the interrupt in a non-pending state).

If we don't do anything, the interrupt will be spuriously injected
in the guest. Although this shouldn't have any ill effect (spurious
interrupts are always possible), we can improve the emulation by
detecting the deactivation-while-pending case and resample the
interrupt.

While we're at it, move the logic into a common helper that can
be shared between the two GIC implementations.
