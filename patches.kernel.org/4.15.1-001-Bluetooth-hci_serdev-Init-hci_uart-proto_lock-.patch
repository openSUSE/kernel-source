Subject: [PATCH] Bluetooth: hci_serdev: Init hci_uart proto_lock to avoid oops

commit d73e172816652772114827abaa2dbc053eecbbd7 upstream.

John Stultz reports a boot time crash with the HiKey board (which uses
hci_serdev) occurring in hci_uart_tx_wakeup().  That function is
contained in hci_ldisc.c, but also called from the newer hci_serdev.c.
It acquires the proto_lock in struct hci_uart and it turns out that we
forgot to init the lock in the serdev code path, thus causing the crash.

John bisected the crash to commit 67d2f8781b9f ("Bluetooth: hci_ldisc:
Allow sleeping while proto locks are held"), but the issue was present
before and the commit merely exposed it.  (Perhaps by luck, the crash
did not occur with rwlocks.)

Init the proto_lock in the serdev code path to avoid the oops.

Stack trace for posterity:
