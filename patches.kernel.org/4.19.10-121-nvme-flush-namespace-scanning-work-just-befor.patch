Subject: [PATCH] nvme: flush namespace scanning work just before removing
 namespaces
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.10
Git-commit: f6c8e432cb0479255322c5d0335b9f1699a0270c

[ Upstream commit f6c8e432cb0479255322c5d0335b9f1699a0270c ]

nvme_stop_ctrl can be called also for reset flow and there is no need to
flush the scan_work as namespaces are not being removed. This can cause
deadlock in rdma, fc and loop drivers since nvme_stop_ctrl barriers
before controller teardown (and specifically I/O cancellation of the
scan_work itself) takes place, but the scan_work will be blocked anyways
so there is no need to flush it.

Instead, move scan_work flush to nvme_remove_namespaces() where it really
needs to flush.
