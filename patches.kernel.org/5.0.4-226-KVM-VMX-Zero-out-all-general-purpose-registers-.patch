Subject: [PATCH] KVM: VMX: Zero out *all* general purpose registers after
 VM-Exit
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.4
Git-commit: 0e0ab73c9a0243736bcd779b30b717e23ba9a56d

commit 0e0ab73c9a0243736bcd779b30b717e23ba9a56d upstream.

...except RSP, which is restored by hardware as part of VM-Exit.

Paolo theorized that restoring registers from the stack after a VM-Exit
in lieu of zeroing them could lead to speculative execution with the
guest's values, e.g. if the stack accesses miss the L1 cache[1].
Zeroing XORs are dirt cheap, so just be ultra-paranoid.

Note that the scratch register (currently RCX) used to save/restore the
guest state is also zeroed as its host-defined value is loaded via the
stack, just with a MOV instead of a POP.
