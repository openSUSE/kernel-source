Subject: [PATCH] PM: EM: Fix incorrect description of the cost field in struct
 em_perf_state
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.67
Git-commit: 54b603f2db6b95495bc33a8f2bde80f044baff9a

[ Upstream commit 54b603f2db6b95495bc33a8f2bde80f044baff9a ]

Due to commit 1b600da51073 ("PM: EM: Optimize em_cpu_energy() and remove
division"), the logic for energy consumption calculation has been modified.
The actual calculation of cost is 10 * power * max_frequency / frequency
instead of power * max_frequency / frequency.

Therefore, the comment for cost has been updated to reflect the correct
content.
