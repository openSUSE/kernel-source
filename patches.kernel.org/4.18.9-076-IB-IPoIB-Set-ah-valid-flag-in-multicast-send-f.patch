Subject: [PATCH] IB/IPoIB: Set ah valid flag in multicast send flow
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.9
Git-commit: 75da96067ade4e7854379ec2f7834f3497652b1a

[ Upstream commit 75da96067ade4e7854379ec2f7834f3497652b1a ]

The change of ipoib_ah data structure with adding "valid" flag and
checks of ah->valid in ipoib_start_xmit affected multicast packet flow.

Since the multicast flow doesn't invoke path_rec_start, "ah->valid" flag
remains unset, so that ipoib_start_xmit end up with neigh_refresh_path
instead of sending the packet using neigh.

"ah->valid" has to be set in multicast send flow. As a result IPoIB
starts sending packets via neigh immediately and eliminates 60sec delay
of neigh keep alive interval.

The typical example of this issue are two sequential arpings:

arping 11.134.208.9 -> got response (mcast_send)
arping 11.134.208.9 -> no response  (ah->valid = 0)
