Subject: [PATCH] ice: Don't allow same value for Rx tail to be written twice
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.8
Git-commit: 168983a8e19b89efd175661e53faa6246be363a0

[ Upstream commit 168983a8e19b89efd175661e53faa6246be363a0 ]

Currently we compare the value we are about to write to the Rx tail
register with the previous value of next_to_use. The problem with this
is we only write tail on 8 descriptor boundaries, but next_to_use is
updated whenever we clean Rx descriptors. Fix this by comparing the
value we are about to write to tail with the previously written tail
value. This will prevent duplicate Rx tail bumps.
