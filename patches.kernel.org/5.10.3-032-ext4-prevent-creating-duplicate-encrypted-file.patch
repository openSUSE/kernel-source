Subject: [PATCH] ext4: prevent creating duplicate encrypted filenames
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.3
Git-commit: 75d18cd1868c2aee43553723872c35d7908f240f

commit 75d18cd1868c2aee43553723872c35d7908f240f upstream.

As described in "fscrypt: add fscrypt_is_nokey_name()", it's possible to
create a duplicate filename in an encrypted directory by creating a file
concurrently with adding the directory's encryption key.

Fix this bug on ext4 by rejecting no-key dentries in ext4_add_entry().

Note that the duplicate check in ext4_find_dest_de() sometimes prevented
this bug.  However in many cases it didn't, since ext4_find_dest_de()
doesn't examine every dentry.

Fixes: 4461471107b7 ("ext4 crypto: enable filename encryption")
