Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/xive: Fix trying to "push" an already active pool VP
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.4
Git-commit: b32e56e5a87a1f9243db92bc7a5df0ffb4627cfb

commit b32e56e5a87a1f9243db92bc7a5df0ffb4627cfb upstream.

When setting up a CPU, we "push" (activate) a pool VP for it.

However it's an error to do so if it already has an active
pool VP.

This happens when doing soft CPU hotplug on powernv since we
don't tear down the CPU on unplug. The HW flags the error which
gets captured by the diagnostics.

Fix this by making sure to "pull" out any already active pool
first.
