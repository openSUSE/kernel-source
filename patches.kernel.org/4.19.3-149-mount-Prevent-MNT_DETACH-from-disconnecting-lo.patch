I tracked this down to put_mnt_ns running passing UMOUNT_SYNC and
disconnecting all of the mounts in a mount namespace.  Fix this by
factoring drop_mounts out of drop_collected_mounts and passing
0 instead of UMOUNT_SYNC.

There are two possible behavior differences that result from this.
- No longer setting UMOUNT_SYNC will no longer set MNT_SYNC_UMOUNT on
  the vfsmounts being unmounted.  This effects the lazy rcu walk by
  kicking the walk out of rcu mode and forcing it to be a non-lazy
  walk.
- No longer disconnecting locked mounts will keep some mounts around
  longer as they stay because the are locked to other mounts.

There are only two users of drop_collected mounts: audit_tree.c and
put_mnt_ns.

In audit_tree.c the mounts are private and there are no rcu lazy walks
only calls to iterate_mounts. So the changes should have no effect
except for a small timing effect as the connected mounts are disconnected.

In put_mnt_ns there may be references from process outside the mount
namespace to the mounts.  So the mounts remaining connected will
be the bug fix that is needed.  That rcu walks are allowed to continue
appears not to be a problem especially as the rcu walk change was about
an implementation detail not about semantics.
