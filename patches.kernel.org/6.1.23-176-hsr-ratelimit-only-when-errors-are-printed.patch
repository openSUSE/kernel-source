Subject: [PATCH] hsr: ratelimit only when errors are printed
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.23
Git-commit: 1b0120e4db0bf2838d1ce741195ce4b7cc100b91

commit 1b0120e4db0bf2838d1ce741195ce4b7cc100b91 upstream.

Recently, when automatically merging -net and net-next in MPTCP devel
tree, our CI reported [1] a conflict in hsr, the same as the one
reported by Stephen in netdev [2].

When looking at the conflict, I noticed it is in fact the v1 [3] that
has been applied in -net and the v2 [4] in net-next. Maybe the v1 was
applied by accident.

As mentioned by Jakub Kicinski [5], the new condition makes more sense
before the net_ratelimit(), not to update net_ratelimit's state which is
unnecessary if we're not going to print either way.

Here, this modification applies the v2 but in -net.
