Subject: [PATCH] tcp: allow TLP in ECN CWR
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.13
Git-commit: b4f70c3d4ec32a2ff4c62e1e2da0da5f55fe12bd

[ Upstream commit b4f70c3d4ec32a2ff4c62e1e2da0da5f55fe12bd ]

This patch enables tail loss probe in cwnd reduction (CWR) state
to detect potential losses. Prior to this patch, since the sender
uses PRR to determine the cwnd in CWR state, the combination of
CWR+PRR plus tcp_tso_should_defer() could cause unnecessary stalls
upon losses: PRR makes cwnd so gentle that tcp_tso_should_defer()
defers sending wait for more ACKs. The ACKs may not come due to
packet losses.

Disallowing TLP when there is unused cwnd had the primary effect
of disallowing TLP when there is TSO deferral, Nagle deferral,
or we hit the rwin limit. Because basically every application
write() or incoming ACK will cause us to run tcp_write_xmit()
to see if we can send more, and then if we sent something we call
tcp_schedule_loss_probe() to see if we should schedule a TLP. At
that point, there are a few common reasons why some cwnd budget
could still be unused:

(a) rwin limit
(b) nagle check
(c) TSO deferral
(d) TSQ

For (d), after the next packet tx completion the TSQ mechanism
will allow us to send more packets, so we don't really need a
TLP (in practice it shouldn't matter whether we schedule one
or not). But for (a), (b), (c) the sender won't send any more
packets until it gets another ACK. But if the whole flight was
lost, or all the ACKs were lost, then we won't get any more ACKs,
and ideally we should schedule and send a TLP to get more feedback.
In particular for a long time we have wanted some kind of timer for
TSO deferral, and at least this would give us some kind of timer
