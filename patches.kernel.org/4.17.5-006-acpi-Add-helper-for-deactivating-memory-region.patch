Subject: [PATCH] acpi: Add helper for deactivating memory region
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.5
Git-commit: d2d2e3c46be5d6dd8001d0eebdf7cafb9bc7006b

commit d2d2e3c46be5d6dd8001d0eebdf7cafb9bc7006b upstream.

Sometimes memory resource may be overlapping with
SystemMemory Operation Region by design, for example if the
memory region is used as a mailbox for communication with a
firmware in the system. One occasion of such mailboxes is
USB Type-C Connector System Software Interface (UCSI).

With regions like that, it is important that the driver is
able to map the memory with the requirements it has. For
example, the driver should be allowed to map the memory as
non-cached memory. However, if the operation region has been
accessed before the driver has mapped the memory, the memory
has been marked as write-back by the time the driver is
loaded. That means the driver will fail to map the memory
if it expects non-cached memory.

To work around the problem, introducing helper that the
drivers can use to temporarily deactivate (unmap)
SystemMemory Operation Regions that overlap with their
IO memory.
