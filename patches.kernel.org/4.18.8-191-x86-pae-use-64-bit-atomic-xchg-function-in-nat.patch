Subject: [PATCH] x86/pae: use 64 bit atomic xchg function in
 native_ptep_get_and_clear
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.8
Git-commit: b2d7a075a1ccef2fb321d595802190c8e9b39004

commit b2d7a075a1ccef2fb321d595802190c8e9b39004 upstream.

Using only 32-bit writes for the pte will result in an intermediate
L1TF vulnerable PTE. When running as a Xen PV guest this will at once
switch the guest to shadow mode resulting in a loss of performance.

Use arch_atomic64_xchg() instead which will perform the requested
operation atomically with all 64 bits.

Some performance considerations according to:

https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/ad/dc/Intel-Xeon-Scalable-Processor-throughput-latency.pdf

The main number should be the latency, as there is no tight loop around
native_ptep_get_and_clear().

"lock cmpxchg8b" has a latency of 20 cycles, while "lock xchg" (with a
memory operand) isn't mentioned in that document. "lock xadd" (with xadd
having 3 cycles less latency than xchg) has a latency of 11, so we can
assume a latency of 14 for "lock xchg".
