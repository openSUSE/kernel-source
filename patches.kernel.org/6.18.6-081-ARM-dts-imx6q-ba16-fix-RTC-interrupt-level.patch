Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx6q-ba16: fix RTC interrupt level
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.6
Git-commit: e6a4eedd49ce27c16a80506c66a04707e0ee0116

[ Upstream commit e6a4eedd49ce27c16a80506c66a04707e0ee0116 ]

RTC interrupt level should be set to "LOW". This was revealed by the
introduction of commit:

  f181987ef477 ("rtc: m41t80: use IRQ flags obtained from fwnode")

which changed the way IRQ type is obtained.

Fixes: 56c27310c1b4 ("ARM: dts: imx: Add Advantech BA-16 Qseven module")
