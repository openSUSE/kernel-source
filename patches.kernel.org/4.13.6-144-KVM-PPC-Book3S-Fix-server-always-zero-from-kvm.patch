Subject: [PATCH] KVM: PPC: Book3S: Fix server always zero from
 kvmppc_xive_get_xive()

commit 2fb1e946450a4fef74bb72f360555f7760d816f0 upstream.

In KVM's XICS-on-XIVE emulation, kvmppc_xive_get_xive() returns the
value of state->guest_server as "server". However, this value is not
set by it's counterpart kvmppc_xive_set_xive(). When the guest uses
this interface to migrate interrupts away from a CPU that is going
offline, it sees all interrupts as belonging to CPU 0, so they are
left assigned to (now) offline CPUs.

This patch removes the guest_server field from the state, and returns
act_server in it's place (that is, the CPU actually handling the
interrupt, which may differ from the one requested).

Fixes: 5af50993850a ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Native usage of the XIVE interrupt controller")
