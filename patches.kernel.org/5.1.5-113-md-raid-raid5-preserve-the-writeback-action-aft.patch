Subject: [PATCH] md/raid: raid5 preserve the writeback action after the parity
 check
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.5
Git-commit: b2176a1dfb518d870ee073445d27055fea64dfb8

commit b2176a1dfb518d870ee073445d27055fea64dfb8 upstream.

The problem is that any 'uptodate' vs 'disks' check is not precise
in this path. Put a "WARN_ON(!test_bit(R5_UPTODATE, &dev->flags)" on the
device that might try to kick off writes and then skip the action.
Better to prevent the raid driver from taking unexpected action *and* keep
the system alive vs killing the machine with BUG_ON.

Note: fixed warning reported by kbuild test robot <lkp@intel.com>
