Subject: [PATCH] io_uring: treat -EAGAIN for REQ_F_NOWAIT as final for io-wq
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.42
Git-commit: a9be202269580ca611c6cebac90eaf1795497800

commit a9be202269580ca611c6cebac90eaf1795497800 upstream.

io-wq assumes that an issue is blocking, but it may not be if the
request type has asked for a non-blocking attempt. If we get
-EAGAIN for that case, then we need to treat it as a final result
and not retry or arm poll for it.
