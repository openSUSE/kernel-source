Subject: [PATCH] PCI: imx6: Fix link training status detection in link up
 check
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.10
Git-commit: 68bc10bf992180f269816ff3d22eb30383138577

[ Upstream commit 68bc10bf992180f269816ff3d22eb30383138577 ]

This bug was introduced in the interaction for two commits on either
branch of the merge commit 562df5c8521e ("Merge branch
'pci/host-designware' into next").

Commit 4d107d3b5a68 ("PCI: imx6: Move link up check into
imx6_pcie_wait_for_link()"), changed imx6_pcie_wait_for_link() to poll
the link status register directly, checking for link up and not
training, and made imx6_pcie_link_up() only check the link up bit (once,
not a polling loop).

While commit 886bc5ceb5cc ("PCI: designware: Add generic
dw_pcie_wait_for_link()"), replaced the loop in
imx6_pcie_wait_for_link() with a call to a new dwc core function, which
polled imx6_pcie_link_up(), which still checked both link up and not
training in a loop.

When these two commits were merged, the version of
imx6_pcie_wait_for_link() from 886bc5ceb5cc was kept, which eliminated
the link training check placed there by 4d107d3b5a68. However, the
version of imx6_pcie_link_up() from 4d107d3b5a68 was kept, which
eliminated the link training check that had been there and was moved to
imx6_pcie_wait_for_link().

The result was the link training check got lost for the imx6 driver.

Eliminate imx6_pcie_link_up() so that the default handler,
dw_pcie_link_up(), is used instead. The default handler has the correct
code, which checks for link up and also that it still is not training,
fixing the regression.
