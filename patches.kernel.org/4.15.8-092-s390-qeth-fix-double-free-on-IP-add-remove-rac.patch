Subject: [PATCH] s390/qeth: fix double-free on IP add/remove race
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.8
Git-commit: 14d066c3531a87f727968cacd85bd95c75f59843

[ Upstream commit 14d066c3531a87f727968cacd85bd95c75f59843 ]

Registering an IPv4 address with the HW takes quite a while, so we
temporarily drop the ip_htable lock. Any concurrent add/remove of the
same IP adjusts the IP's use count, and (on remove) is then blocked by
addr->in_progress.
After the register call has completed, we check the use count for
concurrently attempted add/remove calls - and possibly straight-away
deregister the IP again. This happens via l3_delete_ip(), which
1) looks up the queried IP in the htable (getting a reference to the
   *same* queried object),
2) deregisters the IP from the HW, and
3) frees the IP object.

The caller in l3_add_ip() then does a second free on the same object.

For this case, skip all the extra checks and lookups in l3_delete_ip()
and just deregister & free the IP object ourselves.
