Subject: [PATCH] selinux: skip bounded transition processing if the policy
 isn't loaded
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.6
Git-commit: 4b14752ec4e0d87126e636384cf37c8dd9df157c

commit 4b14752ec4e0d87126e636384cf37c8dd9df157c upstream.

We can't do anything reasonable in security_bounded_transition() if we
don't have a policy loaded, and in fact we could run into problems
with some of the code inside expecting a policy.  Fix these problems
like we do many others in security/selinux/ss/services.c by checking
to see if the policy is loaded (ss_initialized) and returning quickly
if it isn't.
