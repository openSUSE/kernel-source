Subject: [PATCH] mtd: rawnand: brcmnand: Fix crash during the panic_write
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.54
Git-commit: e66dd317194daae0475fe9e5577c80aa97f16cb9

commit e66dd317194daae0475fe9e5577c80aa97f16cb9 upstream.

When executing a NAND command within the panic write path, wait for any
pending command instead of calling BUG_ON to avoid crashing while
already crashing.

Fixes: 27c5b17cd1b1 ("mtd: nand: add NAND driver "library" for Broadcom STB NAND controller")
