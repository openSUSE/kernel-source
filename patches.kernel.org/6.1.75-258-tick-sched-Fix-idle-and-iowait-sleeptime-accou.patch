Subject: [PATCH] tick-sched: Fix idle and iowait sleeptime accounting vs CPU
 hotplug
References: bsc#1218052
Patch-mainline: 6.1.75
Git-commit: 71fee48fb772ac4f6cfa63dbebc5629de8b4cc09

commit 71fee48fb772ac4f6cfa63dbebc5629de8b4cc09 upstream.

When offlining and onlining CPUs the overall reported idle and iowait
times as reported by /proc/stat jump backward and forward:

cpu  132 0 176 225249 47 6 6 21 0 0
cpu0 80 0 115 112575 33 3 4 18 0 0
cpu1 52 0 60 112673 13 3 1 2 0 0

cpu  133 0 177 226681 47 6 6 21 0 0
cpu0 80 0 116 113387 33 3 4 18 0 0

cpu  133 0 178 114431 33 6 6 21 0 0 <---- jump backward
cpu0 80 0 116 114247 33 3 4 18 0 0
cpu1 52 0 61 183 0 3 1 2 0 0        <---- idle + iowait start with 0

cpu  133 0 178 228956 47 6 6 21 0 0 <---- jump forward
cpu0 81 0 117 114929 33 3 4 18 0 0

Reason for this is that get_idle_time() in fs/proc/stat.c has different
sources for both values depending on if a CPU is online or offline:

- if a CPU is online the values may be taken from its per cpu
  tick_cpu_sched structure

- if a CPU is offline the values are taken from its per cpu cpustat
  structure

The problem is that the per cpu tick_cpu_sched structure is set to zero on
CPU offline. See tick_cancel_sched_timer() in kernel/time/tick-sched.c.

Therefore when a CPU is brought offline and online afterwards both its idle
and iowait sleeptime will be zero, causing a jump backward in total system
idle and iowait sleeptime. In a similar way if a CPU is then brought
offline again the total idle and iowait sleeptimes will jump forward.

It looks like this behavior was introduced with commit 4b0c0f294f60
("tick: Cleanup NOHZ per cpu data on cpu down").

This was only noticed now on s390, since we switched to generic idle time
reporting with commit be76ea614460 ("s390/idle: remove arch_cpu_idle_time()
and corresponding code").

Fix this by preserving the values of idle_sleeptime and iowait_sleeptime
members of the per-cpu tick_sched structure on CPU hotplug.
