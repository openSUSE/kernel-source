Subject: [PATCH] Input: synaptics - enable SMBUS on T480 thinkpad trackpad
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.2
Git-commit: abbe3acd7d72ab4633ade6bd24e8306b67e0add3

commit abbe3acd7d72ab4633ade6bd24e8306b67e0add3 upstream.

Thinkpad t480 laptops had some touchpad features disabled, resulting in the
loss of pinch to activities in GNOME, on wayland, and other touch gestures
being slower. This patch adds the touchpad of the t480 to the smbus_pnp_ids
whitelist to enable the extra features. In my testing this does not break
suspend (on fedora, with wayland, and GNOME, using the rc-6 kernel), while
also fixing the feature on a T480.
