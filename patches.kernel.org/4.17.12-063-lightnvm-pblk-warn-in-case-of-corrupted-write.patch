[ Upstream commit e37d07983af9068de0303054542d2652ca917f58 ]

When cleaning up buffer entries as we wrap up, their state should be
"completed". If any of the entries is in "submitted" state, it means
that something bad has happened. Trigger a warning immediately instead of
waiting for the state flag to eventually be updated, thus hiding the
issue.
