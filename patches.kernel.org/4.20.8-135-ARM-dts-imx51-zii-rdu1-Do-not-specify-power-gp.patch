Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx51-zii-rdu1: Do not specify "power-gpio" for
 hpa1
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.8
Git-commit: 79da07dec740a42c70963ebacbd2bf8866af9e20

[ Upstream commit 79da07dec740a42c70963ebacbd2bf8866af9e20 ]

TPA6130A2 SD pin on RDU1 is not really controlled by SoC and instead
is only meant to notify the system that audio was "muted" by external
actors. To accommodate that, drop "power-gpio" property of hpa1 node as
well as specify a name for that GPIO so that userspace can access it.
