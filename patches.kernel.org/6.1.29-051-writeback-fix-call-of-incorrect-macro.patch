Subject: [PATCH] writeback: fix call of incorrect macro
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.29
Git-commit: 3e46c89c74f2c38e5337d2cf44b0b551adff1cb4

[ Upstream commit 3e46c89c74f2c38e5337d2cf44b0b551adff1cb4 ]

 the variable 'history' is of type u16, it may be an error
 that the hweight32 macro was used for it
 I guess macro hweight16 should be used

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.
