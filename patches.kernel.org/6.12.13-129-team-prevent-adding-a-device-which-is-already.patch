Subject: [PATCH] team: prevent adding a device which is already a team device
 lower
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.13
Git-commit: 3fff5da4ca2164bb4d0f1e6cd33f6eb8a0e73e50

[ Upstream commit 3fff5da4ca2164bb4d0f1e6cd33f6eb8a0e73e50 ]

Prevent adding a device which is already a team device lower,
e.g. adding veth0 if vlan1 was already added and veth0 is a lower of
vlan1.

This is not useful in practice and can lead to recursive locking:

$ ip link add veth0 type veth peer name veth1
$ ip link set veth0 up
$ ip link set veth1 up
$ ip link add link veth0 name veth0.1 type vlan protocol 802.1Q id 1
$ ip link add team0 type team
$ ip link set veth0.1 down
$ ip link set veth0.1 master team0
team0: Port device veth0.1 added
$ ip link set veth0 down
$ ip link set veth0 master team0

other info that might help us debug this:
Possible unsafe locking scenario:

May be due to missing lock nesting notation
