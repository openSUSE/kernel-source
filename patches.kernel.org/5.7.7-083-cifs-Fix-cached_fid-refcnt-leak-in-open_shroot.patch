Subject: [PATCH] cifs: Fix cached_fid refcnt leak in open_shroot
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.7
Git-commit: 77577de64167aa0643d47ffbaacf3642632b321b

commit 77577de64167aa0643d47ffbaacf3642632b321b upstream.

open_shroot() invokes kref_get(), which increases the refcount of the
"tcon->crfid" object. When open_shroot() returns not zero, it means the
open operation failed and close_shroot() will not be called to decrement
the refcount of the "tcon->crfid".

The reference counting issue happens in one normal path of
open_shroot(). When the cached root have been opened successfully in a
concurrent process, the function increases the refcount and jump to
"oshr_free" to return. However the current return value "rc" may not
equal to 0, thus the increased refcount will not be balanced outside the
function, causing a refcnt leak.

Fix this issue by setting the value of "rc" to 0 before jumping to
"oshr_free" label.
