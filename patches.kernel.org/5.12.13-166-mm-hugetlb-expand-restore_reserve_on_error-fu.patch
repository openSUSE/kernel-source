Subject: [PATCH] mm/hugetlb: expand restore_reserve_on_error functionality
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.13
Git-commit: 846be08578edb81f02bc8534577e6c367ef34f41

commit 846be08578edb81f02bc8534577e6c367ef34f41 upstream.

The routine restore_reserve_on_error is called to restore reservation
information when an error occurs after page allocation.  The routine
alloc_huge_page modifies the mapping reserve map and potentially the
reserve count during allocation.  If code calling alloc_huge_page
encounters an error after allocation and needs to free the page, the
reservation information needs to be adjusted.

Currently, restore_reserve_on_error only takes action on pages for which
the reserve count was adjusted(HPageRestoreReserve flag).  There is
nothing wrong with these adjustments.  However, alloc_huge_page ALWAYS
modifies the reserve map during allocation even if the reserve count is
not adjusted.  This can cause issues as observed during development of
this patch [1].

One specific series of operations causing an issue is:

 - Create a shared hugetlb mapping
   Reservations for all pages created by default

 - Fault in a page in the mapping
   Reservation exists so reservation count is decremented

 - Punch a hole in the file/mapping at index previously faulted
   Reservation and any associated pages will be removed

 - Allocate a page to fill the hole
   No reservation entry, so reserve count unmodified
   Reservation entry added to map by alloc_huge_page

 - Error after allocation and before instantiating the page
   Reservation entry remains in map

 - Allocate a page to fill the hole
   Reservation entry exists, so decrement reservation count

This will cause a reservation count underflow as the reservation count
was decremented twice for the same index.

A user would observe a very large number for HugePages_Rsvd in
/proc/meminfo.  This would also likely cause subsequent allocations of
hugetlb pages to fail as it would 'appear' that all pages are reserved.

This sequence of operations is unlikely to happen, however they were
easily reproduced and observed using hacked up code as described in [1].

Address the issue by having the routine restore_reserve_on_error take
action on pages where HPageRestoreReserve is not set.  In this case, we
need to remove any reserve map entry created by alloc_huge_page.  A new
helper routine vma_del_reservation assists with this operation.

There are three callers of alloc_huge_page which do not currently call
restore_reserve_on error before freeing a page on error paths.  Add
those missing calls.
