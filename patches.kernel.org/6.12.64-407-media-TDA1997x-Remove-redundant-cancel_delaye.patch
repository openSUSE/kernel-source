Subject: [PATCH] media: TDA1997x: Remove redundant cancel_delayed_work in
 probe
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.64
Git-commit: 29de195ca39fc2ac0af6fd45522994df9f431f80

commit 29de195ca39fc2ac0af6fd45522994df9f431f80 upstream.

The delayed_work delayed_work_enable_hpd is initialized with
INIT_DELAYED_WORK(), but it is never scheduled in tda1997x_probe().

Calling cancel_delayed_work() on a work that has never been
scheduled is redundant and unnecessary, as there is no pending
work to cancel.

Remove the redundant cancel_delayed_work() from error handling
path in tda1997x_probe() to avoid potential confusion.
