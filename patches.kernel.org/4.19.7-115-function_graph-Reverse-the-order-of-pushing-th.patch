Subject: [PATCH] function_graph: Reverse the order of pushing the ret_stack
 and the callback
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.7
Git-commit: 7c6ea35ef50810aa12ab26f21cb858d980881576

commit 7c6ea35ef50810aa12ab26f21cb858d980881576 upstream.

The function graph profiler uses the ret_stack to store the "subtime" and
reuse it by nested functions and also on the return. But the current logic
has the profiler callback called before the ret_stack is updated, and it is
just modifying the ret_stack that will later be allocated (it's just lucky
that the "subtime" is not touched when it is allocated).

This could also cause a crash if we are at the end of the ret_stack when
this happens.

By reversing the order of the allocating the ret_stack and then calling the
callbacks attached to a function being traced, the ret_stack entry is no
longer used before it is allocated.
