Subject: [PATCH] blk-mq: avoid to iterate over stale request
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.9
Git-commit: 67f3b2f822b7e71cfc9b42dbd9f3144fa2933e0b

[ Upstream commit 67f3b2f822b7e71cfc9b42dbd9f3144fa2933e0b ]

blk-mq can't run allocating driver tag and updating ->rqs[tag]
atomically, meantime blk-mq doesn't clear ->rqs[tag] after the driver
tag is released.

So there is chance to iterating over one stale request just after the
tag is allocated and before updating ->rqs[tag].

scsi_host_busy_iter() calls scsi_host_check_in_flight() to count scsi
in-flight requests after scsi host is blocked, so no new scsi command can
be marked as SCMD_STATE_INFLIGHT. However, driver tag allocation still can
be run by blk-mq core. One request is marked as SCMD_STATE_INFLIGHT,
but this request may have been kept in another slot of ->rqs[], meantime
the slot can be allocated out but ->rqs[] isn't updated yet. Then this
in-flight request is counted twice as SCMD_STATE_INFLIGHT. This way causes
trouble in handling scsi error.

Fixes the issue by not iterating over stale request.
