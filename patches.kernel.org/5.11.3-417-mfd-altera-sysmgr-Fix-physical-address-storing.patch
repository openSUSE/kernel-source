Subject: [PATCH] mfd: altera-sysmgr: Fix physical address storing more
References: bsc#1012628

[ Upstream commit b0b5b16b78cea1b2b990a69ab8e07a42ccf7a2ed ]

A recent fix improved the way the resource gets passed to
the low-level accessors, but left one warning that appears
in configurations with a resource_size_t that is wider than
a pointer:

      |            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I had tried a different approach that would store the address
in the private data as a phys_addr_t, but the easiest solution
now seems to be to add a double cast to shut up the warning.

As the address is passed to an inline assembly, it is guaranteed
to not be wider than a register anyway.
