Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: usb-audio: Disable sample read check if firmware
 doesn't give back
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.4
Git-commit: 9df28edce7c6ab38050235f6f8b43dd7ccd01b6d

commit 9df28edce7c6ab38050235f6f8b43dd7ccd01b6d upstream.

Some buggy firmware don't give the current sample rate but leaves
zero.  Handle this case more gracefully without warning but just skip
the current rate verification from the next time.
