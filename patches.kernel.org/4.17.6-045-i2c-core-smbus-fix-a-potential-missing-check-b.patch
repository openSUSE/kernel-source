Subject: [PATCH] i2c: core: smbus: fix a potential missing-check bug
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.6
Git-commit: 8e03477cb709b73a2c1e1f4349ee3b7b33c50416

commit 8e03477cb709b73a2c1e1f4349ee3b7b33c50416 upstream.

In i2c_smbus_xfer_emulated(), the function i2c_transfer() is invoked to
transfer i2c messages. The number of actual transferred messages is
returned and saved to 'status'. If 'status' is negative, that means an
error occurred during the transfer process. In that case, the value of
'status' is an error code to indicate the reason of the transfer failure.
In most cases, i2c_transfer() can transfer 'num' messages with no error.
And so 'status' == 'num'. However, due to unexpected errors, it is probable
that only partial messages are transferred by i2c_transfer(). As a result,
'status' != 'num'. This special case is not checked after the invocation of
i2c_transfer() and can potentially lead to unexpected issues in the
following execution since it is expected that 'status' == 'num'.

This patch checks the return value of i2c_transfer() and returns an error
code -EIO if the number of actual transferred messages 'status' is not
equal to 'num'.
