Subject: [PATCH] mm,memory_failure: always pin the page in
 madvise_inject_error
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.4
Git-commit: 1e8aaedb182d6ddffc894b832e4962629907b3e0

[ Upstream commit 1e8aaedb182d6ddffc894b832e4962629907b3e0 ]

madvise_inject_error() uses get_user_pages_fast to translate the address
we specified to a page.  After [1], we drop the extra reference count for
memory_failure() path.  That commit says that memory_failure wanted to
keep the pin in order to take the page out of circulation.

The truth is that we need to keep the page pinned, otherwise the page
might be re-used after the put_page() and we can end up messing with
someone else's memory.

E.g:

CPU0
process X					CPU1
 madvise_inject_error
  get_user_pages
   put_page
					page gets reclaimed
					process Y allocates the page
  memory_failure
   // We mess with process Y memory

madvise() is meant to operate on a self address space, so messing with
pages that do not belong to us seems the wrong thing to do.
To avoid that, let us keep the page pinned for memory_failure as well.

Pages for DAX mappings will release this extra refcount in
memory_failure_dev_pagemap.
