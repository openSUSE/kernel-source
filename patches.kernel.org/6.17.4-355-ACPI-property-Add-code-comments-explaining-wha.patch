Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: property: Add code comments explaining what is going on
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.4
Git-commit: 737c3a09dcf69ba2814f3674947ccaec1861c985

[ Upstream commit 737c3a09dcf69ba2814f3674947ccaec1861c985 ]

In some places in the ACPI device properties handling code, it is
unclear why the code is what it is.  Some assumptions are not documented
and some pieces of code are based on knowledge that is not mentioned
anywhere.

Add code comments explaining these things.
