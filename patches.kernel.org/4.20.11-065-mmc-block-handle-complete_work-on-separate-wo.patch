Subject: [PATCH] mmc: block: handle complete_work on separate workqueue
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.11
Git-commit: dcf6e2e38a1c7ccbc535de5e1d9b14998847499d

commit dcf6e2e38a1c7ccbc535de5e1d9b14998847499d upstream.

The kblockd workqueue is created with the WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag set.
This generates a rescuer thread for that queue that will trigger when
the CPU is under heavy load and collect the uncompleted work.

In the case of mmc, this creates the possibility of a deadlock when
there are multiple partitions on the device as other blk-mq work is
also run on the same queue. For example:

- worker 0 claims the mmc host to work on partition 1
- worker 1 attempts to claim the host for partition 2 but has to wait
  for worker 0 to finish
- worker 0 schedules complete_work to release the host
- rescuer thread is triggered after time-out and collects the dangling
  work
- rescuer thread attempts to complete the work in order starting with
  claim host
- the task to release host is now blocked by a task to claim it and
  will never be called

The above results in multiple hung tasks that lead to failures to
mount partitions.

Handling complete_work on a separate workqueue avoids this by keeping
the work completion tasks separate from the other blk-mq work. This
allows the host to be released without getting blocked by other tasks
attempting to claim the host.
