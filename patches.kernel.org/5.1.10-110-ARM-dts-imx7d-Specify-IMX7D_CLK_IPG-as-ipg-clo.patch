Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx7d: Specify IMX7D_CLK_IPG as "ipg" clock to SDMA
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.10
Git-commit: 412b032a1dc72fc9d1c258800355efa6671b6315

[ Upstream commit 412b032a1dc72fc9d1c258800355efa6671b6315 ]

Since 25aaa75df1e6 SDMA driver uses clock rates of "ipg" and "ahb"
clock to determine if it needs to configure the IP block as operating
at 1:1 or 1:2 clock ratio (ACR bit in SDMAARM_CONFIG). Specifying both
clocks as IMX7D_CLK_SDMA results in driver incorrectly thinking that
ratio is 1:1 which results in broken SDMA funtionality. Fix the code
to specify IMX7D_CLK_IPG as "ipg" clock for SDMA, to avoid detecting
incorrect clock ratio.
