Subject: [PATCH] watch_queue: Drop references to /dev/watch_queue
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.3
Git-commit: 8fe62e0c0e2efa5437f3ee81b65d69e70a45ecd2

[ Upstream commit 8fe62e0c0e2efa5437f3ee81b65d69e70a45ecd2 ]

The merged API doesn't use a watch_queue device, but instead relies on
pipes, so let the documentation reflect that.

Fixes: f7e47677e39a ("watch_queue: Add a key/keyring notification facility")
