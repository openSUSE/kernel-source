Subject: [PATCH] mmc: jz4740: Fix race condition in IRQ mask update
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.4
Git-commit: a04f0017c22453613d5f423326b190c61e3b4f98

commit a04f0017c22453613d5f423326b190c61e3b4f98 upstream.

A spinlock is held while updating the internal copy of the IRQ mask,
but not while writing it to the actual IMASK register. After the lock
is released, an IRQ can occur before the IMASK register is written.
If handling this IRQ causes the mask to be changed, when the handler
returns back to the middle of the first mask update, a stale value
will be written to the mask register.

If this causes an IRQ to become unmasked that cannot have its status
cleared by writing a 1 to it in the IREG register, e.g. the SDIO IRQ,
then we can end up stuck with the same IRQ repeatedly being fired but
not handled. Normally the MMC IRQ handler attempts to clear any
unexpected IRQs by writing IREG, but for those that cannot be cleared
in this way then the IRQ will just repeatedly fire.

This was resulting in lockups after a while of using Wi-Fi on the
CI20 (GitHub issue #19).

Resolve by holding the spinlock until after the IMASK register has
been updated.
