Subject: [PATCH] LoongArch: KVM: Fix kvm_device leak in kvm_pch_pic_destroy()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.7
Git-commit: 1cf342a7c3adc5877837b53bbceb5cc9eff60bbf

commit 1cf342a7c3adc5877837b53bbceb5cc9eff60bbf upstream.

In kvm_ioctl_create_device(), kvm_device has allocated memory,
kvm_device->destroy() seems to be supposed to free its kvm_device
struct, but kvm_pch_pic_destroy() is not currently doing this, that
would lead to a memory leak.

So, fix it.
