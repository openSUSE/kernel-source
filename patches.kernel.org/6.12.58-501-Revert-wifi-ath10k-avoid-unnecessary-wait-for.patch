Subject: [PATCH] Revert "wifi: ath10k: avoid unnecessary wait for service
 ready message"
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.58
Git-commit: 2469bb6a6af944755a7d7daf66be90f3b8decbf9

commit 2469bb6a6af944755a7d7daf66be90f3b8decbf9 upstream.

This reverts commit 51a73f1b2e56b0324b4a3bb8cebc4221b5be4c7a.

Although this commit benefits QCA6174, it breaks QCA988x and
QCA9984 [1][2]. Since it is not likely to root cause/fix this
issue in a short time, revert it to get those chips back.

Compile tested only.

Fixes: 51a73f1b2e56 ("wifi: ath10k: avoid unnecessary wait for service ready message")
