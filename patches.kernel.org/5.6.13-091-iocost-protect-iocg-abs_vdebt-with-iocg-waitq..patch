Subject: [PATCH] iocost: protect iocg->abs_vdebt with iocg->waitq.lock
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.13
Git-commit: 0b80f9866e6bbfb905140ed8787ff2af03652c0c

commit 0b80f9866e6bbfb905140ed8787ff2af03652c0c upstream.

abs_vdebt is an atomic_64 which tracks how much over budget a given cgroup
is and controls the activation of use_delay mechanism. Once a cgroup goes
over budget from forced IOs, it has to pay it back with its future budget.
The progress guarantee on debt paying comes from the iocg being active -
active iocgs are processed by the periodic timer, which ensures that as time
passes the debts dissipate and the iocg returns to normal operation.

However, both iocg activation and vdebt handling are asynchronous and a
sequence like the following may happen.

1. The iocg is in the process of being deactivated by the periodic timer.

2. A bio enters ioc_rqos_throttle(), calls iocg_activate() which returns
   without anything because it still sees that the iocg is already active.

3. The iocg is deactivated.

4. The bio from #2 is over budget but needs to be forced. It increases
   abs_vdebt and goes over the threshold and enables use_delay.

5. IO control is enabled for the iocg's subtree and now IOs are attributed
   to the descendant cgroups and the iocg itself no longer issues IOs.

This leaves the iocg with stuck abs_vdebt - it has debt but inactive and no
further IOs which can activate it. This can end up unduly punishing all the
descendants cgroups.

The usual throttling path has the same issue - the iocg must be active while
throttled to ensure that future event will wake it up - and solves the
problem by synchronizing the throttling path with a spinlock. abs_vdebt
handling is another form of overage handling and shares a lot of
characteristics including the fact that it isn't in the hottest path.

This patch fixes the above and other possible races by strictly
synchronizing abs_vdebt and use_delay handling with iocg->waitq.lock.
