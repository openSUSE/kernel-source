Subject: [PATCH] cdrom: gdrom: initialize global variable at init time
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.7
Git-commit: 9183f01b5e6e32eb3f17b5f3f8d5ad5ac9786c49

commit 9183f01b5e6e32eb3f17b5f3f8d5ad5ac9786c49 upstream.

As Peter points out, if we were to disconnect and then reconnect this
driver from a device, the "global" state of the device would contain odd
values and could cause problems.  Fix this up by just initializing the
whole thing to 0 at probe() time.

Ideally this would be a per-device variable, but given the age and the
total lack of users of it, that would require a lot of s/./->/g changes
for really no good reason.
