Subject: [PATCH] IB/hfi1: Fix another case where pq is left on waitlist
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.14
Git-commit: fa8dac3968635dec8518a13ac78d662f2aa88e4d

[ Upstream commit fa8dac3968635dec8518a13ac78d662f2aa88e4d ]

The commit noted below fixed a case where a pq is left on the sdma wait
list.

It however missed another case.

user_sdma_send_pkts() has two calls from hfi1_user_sdma_process_request().

If the first one fails as indicated by -EBUSY, the pq will be placed on
the waitlist as by design.

If the second call then succeeds, the pq is still on the waitlist setting
up a race with the interrupt handler if a subsequent request uses a
different SDMA engine

Fix by deleting the first call.

The use of pcount and the intent to send a short burst of packets followed
by the larger balance of packets was never correctly implemented, because
the two calls always send pcount packets no matter what.  A subsequent
patch will correct that issue.
