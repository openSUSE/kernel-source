Subject: [PATCH] sched/nohz: Run NOHZ idle load balancer on HK_FLAG_MISC CPUs
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.6
Git-commit: 9b019acb72e4b5741d88e8936d6f200ed44b66b2

[ Upstream commit 9b019acb72e4b5741d88e8936d6f200ed44b66b2 ]

The NOHZ idle balancer runs on the lowest idle CPU. This can
interfere with isolated CPUs, so confine it to HK_FLAG_MISC
housekeeping CPUs.

HK_FLAG_SCHED is not used for this because it is not set anywhere
at the moment. This could be folded into HK_FLAG_SCHED once that
option is fixed.

The problem was observed with increased jitter on an application
running on CPU0, caused by NOHZ idle load balancing being run on
CPU1 (an SMT sibling).
