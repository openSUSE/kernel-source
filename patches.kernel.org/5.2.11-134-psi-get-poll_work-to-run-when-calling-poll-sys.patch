Subject: [PATCH] psi: get poll_work to run when calling poll syscall next time
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.11
Git-commit: 7b2b55da1db10a5525460633ae4b6fb0be060c41

commit 7b2b55da1db10a5525460633ae4b6fb0be060c41 upstream.

Only when calling the poll syscall the first time can user receive
POLLPRI correctly.  After that, user always fails to acquire the event
signal.

Reproduce case:
 1. Get the monitor code in Documentation/accounting/psi.txt
 2. Run it, and wait for the event triggered.
 3. Kill and restart the process.

The question is why we can end up with poll_scheduled = 1 but the work
not running (which would reset it to 0).  And the answer is because the
scheduling side sees group->poll_kworker under RCU protection and then
schedules it, but here we cancel the work and destroy the worker.  The
cancel needs to pair with resetting the poll_scheduled flag.
