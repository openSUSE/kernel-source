Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/realtek: fix mute/micmute LEDs and speaker for HP
 Zbook G8
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.9
Git-commit: bbe183e07817a46cf8d3d7fc88093df81d23a957

commit bbe183e07817a46cf8d3d7fc88093df81d23a957 upstream.

The HP ZBook Studio 15.6 Inch G8 is using ALC285 codec which is
using 0x04 to control mute LED and 0x01 to control micmute LED.
In the other hand, there is no output from right channel of speaker.
Therefore, add a quirk to make it works.
