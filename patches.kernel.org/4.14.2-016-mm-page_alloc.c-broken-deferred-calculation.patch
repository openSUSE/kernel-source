Subject: [PATCH] mm/page_alloc.c: broken deferred calculation
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.2
Git-commit: d135e5750205a21a212a19dbb05aeb339e2cbea7

commit d135e5750205a21a212a19dbb05aeb339e2cbea7 upstream.

In reset_deferred_meminit() we determine number of pages that must not
be deferred.  We initialize pages for at least 2G of memory, but also
pages for reserved memory in this node.

The reserved memory is determined in this function:
memblock_reserved_memory_within(), which operates over physical
addresses, and returns size in bytes.  However, reset_deferred_meminit()
assumes that that this function operates with pfns, and returns page
count.

The result is that in the best case machine boots slower than expected
due to initializing more pages than needed in single thread, and in the
worst case panics because fewer than needed pages are initialized early.
