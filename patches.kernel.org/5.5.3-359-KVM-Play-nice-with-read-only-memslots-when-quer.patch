Subject: [PATCH] KVM: Play nice with read-only memslots when querying host
 page size
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.3
Git-commit: 42cde48b2d39772dba47e680781a32a6c4b7dc33

[ Upstream commit 42cde48b2d39772dba47e680781a32a6c4b7dc33 ]

Avoid the "writable" check in __gfn_to_hva_many(), which will always fail
on read-only memslots due to gfn_to_hva() assuming writes.  Functionally,
this allows x86 to create large mappings for read-only memslots that
are backed by HugeTLB mappings.

Note, the changelog for commit 05da45583de9 ("KVM: MMU: large page
support") states "If the largepage contains write-protected pages, a
large pte is not used.", but "write-protected" refers to pages that are
temporarily read-only, e.g. read-only memslots didn't even exist at the
time.
