Subject: [PATCH] perf lock: Don't free "lock_seq_stat" if read_count isn't
 zero
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.11
Git-commit: b0e5a05cc9e37763c7f19366d94b1a6160c755bc

[ Upstream commit b0e5a05cc9e37763c7f19366d94b1a6160c755bc ]

When execute command "perf lock report", it hits failure and outputs log
as follows:

  perf: builtin-lock.c:623: report_lock_release_event: Assertion `!(seq->read_count < 0)' failed.
  Aborted

This is an imbalance issue.  The locking sequence structure
"lock_seq_stat" contains the reader counter and it is used to check if
the locking sequence is balance or not between acquiring and releasing.

If the tool wrongly frees "lock_seq_stat" when "read_count" isn't zero,
the "read_count" will be reset to zero when allocate a new structure at
the next time; thus it causes the wrong counting for reader and finally
results in imbalance issue.

To fix this issue, if detects "read_count" is not zero (means still have
read user in the locking sequence), goto the "end" tag to skip freeing
structure "lock_seq_stat".
