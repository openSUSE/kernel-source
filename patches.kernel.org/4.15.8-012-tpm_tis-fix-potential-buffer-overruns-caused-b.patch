Subject: [PATCH] tpm_tis: fix potential buffer overruns caused by bit glitches
 on the bus
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.8
Git-commit: 6bb320ca4a4a7b5b3db8c8d7250cc40002046878

commit 6bb320ca4a4a7b5b3db8c8d7250cc40002046878 upstream.

Discrete TPMs are often connected over slow serial buses which, on
some platforms, can have glitches causing bit flips.  In all the
driver _recv() functions, we need to use a u32 to unmarshal the
response size, otherwise a bit flip of the 31st bit would cause the
expected variable to go negative, which would then try to read a huge
amount of data.  Also sanity check that the expected amount of data is
large enough for the TPM header.
