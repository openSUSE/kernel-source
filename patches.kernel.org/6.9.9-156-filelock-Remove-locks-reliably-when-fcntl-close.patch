Subject: [PATCH] filelock: Remove locks reliably when fcntl/close race is
 detected
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.9
Git-commit: 3cad1bc010416c6dd780643476bc59ed742436b9

commit 3cad1bc010416c6dd780643476bc59ed742436b9 upstream.

When fcntl_setlk() races with close(), it removes the created lock with
do_lock_file_wait().
However, LSMs can allow the first do_lock_file_wait() that created the lock
while denying the second do_lock_file_wait() that tries to remove the lock.
In theory (but AFAIK not in practice), posix_lock_file() could also fail to
remove a lock due to GFP_KERNEL allocation failure (when splitting a range
in the middle).

After the bug has been triggered, use-after-free reads will occur in
lock_get_status() when userspace reads /proc/locks. This can likely be used
to read arbitrary kernel memory, but can't corrupt kernel memory.
This only affects systems with SELinux / Smack / AppArmor / BPF-LSM in
enforcing mode and only works from some security contexts.

Fix it by calling locks_remove_posix() instead, which is designed to
reliably get rid of POSIX locks associated with the given file and
files_struct and is also used by filp_flush().
