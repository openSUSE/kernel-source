Subject: [PATCH] ARM: 8722/1: mm: make STRICT_KERNEL_RWX effective for LPAE
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.3
Git-commit: 400eeffaffc7232c0ae1134fe04e14ae4fb48d8c

commit 400eeffaffc7232c0ae1134fe04e14ae4fb48d8c upstream.

Currently, for ARM kernels with CONFIG_ARM_LPAE and
CONFIG_STRICT_KERNEL_RWX enabled, the 2MiB pages mapping the
kernel code and rodata are writable. They are marked read-only in
a software bit (L_PMD_SECT_RDONLY) but the hardware read-only bit
is not set (PMD_SECT_AP2).

For user mappings, the logic that propagates the software bit
to the hardware bit is in set_pmd_at(); but for the kernel,
section_update() writes the PMDs directly, skipping this logic.

The fix is to set PMD_SECT_AP2 for read-only sections in
section_update(), at the same time as L_PMD_SECT_RDONLY.
