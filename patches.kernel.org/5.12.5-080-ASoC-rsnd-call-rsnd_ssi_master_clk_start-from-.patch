Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: rsnd: call rsnd_ssi_master_clk_start() from
 rsnd_ssi_init()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.5
Git-commit: a122a116fc6d8fcf2f202dcd185173a54268f239

[ Upstream commit a122a116fc6d8fcf2f202dcd185173a54268f239 ]

Current rsnd needs to call .prepare (P) for clock settings,
.trigger for playback start (S) and stop (E).
It should be called as below from SSI point of view.

	P -> S -> E -> P -> S -> E -> ...

But, if you used MIXer, below case might happen

	              (2)
	1: P -> S ---> E -> ...
	2:         P ----> S -> ...
	          (1)     (3)

P(1) setups clock, but E(2) resets it. and starts playback (3).
In such case, it will reports "SSI parent/child should use same rate".

rsnd_ssi_master_clk_start() which is the main function at (P)
was called from rsnd_ssi_init() (= S) before,
but was moved by below patch to rsnd_soc_dai_prepare() (= P) to avoid
using clk_get_rate() which shouldn't be used under atomic context.

	commit 4d230d1271064 ("ASoC: rsnd: fixup not to call clk_get/set
				under non-atomic")

Because of above patch, rsnd_ssi_master_clk_start() is now called at (P)
which is for non atomic context. But (P) is assuming that spin lock is
*not* used.
One issue now is rsnd_ssi_master_clk_start() is checking ssi->xxx
which should be protected by spin lock.

After above patch, adg.c had below patch for other reasons.

	commit 06e8f5c842f2d ("ASoC: rsnd: don't call clk_get_rate()
				under atomic context")

clk_get_rate() is used at probe() timing by this patch.
In other words, rsnd_ssi_master_clk_start() is no longer using
clk_get_rate() any more.

This means we can call it from rsnd_ssi_init() (= S) again which is
protected by spin lock.
This patch re-move it to under spin lock, and solves
1. checking ssi->xxx without spin lock issue.
2. clk setting / device start / device stop race condition.
