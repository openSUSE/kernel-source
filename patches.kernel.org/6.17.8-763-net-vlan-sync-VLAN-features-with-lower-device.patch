Subject: [PATCH] net: vlan: sync VLAN features with lower device
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.8
Git-commit: c211f5d7cbd5cb34489d526648bb9c8ecc907dee

[ Upstream commit c211f5d7cbd5cb34489d526648bb9c8ecc907dee ]

After registering a VLAN device and setting its feature flags, we need to
synchronize the VLAN features with the lower device. For example, the VLAN
device does not have the NETIF_F_LRO flag, it should be synchronized with
the lower device based on the NETIF_F_UPPER_DISABLES definition.

As the dev->vlan_features has changed, we need to call
netdev_update_features(). The caller must run after netdev_upper_dev_link()
links the lower devices, so this patch adds the netdev_update_features()
call in register_vlan_dev().

Fixes: fd867d51f889 ("net/core: generic support for disabling netdev features down stack")
