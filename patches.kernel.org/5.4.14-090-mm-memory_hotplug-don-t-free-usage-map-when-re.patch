Subject: [PATCH] mm/memory_hotplug: don't free usage map when removing a
 re-added early section
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.14
Git-commit: 8068df3b60373c390198f660574ea14c8098de57

commit 8068df3b60373c390198f660574ea14c8098de57 upstream.

When we remove an early section, we don't free the usage map, as the
usage maps of other sections are placed into the same page.  Once the
section is removed, it is no longer an early section (especially, the
memmap is freed).  When we re-add that section, the usage map is reused,
however, it is no longer an early section.  When removing that section
again, we try to kfree() a usage map that was allocated during early
boot - bad.

Let's check against PageReserved() to see if we are dealing with an
usage map that was allocated during boot.  We could also check against
!(PageSlab(usage_page) || PageCompound(usage_page)), but PageReserved() is
cleaner.

Can be triggered using memtrace under ppc64/powernv:

  $ mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug/
  $ echo 0x20000000 > /sys/kernel/debug/powerpc/memtrace/enable
  $ echo 0x20000000 > /sys/kernel/debug/powerpc/memtrace/enable

The first invocation will offline+remove memory blocks.  The second
invocation will first add+online them again, in order to offline+remove
them again (usually we are lucky and the exact same memory blocks will
get "reallocated").

Tested on powernv with boot memory: The usage map will not get freed.
Tested on x86-64 with DIMMs: The usage map will get freed.

Using Dynamic Memory under a Power DLAPR can trigger it easily.

Triggering removal (I assume after previously removed+re-added) of
memory from the HMC GUI can crash the kernel with the same call trace
and is fixed by this patch.
