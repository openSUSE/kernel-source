Subject: [PATCH] Revert "mm/gup: check page posion status for coredump."
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.7
Git-commit: f10628d2f613195132532e0fbda439eeed8d12a2

commit f10628d2f613195132532e0fbda439eeed8d12a2 upstream.

While reviewing [1] I came across commit d3378e86d182 ("mm/gup: check
page posion status for coredump.") and noticed that this patch is broken
in two ways.  First it doesn't really prevent hwpoison pages from being
dumped because hwpoison pages can be marked asynchornously at any time
after the check.  Secondly, and more importantly, the patch introduces a
ref count leak because get_dump_page takes a reference on the page which
is not released.

It also seems that the patch was merged incorrectly because there were
follow up changes not included as well as discussions on how to address
the underlying problem [2]

Therefore revert the original patch.
