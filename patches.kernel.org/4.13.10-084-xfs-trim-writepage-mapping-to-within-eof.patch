Subject: [PATCH] xfs: trim writepage mapping to within eof
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.13.10
Git-commit: 40214d128e07dd21bb07a8ed6a7fe2f911281ab2

commit 40214d128e07dd21bb07a8ed6a7fe2f911281ab2 upstream.

The writeback rework in commit fbcc02561359 ("xfs: Introduce
writeback context for writepages") introduced a subtle change in
behavior with regard to the block mapping used across the
->writepages() sequence. The previous xfs_cluster_write() code would
only flush pages up to EOF at the time of the writepage, thus
ensuring that any pages due to file-extending writes would be
handled on a separate cycle and with a new, updated block mapping.

The updated code establishes a block mapping in xfs_writepage_map()
that could extend beyond EOF if the file has post-eof preallocation.
Because we now use the generic writeback infrastructure and pass the
cached mapping to each writepage call, there is no implicit EOF
limit in place. If eofblocks trimming occurs during ->writepages(),
any post-eof portion of the cached mapping becomes invalid. The
eofblocks code has no means to serialize against writeback because
there are no pages associated with post-eof blocks. Therefore if an
eofblocks trim occurs and is followed by a file-extending buffered
write, not only has the mapping become invalid, but we could end up
writing a page to disk based on the invalid mapping.

Consider the following sequence of events:

- A buffered write creates a delalloc extent and post-eof
  speculative preallocation.
- Writeback starts and on the first writepage cycle, the delalloc
  extent is converted to real blocks (including the post-eof blocks)
  and the mapping is cached.
- The file is closed and xfs_release() trims post-eof blocks. The
  cached writeback mapping is now invalid.
- Another buffered write appends the file with a delalloc extent.
- The concurrent writeback cycle picks up the just written page
  because the writeback range end is LLONG_MAX. xfs_writepage_map()
  attributes it to the (now invalid) cached mapping and writes the
  data to an incorrect location on disk (and where the file offset is
  still backed by a delalloc extent).

This problem is reproduced by xfstests test generic/464, which
triggers racing writes, appends, open/closes and writeback requests.

To address this problem, trim the mapping used during writeback to
within EOF when the mapping is validated. This ensures the mapping
is revalidated for any pages encountered beyond EOF as of the time
the current mapping was cached or last validated.
