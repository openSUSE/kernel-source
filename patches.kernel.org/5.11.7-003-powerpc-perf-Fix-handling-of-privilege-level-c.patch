Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/perf: Fix handling of privilege level checks in perf
 interrupt context
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.7
Git-commit: 5ae5fbd2107959b68ac69a8b75412208663aea88

commit 5ae5fbd2107959b68ac69a8b75412208663aea88 upstream.

Running "perf mem record" in powerpc platforms with selinux enabled
resulted in soft lockup's. Below call-trace was seen in the logs:

The above trace shows that while the CPU was handling a performance
monitor exception, there was a call to security_perf_event_open()
function. In powerpc core-book3s, this function is called from
perf_allow_kernel() check during recording of data address in the
sample via perf_get_data_addr().

Commit da97e18458fb ("perf_event: Add support for LSM and SELinux
checks") introduced security enhancements to perf. As part of this
commit, the new security hook for perf_event_open() was added in all
places where perf paranoid check was previously used. In powerpc
core-book3s code, originally had paranoid checks in
perf_get_data_addr() and power_pmu_bhrb_read(). So
perf_paranoid_kernel() checks were replaced with perf_allow_kernel()
in these PMU helper functions as well.

The intention of paranoid checks in core-book3s was to verify
privilege access before capturing some of the sample data. Along with
paranoid checks, perf_allow_kernel() also does a
security_perf_event_open(). Since these functions are accessed while
recording a sample, we end up calling selinux_perf_event_open() in PMI
context. Some of the security functions use spinlock like
sidtab_sid2str_put(). If a perf interrupt hits under a spin lock and
if we end up in calling selinux hook functions in PMI handler, this
could cause a dead lock.

Since the purpose of this security hook is to control access to
perf_event_open(), it is not right to call this in interrupt context.

The paranoid checks in powerpc core-book3s were done at interrupt time
which is also not correct.

Reference commits:
  Commit cd1231d7035f ("powerpc/perf: Prevent kernel address leak via perf_get_data_addr()")
  Commit bb19af816025 ("powerpc/perf: Prevent kernel address leak to userspace via BHRB buffer")

We only allow creation of events that have already passed the
privilege checks in perf_event_open(). So these paranoid checks are
not needed at event time. As a fix, patch uses
'event->attr.exclude_kernel' check to prevent exposing kernel address
for userspace only sampling.
