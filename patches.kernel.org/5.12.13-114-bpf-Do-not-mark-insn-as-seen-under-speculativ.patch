Subject: [PATCH] bpf: Do not mark insn as seen under speculative path
 verification
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.13
Git-commit: fe9a5ca7e370e613a9a75a13008a3845ea759d6e

[ Upstream commit fe9a5ca7e370e613a9a75a13008a3845ea759d6e ]

... in such circumstances, we do not want to mark the instruction as seen given
the goal is still to jmp-1 rewrite/sanitize dead code, if it is not reachable
from the non-speculative path verification. We do however want to verify it for
safety regardless.

With the patch as-is all the insns that have been marked as seen before the
patch will also be marked as seen after the patch (just with a potentially
different non-zero count). An upcoming patch will also verify paths that are
unreachable in the non-speculative domain, hence this extension is needed.
