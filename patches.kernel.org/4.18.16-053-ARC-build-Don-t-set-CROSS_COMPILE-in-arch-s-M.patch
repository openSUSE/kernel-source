Subject: [PATCH] ARC: build: Don't set CROSS_COMPILE in arch's Makefile
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.16
Git-commit: 40660f1fcee8d524a60b5101538e42b1f39f106d

commit 40660f1fcee8d524a60b5101538e42b1f39f106d upstream.

There's not much sense in doing that because if user or
his build-system didn't set CROSS_COMPILE we still may
very well make incorrect guess.

But as it turned out setting CROSS_COMPILE is not as harmless
as one may think: with recent changes that implemented automatic
discovery of __host__ gcc features unconditional setup of
CROSS_COMPILE leads to failures on execution of "make xxx_defconfig"
with absent cross-compiler, for more info see [1].

Set CROSS_COMPILE as well gets in the way if we want only to build
.dtb's (again with absent cross-compiler which is not really needed
for building .dtb's), see [2].

Note, we had to change LIBGCC assignment type from ":=" to "="
so that is is resolved on its usage, otherwise if it is resolved
at declaration time with missing CROSS_COMPILE we're getting this
error message from host GCC:

| gcc: error: unrecognized command line option -mmedium-calls
| gcc: error: unrecognized command line option -mno-sdata
