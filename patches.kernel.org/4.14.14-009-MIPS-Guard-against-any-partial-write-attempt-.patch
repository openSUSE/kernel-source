Subject: [PATCH] MIPS: Guard against any partial write attempt with
 PTRACE_SETREGSET
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.14
Git-commit: dc24d0edf33c3e15099688b6bbdf7bdc24bf6e91

commit dc24d0edf33c3e15099688b6bbdf7bdc24bf6e91 upstream.

Complement commit d614fd58a283 ("mips/ptrace: Preserve previous
registers for short regset write") and ensure that no partial register
write attempt is made with PTRACE_SETREGSET, as we do not preinitialize
any temporaries used to hold incoming register data and consequently
random data could be written.

It is the responsibility of the caller, such as `ptrace_regset', to
arrange for writes to span whole registers only, so here we only assert
that it has indeed happened.
