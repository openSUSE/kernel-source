Subject: [PATCH] docs: rust: remove spurious item in `expect` list
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.19
Git-commit: b160dc46dd9af4001c802cc9c7d68b6ba58d27c4

commit b160dc46dd9af4001c802cc9c7d68b6ba58d27c4 upstream.

This list started as a "when to prefer `expect`" list, but at some point
during writing I changed it to a "prefer `expect` unless..." one. However,
the first bullet remained, which does not make sense anymore.

Thus remove it. In addition, fix nearby typo.
