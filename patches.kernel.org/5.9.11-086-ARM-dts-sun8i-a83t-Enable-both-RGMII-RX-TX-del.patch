Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: sun8i: a83t: Enable both RGMII RX/TX delay on
 Ethernet PHY
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.11
Git-commit: 57dbe558457bf4042169bc1f334e3b53a8480a1c

[ Upstream commit 57dbe558457bf4042169bc1f334e3b53a8480a1c ]

The Ethernet PHY on the Bananapi M3 and Cubietruck Plus have the RX
and TX delays enabled on the PHY, using pull-ups on the RXDLY and
TXDLY pins.

Fix the phy-mode description to correct reflect this so that the
implementation doesn't reconfigure the delays incorrectly. This
happened with commit bbc4d71d6354 ("net: phy: realtek: fix rtl8211e
rx/tx delay config").
