Subject: [PATCH] rcu: Make need_resched() respond to urgent RCU-QS needs
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.6
Git-commit: 92aa39e9dc77481b90cbef25e547d66cab901496

commit 92aa39e9dc77481b90cbef25e547d66cab901496 upstream.

The per-CPU rcu_dynticks.rcu_urgent_qs variable communicates an urgent
need for an RCU quiescent state from the force-quiescent-state processing
within the grace-period kthread to context switches and to cond_resched().
Unfortunately, such urgent needs are not communicated to need_resched(),
which is sometimes used to decide when to invoke cond_resched(), for
but one example, within the KVM vcpu_run() function.  As of v4.15, this
can result in synchronize_sched() being delayed by up to ten seconds,
which can be problematic, to say nothing of annoying.

This commit therefore checks rcu_dynticks.rcu_urgent_qs from within
rcu_check_callbacks(), which is invoked from the scheduling-clock
interrupt handler.  If the current task is not an idle task and is
not executing in usermode, a context switch is forced, and either way,
the rcu_dynticks.rcu_urgent_qs variable is set to false.  If the current
task is an idle task, then RCU's dyntick-idle code will detect the
quiescent state, so no further action is required.  Similarly, if the
task is executing in usermode, other code in rcu_check_callbacks() and
its called functions will report the corresponding quiescent state.
