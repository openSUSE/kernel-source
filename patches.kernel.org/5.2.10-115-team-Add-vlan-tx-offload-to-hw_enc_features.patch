Subject: [PATCH] team: Add vlan tx offload to hw_enc_features
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.10
Git-commit: 227f2f030e28d8783c3d10ce70ff4ba79cad653f

[ Upstream commit 227f2f030e28d8783c3d10ce70ff4ba79cad653f ]

We should also enable team's vlan tx offload in hw_enc_features,
pass the vlan packets to the slave devices with vlan tci, let the
slave handle vlan tunneling offload implementation.
