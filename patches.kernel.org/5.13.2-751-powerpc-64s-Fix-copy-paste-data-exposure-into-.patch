Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/64s: Fix copy-paste data exposure into newly created
 tasks
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.2
Git-commit: f35d2f249ef05b9671e7898f09ad89aa78f99122

[ Upstream commit f35d2f249ef05b9671e7898f09ad89aa78f99122 ]

copy-paste contains implicit "copy buffer" state that can contain
arbitrary user data (if the user process executes a copy instruction).
This could be snooped by another process if a context switch hits while
the state is live. So cp_abort is executed on context switch to clear
out possible sensitive data and prevent the leak.

cp_abort is done after the low level _switch(), which means it is never
reached by newly created tasks, so they could snoop on this buffer
between their first and second context switch.

Fix this by doing the cp_abort before calling _switch. Add some
comments which should make the issue harder to miss.

Fixes: 07d2a628bc000 ("powerpc/64s: Avoid cpabort in context switch when possible")
