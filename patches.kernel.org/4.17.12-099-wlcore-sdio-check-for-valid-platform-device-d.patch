Subject: [PATCH] wlcore: sdio: check for valid platform device data before
 suspend
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.12
Git-commit: 6e91d48371e79862ea2c05867aaebe4afe55a865

[ Upstream commit 6e91d48371e79862ea2c05867aaebe4afe55a865 ]

the wl pointer can be null In case only wlcore_sdio is probed while
no WiLink module is successfully probed, as in the case of mounting a
wl12xx module while using a device tree file configured with wl18xx
related settings.
In this case the system was crashing in wl1271_suspend() as platform
device data is not set.
Make sure wl the pointer is valid before using it.
