Subject: [PATCH] arm64: neon: Fix function may_use_simd() return error status
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.7
Git-commit: 2fd8eb4ad87104c54800ef3cea498c92eb15c78a

commit 2fd8eb4ad87104c54800ef3cea498c92eb15c78a upstream.

It does not matter if the caller of may_use_simd() migrates to
another cpu after the call, but it is still important that the
kernel_neon_busy percpu instance that is read matches the cpu the
task is running on at the time of the read.

This means that raw_cpu_read() is not sufficient.  kernel_neon_busy
may appear true if the caller migrates during the execution of
raw_cpu_read() and the next task to be scheduled in on the initial
cpu calls kernel_neon_begin().

This patch replaces raw_cpu_read() with this_cpu_read() to protect
against this race.
