Subject: [PATCH] iavf: check for removal state before
 IAVF_FLAG_PF_COMMS_FAILED
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.43
Git-commit: 91896c8acce23d33ed078cffd46a9534b1f82be5

[ Upstream commit 91896c8acce23d33ed078cffd46a9534b1f82be5 ]

In iavf_adminq_task(), if the function can't acquire the
adapter->crit_lock, it checks if the driver is removing. If so, it simply
exits without re-enabling the interrupt. This is done to ensure that the
task stops processing as soon as possible once the driver is being removed.

However, if the IAVF_FLAG_PF_COMMS_FAILED is set, the function checks this
before attempting to acquire the lock. In this case, the function exits
early and re-enables the interrupt. This will happen even if the driver is
already removing.

Avoid this, by moving the check to after the adapter->crit_lock is
acquired. This way, if the driver is removing, we will not re-enable the
interrupt.
