Subject: [PATCH] tcp: fix SO_RCVLOWAT related hangs under mem pressure
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.3
Git-commit: f969dc5a885736842c3511ecdea240fbb02d25d9

[ Upstream commit f969dc5a885736842c3511ecdea240fbb02d25d9 ]

While commit 24adbc1676af ("tcp: fix SO_RCVLOWAT hangs with fat skbs")
fixed an issue vs too small sk_rcvbuf for given sk_rcvlowat constraint,
it missed to address issue caused by memory pressure.

1) If we are under memory pressure and socket receive queue is empty.
First incoming packet is allowed to be queued, after commit
76dfa6082032 ("tcp: allow one skb to be received per socket under memory pressure")

But we do not send EPOLLIN yet, in case tcp_data_ready() sees sk_rcvlowat
is bigger than skb length.

2) Then, when next packet comes, it is dropped, and we directly
call sk->sk_data_ready().

3) If application is using poll(), tcp_poll() will then use
tcp_stream_is_readable() and decide the socket receive queue is
not yet filled, so nothing will happen.

Even when sender retransmits packets, phases 2) & 3) repeat
and flow is effectively frozen, until memory pressure is off.

Fix is to consider tcp_under_memory_pressure() to take care
of global memory pressure or memcg pressure.
