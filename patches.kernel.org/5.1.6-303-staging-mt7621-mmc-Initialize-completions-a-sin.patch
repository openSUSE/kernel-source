Subject: [PATCH] staging: mt7621-mmc: Initialize completions a single time
 during probe
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.6
Git-commit: 7ca8c2c8bbeda2a2a2a9898cd35066bc1dc83836

[ Upstream commit 7ca8c2c8bbeda2a2a2a9898cd35066bc1dc83836 ]

The module was initializing completions whenever it was going to wait on
them, and not when the completion was allocated.  This is incorrect
according to the completion docs:

    Calling init_completion() on the same completion object twice is
    most likely a bug [...]

Re-initialization is also unnecessary because the module never uses
complete_all().  Fix this by only ever initializing the completion a
single time, and log if the completions are not consumed as intended
(this is not a fatal problem, but should not go unnoticed).
