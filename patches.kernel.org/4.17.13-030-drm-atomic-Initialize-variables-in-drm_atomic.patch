Subject: [PATCH] drm/atomic: Initialize variables in
 drm_atomic_helper_async_check() to make gcc happy
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.13
Git-commit: de2d8db395c32d121d02871819444b631f73e0b6

commit de2d8db395c32d121d02871819444b631f73e0b6 upstream.

drm_atomic_helper_async_check() declares the plane, old_plane_state and
new_plane_state variables to iterate over all planes of the atomic
state and make sure only one plane is enabled.

Unfortunately gcc is not smart enough to figure out that the check on
n_planes is enough to guarantee that plane, new_plane_state and
old_plane_state are initialized.

Explicitly initialize those variables to NULL to make gcc happy.
