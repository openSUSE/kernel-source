Subject: [PATCH] scsi: core: Synchronize request queue PM status only on
 successful resume
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.4
Git-commit: 3f7e62bba0003f9c68f599f5997c4647ef5b4f4e

commit 3f7e62bba0003f9c68f599f5997c4647ef5b4f4e upstream.

The commit 356fd2663cff ("scsi: Set request queue runtime PM status back to
active on resume") fixed up the inconsistent RPM status between request
queue and device. However changing request queue RPM status shall be done
only on successful resume, otherwise status may be still inconsistent as
below,

Request queue: RPM_ACTIVE
Device: RPM_SUSPENDED

This ends up soft lockup because requests can be submitted to underlying
devices but those devices and their required resource are not resumed.

For example,

After above inconsistent status happens, IO request can be submitted to UFS
device driver but required resource (like clock) is not resumed yet thus
lead to warning as below call stack,

WARN_ON(hba->clk_gating.state != CLKS_ON);
ufshcd_queuecommand
scsi_dispatch_cmd
scsi_request_fn
__blk_run_queue
cfq_insert_request
__elv_add_request
blk_flush_plug_list
blk_finish_plug
jbd2_journal_commit_transaction
kjournald2

We may see all behind IO requests hang because of no response from storage
host or device and then soft lockup happens in system. In the end, system
may crash in many ways.
