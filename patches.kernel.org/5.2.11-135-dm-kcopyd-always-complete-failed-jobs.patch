Subject: [PATCH] dm kcopyd: always complete failed jobs
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.11
Git-commit: d1fef41465f0e8cae0693fb184caa6bfafb6cd16

commit d1fef41465f0e8cae0693fb184caa6bfafb6cd16 upstream.

This patch fixes a problem in dm-kcopyd that may leave jobs in
complete queue indefinitely in the event of backing storage failure.

This behavior has been observed while running 100% write file fio
workload against an XFS volume created on top of a dm-zoned target
device. If the underlying storage of dm-zoned goes to offline state
under I/O, kcopyd sometimes never issues the end copy callback and
dm-zoned reclaim work hangs indefinitely waiting for that completion.

This behavior was traced down to the error handling code in
process_jobs() function that places the failed job to complete_jobs
queue, but doesn't wake up the job handler. In case of backing device
failure, all outstanding jobs may end up going to complete_jobs queue
via this code path and then stay there forever because there are no
more successful I/O jobs to wake up the job handler.

This patch adds a wake() call to always wake up kcopyd job wait queue
for all I/O jobs that fail before dm_io() gets called for that job.

The patch also sets the write error status in all sub jobs that are
failed because their master job has failed.
