Subject: [PATCH] kfence: avoid passing -g for test
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.22
Git-commit: 2e08ca1802441224f5b7cc6bffbb687f7406de95

commit 2e08ca1802441224f5b7cc6bffbb687f7406de95 upstream.

Nathan reported that when building with GNU as and a version of clang that
defaults to DWARF5:

  $ make -skj"$(nproc)" ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-linux-gnu- \
			LLVM=1 LLVM_IAS=0 O=build \
			mrproper allmodconfig mm/kfence/kfence_test.o
  /tmp/kfence_test-08a0a0.s: Assembler messages:
  /tmp/kfence_test-08a0a0.s:14627: Error: non-constant .uleb128 is not supported
  /tmp/kfence_test-08a0a0.s:14628: Error: non-constant .uleb128 is not supported
  /tmp/kfence_test-08a0a0.s:14632: Error: non-constant .uleb128 is not supported
  /tmp/kfence_test-08a0a0.s:14633: Error: non-constant .uleb128 is not supported
  /tmp/kfence_test-08a0a0.s:14639: Error: non-constant .uleb128 is not supported
  ...

This is because `-g` defaults to the compiler debug info default.  If the
assembler does not support some of the directives used, the above errors
occur.  To fix, remove the explicit passing of `-g`.

All the test wants is that stack traces print valid function names, and
debug info is not required for that.  (I currently cannot recall why I
added the explicit `-g`.)
