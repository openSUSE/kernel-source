Subject: [PATCH] Bluetooth: btqca: Add a short delay before downloading the
 NVM
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.14
Git-commit: 8059ba0bd0e4694e51c2ee6438a77b325f06c0d5

[ Upstream commit 8059ba0bd0e4694e51c2ee6438a77b325f06c0d5 ]

On WCN3990 downloading the NVM sometimes fails with a "TLV response
size mismatch" error:

[  174.949955] Bluetooth: btqca.c:qca_download_firmware() hci0: QCA Downloading qca/crnv21.bin
[  174.958718] Bluetooth: btqca.c:qca_tlv_send_segment() hci0: QCA TLV response size mismatch

It seems the controller needs a short time after downloading the
firmware before it is ready for the NVM. A delay as short as 1 ms
seems sufficient, make it 10 ms just in case. No event is received
during the delay, hence we don't just silently drop an extra event.
