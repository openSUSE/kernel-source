Subject: [PATCH] bonding/802.3ad: fix slave link initialization transition
 states
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.7
Git-commit: 334031219a84b9994594015aab85ed7754c80176

[ Upstream commit 334031219a84b9994594015aab85ed7754c80176 ]

Once in a while, with just the right timing, 802.3ad slaves will fail to
properly initialize, winding up in a weird state, with a partner system
mac address of 00:00:00:00:00:00. This started happening after a fix to
properly track link_failure_count tracking, where an 802.3ad slave that
reported itself as link up in the miimon code, but wasn't able to get a
valid speed/duplex, started getting set to BOND_LINK_FAIL instead of
BOND_LINK_DOWN. That was the proper thing to do for the general "my link
went down" case, but has created a link initialization race that can put
the interface in this odd state.

The simple fix is to instead set the slave link to BOND_LINK_DOWN again,
if the link has never been up (last_link_up == 0), so the link state
doesn't bounce from BOND_LINK_DOWN to BOND_LINK_FAIL -- it hasn't failed
in this case, it simply hasn't been up yet, and this prevents the
unnecessary state change from DOWN to FAIL and getting stuck in an init
failure w/o a partner mac.
