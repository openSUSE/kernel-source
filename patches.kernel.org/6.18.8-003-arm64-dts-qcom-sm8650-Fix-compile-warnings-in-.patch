Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sm8650: Fix compile warnings in USB
 controller node
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.8
Git-commit: 1f6ca557088eb96c8c554f853eb7c60862f8a0a8

[ Upstream commit 1f6ca557088eb96c8c554f853eb7c60862f8a0a8 ]

With W=1, the following error comes up:

Warning (avoid_unnecessary_addr_size): /soc@0/usb@a600000: unnecessary #address-cells/#size-cells without "ranges", "dma-ranges" or child "reg" or "ranges" property

This is because the child node being removed during flattening and moving
to latest bindings.
