Subject: [PATCH] Revert "tcp: avoid the lookup process failing to get sk in
 ehash table"
References: bsc#1012628

[ Upstream commit 81b3ade5d2b98ad6e0a473b0e1e420a801275592 ]

This reverts commit 3f4ca5fafc08881d7a57daa20449d171f2887043.

Commit 3f4ca5fafc08 ("tcp: avoid the lookup process failing to get sk in
ehash table") reversed the order in how a socket is inserted into ehash
to fix an issue that ehash-lookup could fail when reqsk/full sk/twsk are
swapped.  However, it introduced another lookup failure.

The full socket in ehash is allocated from a slab with SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU
and does not have SOCK_RCU_FREE, so the socket could be reused even while
it is being referenced on another CPU doing RCU lookup.

Let's say a socket is reused and inserted into the same hash bucket during
lookup.  After the blamed commit, a new socket is inserted at the end of
the list.  If that happens, we will skip sockets placed after the previous
position of the reused socket, resulting in ehash lookup failure.

As described in Documentation/RCU/rculist_nulls.rst, we should insert a
new socket at the head of the list to avoid such an issue.

This issue, the swap-lookup-failure, and another variant reported in [0]
can all be handled properly by adding a locked ehash lookup suggested by
Eric Dumazet [1].

However, this issue could occur for every packet, thus more likely than
the other two races, so let's revert the change for now.
