Subject: [PATCH] regulator: Fix 'do-nothing' value for regulators without
 suspend state
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.12
Git-commit: 3edd79cf5a44b12dbb13bc320f5788aed6562b36

commit 3edd79cf5a44b12dbb13bc320f5788aed6562b36 upstream.

Some regulators don't have all states defined and in such cases regulator
core should not assume anything. However in current implementation
of of_get_regulation_constraints() DO_NOTHING_IN_SUSPEND enable value was
set only for regulators which had suspend node defined, otherwise the
default 0 value was used, what means DISABLE_IN_SUSPEND. This lead to
broken system suspend/resume on boards, which had simple regulator
constraints definition (without suspend state nodes).

To avoid further mismatches between the default and uninitialized values
of the suspend enabled/disabled states, change the values of the them,
so default '0' means DO_NOTHING_IN_SUSPEND.

Fixes: 72069f9957a1: regulator: leave one item to record whether regulator is enabled
