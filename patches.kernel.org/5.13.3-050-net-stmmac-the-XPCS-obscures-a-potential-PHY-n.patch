Subject: [PATCH] net: stmmac: the XPCS obscures a potential "PHY not found"
 error
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.3
Git-commit: 4751d2aa321f2828d8c5d2f7ce4ed18a01e47f46

[ Upstream commit 4751d2aa321f2828d8c5d2f7ce4ed18a01e47f46 ]

stmmac_mdio_register() has logic to search for PHYs on the MDIO bus and
assign them IRQ lines, as well as to set priv->plat->phy_addr.

If no PHY is found, the "found" variable remains set to 0 and the
function errors out.

After the introduction of commit f213bbe8a9d6 ("net: stmmac: Integrate
it with DesignWare XPCS"), the "found" variable was immediately reused
for searching for a PCS on the same MDIO bus.

This can result in 2 types of potential problems (none of them seems to
be seen on the only Intel system that sets has_xpcs = true, otherwise it
would have been reported):

1. If a PCS is found but a PHY is not, then the code happily exits with
   no error. One might say "yes, but this is not possible, because
   of_mdiobus_register will probe a PHY for all MDIO addresses,
   including for the XPCS, so if an XPCS exists, then a PHY certainly
   exists too". Well, that is not true, see intel_mgbe_common_data():

	/* Ensure mdio bus scan skips intel serdes and pcs-xpcs */
	plat->mdio_bus_data->phy_mask = 1 << INTEL_MGBE_ADHOC_ADDR;
	plat->mdio_bus_data->phy_mask |= 1 << INTEL_MGBE_XPCS_ADDR;

2. A PHY is found but an MDIO device with the XPCS PHY ID isn't, and in
   that case, the error message will be "No PHY found". Confusing.
