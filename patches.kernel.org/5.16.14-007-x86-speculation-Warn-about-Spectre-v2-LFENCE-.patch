Subject: [PATCH] x86/speculation: Warn about Spectre v2 LFENCE mitigation
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.16.14
Git-commit: eafd987d4a82c7bb5aa12f0e3b4f8f3dea93e678

commit eafd987d4a82c7bb5aa12f0e3b4f8f3dea93e678 upstream.

With:

  f8a66d608a3e ("x86,bugs: Unconditionally allow spectre_v2=retpoline,amd")

it became possible to enable the LFENCE "retpoline" on Intel. However,
Intel doesn't recommend it, as it has some weaknesses compared to
retpoline.

Now AMD doesn't recommend it either.

It can still be left available as a cmdline option. It's faster than
retpoline but is weaker in certain scenarios -- particularly SMT, but
even non-SMT may be vulnerable in some cases.

So just unconditionally warn if the user requests it on the cmdline.
