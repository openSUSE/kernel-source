Subject: [PATCH] nvme: Fix cntlid validation when not using NVMEoF
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.14
Git-commit: a89fcca8185633993018dc081d6b021d005e6d0b

[ Upstream commit a89fcca8185633993018dc081d6b021d005e6d0b ]

Commit 1b1031ca63b2 ("nvme: validate cntlid during controller initialisation")
introduced a validation for controllers with duplicate cntlid that runs
on nvme_init_subsystem(). The problem is that the validation relies on
ctrl->cntlid, and this value is assigned (from id_ctrl value) after the
call for nvme_init_subsystem() in nvme_init_identify() for non-fabrics
scenario. That leads to ctrl->cntlid always being 0 in case we have a
physical set of controllers in the same subsystem.

This patch fixes that by loading the discovered cntlid id_ctrl value into
ctrl->cntlid before the subsystem initialization, only for the non-fabrics
case. The patch was tested with emulated nvme devices (qemu) having two
controllers in a single subsystem. Without the patch, we couldn't make
it work failing in the duplicate check; when running with the patch, we
could see the subsystem holding both controllers.

For the fabrics case we see ctrl->cntlid has a more intricate relation
with the admin connect, so we didn't change that.
