Subject: [PATCH] bcache: check ca->alloc_thread initialized before wake up it
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.3
Git-commit: 91af8300d9c1d7c6b6a2fd754109e08d4798b8d8

commit 91af8300d9c1d7c6b6a2fd754109e08d4798b8d8 upstream.

In bcache code, sysfs entries are created before all resources get
allocated, e.g. allocation thread of a cache set.

There is posibility for NULL pointer deference if a resource is accessed
but which is not initialized yet. Indeed Jorg Bornschein catches one on
cache set allocation thread and gets a kernel oops.

The reason for this bug is, when bch_bucket_alloc() is called during
cache set registration and attaching, ca->alloc_thread is not properly
allocated and initialized yet, call wake_up_process() on ca->alloc_thread
triggers NULL pointer deference failure. A simple and fast fix is, before
waking up ca->alloc_thread, checking whether it is allocated, and only
wake up ca->alloc_thread when it is not NULL.
