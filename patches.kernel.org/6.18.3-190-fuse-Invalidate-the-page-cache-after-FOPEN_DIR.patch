Subject: [PATCH] fuse: Invalidate the page cache after FOPEN_DIRECT_IO write
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.3
Git-commit: b359af8275a982a458e8df6c6beab1415be1f795

[ Upstream commit b359af8275a982a458e8df6c6beab1415be1f795 ]

generic_file_direct_write() also does this and has a large
comment about.

Reproducer here is xfstest's generic/209, which is exactly to
have competing DIO write and cached IO read.
