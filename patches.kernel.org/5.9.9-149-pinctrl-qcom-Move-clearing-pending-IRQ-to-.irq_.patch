Subject: [PATCH] pinctrl: qcom: Move clearing pending IRQ to
 .irq_request_resources callback
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.9
Git-commit: 71266d9d39366c9b24b866d811b3facaf837f13f

[ Upstream commit 71266d9d39366c9b24b866d811b3facaf837f13f ]

When GPIOs that are routed to PDC are used as output they can still latch
the IRQ pending at GIC. As a result the spurious IRQ was handled when the
client driver change the direction to input to starts using it as IRQ.

Currently such erroneous latched IRQ are cleared with .irq_enable callback
however if the driver continue to use GPIO as interrupt and invokes
disable_irq() followed by enable_irq() then everytime during enable_irq()
previously latched interrupt gets cleared.

This can make edge IRQs not seen after enable_irq() if they had arrived
after the driver has invoked disable_irq() and were pending at GIC.

Move clearing erroneous IRQ to .irq_request_resources callback as this is
the place where GPIO direction is changed as input and its locked as IRQ.

While at this add a missing check to invoke msm_gpio_irq_clear_unmask()
from .irq_enable callback only when GPIO is not routed to PDC.
