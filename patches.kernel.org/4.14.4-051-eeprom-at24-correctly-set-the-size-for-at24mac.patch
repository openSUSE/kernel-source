Subject: [PATCH] eeprom: at24: correctly set the size for at24mac402
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.4
Git-commit: 5478e478eee3b096b8d998d4ed445da30da2dfbc

commit 5478e478eee3b096b8d998d4ed445da30da2dfbc upstream.

There's an ilog2() expansion in AT24_DEVICE_MAGIC() which rounds down
the actual size of EUI-48 byte array in at24mac402 eeproms to 4 from 6,
making it impossible to read it all.

Fix it by manually adjusting the value in probe().

This patch contains a temporary fix that is suitable for stable
branches. Eventually we'll probably remove the call to ilog2() while
converting the magic values to actual structs.
