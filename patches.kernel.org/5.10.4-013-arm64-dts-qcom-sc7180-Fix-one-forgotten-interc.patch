Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Fix one forgotten interconnect
 reference
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.4
Git-commit: 228813aaa71113d7a12313b87c4905a9d3f9df37

[ Upstream commit 228813aaa71113d7a12313b87c4905a9d3f9df37 ]

In commit e23b1220a246 ("arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Increase the number
of interconnect cells") we missed increasing the cells on one
interconnect.  That's no bueno.  Fix it.

NOTE: it appears that things aren't totally broken without this fix,
but clearly something isn't going to be working right.  If nothing
else, without this fix I see this in the logs:

  OF: /soc@0/mdss@ae00000: could not get #interconnect-cells for /soc@0/interrupt-controller@17a00000
