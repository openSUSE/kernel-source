Subject: [PATCH] arm64: Kconfig: Make ARM64_PSEUDO_NMI depend on BROKEN for
 now
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.6
Git-commit: 96a13f57b946be7a6c10405e4bd780c0b6b6fe63

commit 96a13f57b946be7a6c10405e4bd780c0b6b6fe63 upstream.

Although we merged support for pseudo-nmi using interrupt priority
masking in 5.1, we've since uncovered a number of non-trivial issues
with the implementation. Although there are patches pending to address
these problems, we're facing issues that prevent us from merging them at
this current time:

For now, simply mark this optional feature as BROKEN in the hope that we
can fix things properly in the near future.
