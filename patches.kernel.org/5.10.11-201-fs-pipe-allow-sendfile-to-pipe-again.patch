Subject: [PATCH] fs/pipe: allow sendfile() to pipe again
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.11
Git-commit: f8ad8187c3b536ee2b10502a8340c014204a1af0

commit f8ad8187c3b536ee2b10502a8340c014204a1af0 upstream.

After commit 36e2c7421f02 ("fs: don't allow splice read/write
without explicit ops") sendfile() could no longer send data
from a real file to a pipe, breaking for example certain cgit
setups (e.g. when running behind fcgiwrap), because in this
case cgit will try to do exactly this: sendfile() to a pipe.

Fix this by using iter_file_splice_write for the splice_write
method of pipes, as suggested by Christoph.
