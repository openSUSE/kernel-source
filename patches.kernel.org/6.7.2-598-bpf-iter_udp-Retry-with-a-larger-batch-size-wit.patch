Subject: [PATCH] bpf: iter_udp: Retry with a larger batch size without going
 back to the previous bucket
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.2
Git-commit: 19ca0823f6eaad01d18f664a00550abe912c034c

[ Upstream commit 19ca0823f6eaad01d18f664a00550abe912c034c ]

The current logic is to use a default size 16 to batch the whole bucket.
If it is too small, it will retry with a larger batch size.

The current code accidentally does a state->bucket-- before retrying.
This goes back to retry with the previous bucket which has already
been done. This patch fixed it.

It is hard to create a selftest. I added a WARN_ON(state->bucket < 0),
forced a particular port to be hashed to the first bucket,
created >16 sockets, and observed the for-loop went back
to the "-1" bucket.
