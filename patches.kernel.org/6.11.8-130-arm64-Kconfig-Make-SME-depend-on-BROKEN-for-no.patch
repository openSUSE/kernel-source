Subject: [PATCH] arm64: Kconfig: Make SME depend on BROKEN for now
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.8
Git-commit: 81235ae0c846e1fb46a2c6fe9283fe2b2b24f7dc

commit 81235ae0c846e1fb46a2c6fe9283fe2b2b24f7dc upstream.

Although support for SME was merged in v5.19, we've since uncovered a
number of issues with the implementation, including issues which might
corrupt the FPSIMD/SVE/SME state of arbitrary tasks. While there are
patches to address some of these issues, ongoing review has highlighted
additional functional problems, and more time is necessary to analyse
and fix these.

For now, mark SME as BROKEN in the hope that we can fix things properly
in the near future. As SME is an OPTIONAL part of ARMv9.2+, and there is
very little extant hardware, this should not adversely affect the vast
majority of users.
