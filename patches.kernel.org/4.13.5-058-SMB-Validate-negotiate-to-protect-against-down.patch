Subject: [PATCH] SMB: Validate negotiate (to protect against downgrade) even
 if signing off
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.13.5
Git-commit: 0603c96f3af50e2f9299fa410c224ab1d465e0f9

commit 0603c96f3af50e2f9299fa410c224ab1d465e0f9 upstream.

As long as signing is supported (ie not a guest user connection) and
connection is SMB3 or SMB3.02, then validate negotiate (protect
against man in the middle downgrade attacks).  We had been doing this
only when signing was required, not when signing was just enabled,
but this more closely matches recommended SMB3 behavior and is
better security.  Suggested by Metze.
