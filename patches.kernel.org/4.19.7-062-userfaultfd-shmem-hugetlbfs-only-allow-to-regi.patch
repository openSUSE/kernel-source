Subject: [PATCH] userfaultfd: shmem/hugetlbfs: only allow to register
 VM_MAYWRITE vmas
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.7
Git-commit: 29ec90660d68bbdd69507c1c8b4e33aa299278b1

commit 29ec90660d68bbdd69507c1c8b4e33aa299278b1 upstream.

After the VMA to register the uffd onto is found, check that it has
VM_MAYWRITE set before allowing registration.  This way we inherit all
common code checks before allowing to fill file holes in shmem and
hugetlbfs with UFFDIO_COPY.

The userfaultfd memory model is not applicable for readonly files unless
it's a MAP_PRIVATE.
