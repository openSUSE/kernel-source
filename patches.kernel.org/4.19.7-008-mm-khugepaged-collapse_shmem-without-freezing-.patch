Subject: [PATCH] mm/khugepaged: collapse_shmem() without freezing new_page
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.7
Git-commit: 87c460a0bded56195b5eb497d44709777ef7b415

commit 87c460a0bded56195b5eb497d44709777ef7b415 upstream.

khugepaged's collapse_shmem() does almost all of its work, to assemble
the huge new_page from 512 scattered old pages, with the new_page's
refcount frozen to 0 (and refcounts of all old pages so far also frozen
to 0).  Including shmem_getpage() to read in any which were out on swap,
memory reclaim if necessary to allocate their intermediate pages, and
copying over all the data from old to new.

Imagine the frozen refcount as a spinlock held, but without any lock
debugging to highlight the abuse: it's not good, and under serious load
heads into lockups - speculative getters of the page are not expecting
to spin while khugepaged is rescheduled.

One can get a little further under load by hacking around elsewhere; but
fortunately, freezing the new_page turns out to have been entirely
unnecessary, with no hacks needed elsewhere.

The huge new_page lock is already held throughout, and guards all its
subpages as they are brought one by one into the page cache tree; and
anything reading the data in that page, without the lock, before it has
been marked PageUptodate, would already be in the wrong.  So simply
eliminate the freezing of the new_page.

Each of the old pages remains frozen with refcount 0 after it has been
replaced by a new_page subpage in the page cache tree, until they are
all unfrozen on success or failure: just as before.  They could be
unfrozen sooner, but cause no problem once no longer visible to
find_get_entry(), filemap_map_pages() and other speculative lookups.
