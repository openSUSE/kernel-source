Subject: [PATCH] ring-buffer: Avoid softlockup in ring_buffer_resize()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.6
Git-commit: f6bd2c92488c30ef53b5bd80c52f0a7eee9d545a

[ Upstream commit f6bd2c92488c30ef53b5bd80c52f0a7eee9d545a ]

When user resize all trace ring buffer through file 'buffer_size_kb',
then in ring_buffer_resize(), kernel allocates buffer pages for each
cpu in a loop.

If the kernel preemption model is PREEMPT_NONE and there are many cpus
and there are many buffer pages to be allocated, it may not give up cpu
for a long time and finally cause a softlockup.

To avoid it, call cond_resched() after each cpu buffer allocation.
