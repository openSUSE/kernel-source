Subject: [PATCH] backlight: pwm_bl: Don't use GPIOF_* with gpiod_get_direction
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.12
Git-commit: bb084c0f61d659f0e6d371b096e0e57998f191d6

[ Upstream commit bb084c0f61d659f0e6d371b096e0e57998f191d6 ]

The documentation was wrong, gpiod_get_direction() returns 0/1 instead
of the GPIOF_* flags. The docs were fixed with commit 94fc73094abe47
("gpio: correct docs about return value of gpiod_get_direction"). Now,
fix this user (until a better, system-wide solution is in place).
