Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: SOF: core: Free the firmware trace before calling
 snd_sof_shutdown()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.47
Git-commit: d389dcb3a48cec4f03c16434c0bf98a4c635372a

[ Upstream commit d389dcb3a48cec4f03c16434c0bf98a4c635372a ]

The shutdown is called on reboot/shutdown of the machine.
At this point the firmware tracing cannot be used anymore but in case of
IPC3 it is using and keeping a DMA channel active (dtrace).

For Tiger Lake platforms we have a quirk in place to fix rare reboot issues
when a DMA was active before rebooting the system.
If the tracing is enabled this quirk will be always used and a print
appears on the kernel log which might be misleading or not even correct.

Release the fw tracing before executing the shutdown to make sure that this
known DMA user is cleared away.
