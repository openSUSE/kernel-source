Subject: [PATCH] crypto: testmgr - skip crc32c context test for ahash
 algorithms
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.4
Git-commit: eb5e6730db98fcc4b51148b4a819fa4bf864ae54

commit eb5e6730db98fcc4b51148b4a819fa4bf864ae54 upstream.

Instantiating "cryptd(crc32c)" causes a crypto self-test failure because
the crypto_alloc_shash() in alg_test_crc32c() fails.  This is because
cryptd(crc32c) is an ahash algorithm, not a shash algorithm; so it can
only be accessed through the ahash API, unlike shash algorithms which
can be accessed through both the ahash and shash APIs.

As the test is testing the shash descriptor format which is only
applicable to shash algorithms, skip it for ahash algorithms.

(Note that it's still important to fix crypto self-test failures even
 for weird algorithm instantiations like cryptd(crc32c) that no one
 would really use; in fips_enabled mode unprivileged users can use them
 to panic the kernel, and also they prevent treating a crypto self-test
 failure as a bug when fuzzing the kernel.)
