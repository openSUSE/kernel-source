Subject: [PATCH] drm: document that user-space should force-probe connectors
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.3
Git-commit: a7e2e1c50450c6a0f020b35960edecbe25dde520

[ Upstream commit a7e2e1c50450c6a0f020b35960edecbe25dde520 ]

It seems like we can't have nice things, so let's just document the
disappointing behaviour instead.

The previous version assumed the kernel would perform the probing work
when appropriate, however this is not the case today. Update the
documentation to reflect reality.

v2:

- Improve commit message to explain why this change is made (Pekka)
- Keep the bit about flickering (Daniel)
- Explain when user-space should force-probe, and when it shouldn't (Daniel)
