Subject: [PATCH] KVM: lapic: Fixup LDR on load in x2apic
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.4
Git-commit: 12806ba937382fdfdbad62a399aa2dce65c10fcd

commit 12806ba937382fdfdbad62a399aa2dce65c10fcd upstream.

In x2apic mode the LDR is fixed based on the ID rather
than separately loadable like it was before x2.
When kvm_apic_set_state is called, the base is set, and if
it has the X2APIC_ENABLE flag set then the LDR is calculated;
however that value gets overwritten by the memcpy a few lines
below overwriting it with the value that came from userland.

The symptom is a lack of EOI after loading the state
(e.g. after a QEMU migration) and is due to the EOI bitmap
being wrong due to the incorrect LDR.  This was seen with
a Win2016 guest under Qemu with irqchip=split whose USB mouse
didn't work after a VM migration.

This corresponds to RH bug:
