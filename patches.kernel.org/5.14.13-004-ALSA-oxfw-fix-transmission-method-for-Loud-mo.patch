Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: oxfw: fix transmission method for Loud models based on
 OXFW971
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.13
Git-commit: 64794d6db49730d22f440aef0cf4da98a56a4ea3

[ Upstream commit 64794d6db49730d22f440aef0cf4da98a56a4ea3 ]

Loud Technologies Mackie Onyx 1640i (former model) is identified as
the model which uses OXFW971. The analysis of packet dump shows that
it transfers events in blocking method of IEC 61883-6, however the
default behaviour of ALSA oxfw driver is for non-blocking method.

This commit adds code to detect it assuming that all of loud models
based on OXFW971 have such quirk. It brings no functional change
except for alignment rule of PCM buffer.
