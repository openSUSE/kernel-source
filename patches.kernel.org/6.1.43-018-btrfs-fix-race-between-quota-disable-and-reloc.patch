Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: fix race between quota disable and relocation
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.43
Git-commit: 8a4a0b2a3eaf75ca8854f856ef29690c12b2f531

[ Upstream commit 8a4a0b2a3eaf75ca8854f856ef29690c12b2f531 ]

If we disable quotas while we have a relocation of a metadata block group
that has extents belonging to the quota root, we can cause the relocation
to fail with -ENOENT. This is because relocation builds backref nodes for
extents of the quota root and later needs to walk the backrefs and access
the quota root - however if in between a task disables quotas, it results
in deleting the quota root from the root tree (with btrfs_del_root(),
called from btrfs_quota_disable().

This can be sporadically triggered by test case btrfs/255 from fstests:

  $ ./check btrfs/255

To fix this make the quota disable operation take the cleaner mutex, as
relocation of a block group also takes this mutex. This is also what we
do when deleting a subvolume/snapshot, we take the cleaner mutex in the
cleaner kthread (at cleaner_kthread()) and then we call btrfs_del_root()
at btrfs_drop_snapshot() while under the protection of the cleaner mutex.
