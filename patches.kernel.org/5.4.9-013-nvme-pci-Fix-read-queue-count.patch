Subject: [PATCH] nvme/pci: Fix read queue count
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.9
Git-commit: 7e4c6b9a5d22485acf009b3c3510a370f096dd54

[ Upstream commit 7e4c6b9a5d22485acf009b3c3510a370f096dd54 ]

If nvme.write_queues equals the number of CPUs, the driver had decreased
the number of interrupts available such that there could only be one read
queue even if the controller could support more. Remove the interrupt
count reduction in this case. The driver wouldn't request more IRQs than
it wants queues anyway.
