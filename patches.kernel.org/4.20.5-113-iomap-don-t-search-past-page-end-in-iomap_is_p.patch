Subject: [PATCH] iomap: don't search past page end in
 iomap_is_partially_uptodate
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.5
Git-commit: 3cc31fa65d85610574c0f6a474e89f4c419923d5

[ Upstream commit 3cc31fa65d85610574c0f6a474e89f4c419923d5 ]

iomap_is_partially_uptodate() is intended to check wither blocks within
the selected range of a not-uptodate page are uptodate; if the range we
care about is up to date, it's an optimization.

However, the iomap implementation continues to check all blocks up to
from+count, which is beyond the page, and can even be well beyond the
iop->uptodate bitmap.

I think the worst that will happen is that we may eventually find a zero
bit and return "not partially uptodate" when it would have otherwise
returned true, and skip the optimization.  Still, it's clearly an invalid
memory access that must be fixed.

So: fix this by limiting the search to within the page as is done in the
non-iomap variant, block_is_partially_uptodate().

Zorro noticed thiswhen KASAN went off for 512 byte blocks on a 64k
page system:
