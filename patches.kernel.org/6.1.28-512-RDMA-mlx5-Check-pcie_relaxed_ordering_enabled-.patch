Subject: [PATCH] RDMA/mlx5: Check pcie_relaxed_ordering_enabled() in UMR
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.28
Git-commit: d43b020b0f82c088ef8ff3196ef00575a97d200e

[ Upstream commit d43b020b0f82c088ef8ff3196ef00575a97d200e ]

relaxed_ordering_read HCA capability is set if both the device supports
relaxed ordering (RO) read and RO is set in PCI config space.

RO in PCI config space can change during runtime. This will change the
value of relaxed_ordering_read HCA capability in FW, but the driver will
not see it since it queries the capabilities only once.

This can lead to the following scenario:
1. RO in PCI config space is enabled.
2. User creates MKey without RO.
3. RO in PCI config space is disabled.
   As a result, relaxed_ordering_read HCA capability is turned off in FW
   but remains on in driver copy of the capabilities.
4. User requests to reconfig the MKey with RO via UMR.
5. Driver will try to reconfig the MKey with RO read although it
   shouldn't (as relaxed_ordering_read HCA capability is really off).

To fix this, check pcie_relaxed_ordering_enabled() before setting RO
read in UMR.
