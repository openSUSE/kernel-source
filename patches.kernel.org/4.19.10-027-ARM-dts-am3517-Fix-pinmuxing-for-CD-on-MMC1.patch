Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: am3517: Fix pinmuxing for CD on MMC1
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.10
Git-commit: e7f4ffffa972db4820c23ff9831a6a4f3f6d8cc5

[ Upstream commit e7f4ffffa972db4820c23ff9831a6a4f3f6d8cc5 ]

The MMC1 is active low, not active high.  For some reason,
this worked with different combination of U-Boot and kernels,
but it's supposed to be active low and is currently broken.

Fixes: cfaa856a2510 ("ARM: dts: am3517: Add pinmuxing, CD and
WP for MMC1") #kernel 4.18+
