Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: Handle idling during i915_gem_evict_something busy
 loops
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.14
Git-commit: 955da9d77435acac066139e9d7f7723ce7204a1d

[ Upstream commit 955da9d77435acac066139e9d7f7723ce7204a1d ]

i915_gem_evict_something() is charged with finding a slot within the GTT
that we may reuse. Since our goal is not to stall, we first look for a
slot that only overlaps idle vma. To this end, on the first pass we move
any active vma to the end of the search list. However, we only stopped
moving active vma after we see the first active vma twice. If during the
search, that first active vma completed, we would not notice and keep on
extending the search list.

Closes: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/intel/-/issues/1746
Fixes: 2850748ef876 ("drm/i915: Pull i915_vma_pin under the vm->mutex")
Fixes: b1e3177bd1d8 ("drm/i915: Coordinate i915_active with its own mutex")
