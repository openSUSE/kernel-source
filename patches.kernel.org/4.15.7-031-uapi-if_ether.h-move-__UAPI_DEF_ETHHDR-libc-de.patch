Subject: [PATCH] uapi/if_ether.h: move __UAPI_DEF_ETHHDR libc define
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.7
Git-commit: da360299b6734135a5f66d7db458dcc7801c826a

commit da360299b6734135a5f66d7db458dcc7801c826a upstream.

This fixes a compile problem of some user space applications by not
including linux/libc-compat.h in uapi/if_ether.h.

linux/libc-compat.h checks which "features" the header files, included
from the libc, provide to make the Linux kernel uapi header files only
provide no conflicting structures and enums. If a user application mixes
kernel headers and libc headers it could happen that linux/libc-compat.h
gets included too early where not all other libc headers are included
yet. Then the linux/libc-compat.h would not prevent all the
redefinitions and we run into compile problems.
This patch removes the include of linux/libc-compat.h from
uapi/if_ether.h to fix the recently introduced case, but not all as this
is more or less impossible.

It is no problem to do the check directly in the if_ether.h file and not
in libc-compat.h as this does not need any fancy glibc header detection
as glibc never provided struct ethhdr and should define
__UAPI_DEF_ETHHDR by them self when they will provide this.

The following test program did not compile correctly any more:

#include <linux/if_ether.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <linux/in.h>

int main(void)
{
	return 0;
}
