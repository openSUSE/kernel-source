Subject: [PATCH] bus: mhi: core: Fix check for syserr at power_up
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.3
Git-commit: 6403298c58d4858d93648f553abf0bcbd2dfaca2

commit 6403298c58d4858d93648f553abf0bcbd2dfaca2 upstream.

The check to see if we have reset the device after detecting syserr at
power_up is inverted.  wait_for_event_timeout() returns 0 on failure,
and a positive value on success.  The check is looking for non-zero
as a failure, which is likely to incorrectly cause a device init failure
if syserr was detected at power_up.  Fix this.
