Subject: [PATCH] block: Deny writable memory mapping if block is read-only
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.33
Git-commit: 69baa3a623fd2e58624f24f2f23d46f87b817c93

[ Upstream commit 69baa3a623fd2e58624f24f2f23d46f87b817c93 ]

User should not be able to write block device if it is read-only at
block level (e.g force_ro attribute). This is ensured in the regular
fops write operation (blkdev_write_iter) but not when writing via
user mapping (mmap), allowing user to actually write a read-only
block device via a PROT_WRITE mapping.

Example: This can lead to integrity issue of eMMC boot partition
(e.g mmcblk0boot0) which is read-only by default.

To fix this issue, simply deny shared writable mapping if the block
is readonly.

Note: Block remains writable if switch to read-only is performed
after the initial mapping, but this is expected behavior according
to commit a32e236eb93e ("Partially revert "block: fail op_is_write()
requests to read-only partitions"")'.
