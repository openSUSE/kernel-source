Subject: [PATCH] KVM: SVM: Skip WRMSR fastpath on VM-Exit if next RIP isn't
 valid
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.14
Git-commit: 5c30e8101e8d5d020b1d7119117889756a6ed713

[ Upstream commit 5c30e8101e8d5d020b1d7119117889756a6ed713 ]

Skip the WRMSR fastpath in SVM's VM-Exit handler if the next RIP isn't
valid, e.g. because KVM is running with nrips=false.  SVM must decode and
emulate to skip the WRMSR if the CPU doesn't provide the next RIP.
Getting the instruction bytes to decode the WRMSR requires reading guest
memory, which in turn means dereferencing memslots, and that isn't safe
because KVM doesn't hold SRCU when the fastpath runs.

Don't bother trying to enable the fastpath for this case, e.g. by doing
only the WRMSR and leaving the "skip" until later.  NRIPS is supported on
all modern CPUs (KVM has considered making it mandatory), and the next
RIP will be valid the vast, vast majority of the time.
