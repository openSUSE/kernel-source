Subject: [PATCH] x86/pm: Add enumeration check before spec MSRs save/restore
 setup
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.11
Git-commit: 50bcceb7724e471d9b591803889df45dcbb584bc

commit 50bcceb7724e471d9b591803889df45dcbb584bc upstream.

pm_save_spec_msr() keeps a list of all the MSRs which _might_ need
to be saved and restored at hibernate and resume. However, it has
zero awareness of CPU support for these MSRs. It mostly works by
unconditionally attempting to manipulate these MSRs and relying on
rdmsrl_safe() being able to handle a #GP on CPUs where the support is
unavailable.

However, it's possible for reads (RDMSR) to be supported for a given MSR
while writes (WRMSR) are not. In this case, msr_build_context() sees
a successful read (RDMSR) and marks the MSR as valid. Then, later, a
write (WRMSR) fails, producing a nasty (but harmless) error message.
This causes restore_processor_state() to try and restore it, but writing
this MSR is not allowed on the Intel Atom N2600 leading to:

  unchecked MSR access error: WRMSR to 0x122 (tried to write 0x0000000000000002) \
     at rIP: 0xffffffff8b07a574 (native_write_msr+0x4/0x20)
  Call Trace:
   <TASK>
   restore_processor_state
   x86_acpi_suspend_lowlevel
   acpi_suspend_enter
   suspend_devices_and_enter
   pm_suspend.cold

   ? up_read
   ? lock_is_held_type
   ? asm_exc_page_fault
   ? lockdep_hardirqs_on
   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe

To fix this, add the corresponding X86_FEATURE bit for each MSR.  Avoid
trying to manipulate the MSR when the feature bit is clear. This
required adding a X86_FEATURE bit for MSRs that do not have one already,
but it's a small price to pay.

  [ bp: Move struct msr_enumeration inside the only function that uses it. ]
