Subject: [PATCH] tpm: st33zp24: fix potential buffer overruns caused by bit
 glitches on the bus
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.8
Git-commit: 6d24cd186d9fead3722108dec1b1c993354645ff

commit 6d24cd186d9fead3722108dec1b1c993354645ff upstream.

Discrete TPMs are often connected over slow serial buses which, on
some platforms, can have glitches causing bit flips.  In all the
driver _recv() functions, we need to use a u32 to unmarshal the
response size, otherwise a bit flip of the 31st bit would cause the
expected variable to go negative, which would then try to read a huge
amount of data.  Also sanity check that the expected amount of data is
large enough for the TPM header.
