Subject: [PATCH] bus: mhi: core: Remove double locking from
 mhi_driver_remove()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.4
Git-commit: 9b627c25e70816a5e1dca940444b5029065b4d60

[ Upstream commit 9b627c25e70816a5e1dca940444b5029065b4d60 ]

There is double acquisition of the pm_lock from mhi_driver_remove()
function. Remove the read_lock_bh/read_unlock_bh calls for pm_lock
taken during a call to mhi_device_put() as the lock is acquired
within the function already. This will help avoid a potential
kernel panic.

Fixes: 189ff97cca53 ("bus: mhi: core: Add support for data transfer")
