Subject: [PATCH] tee: allow a driver to allocate a tee_device without a pool
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.58
Git-commit: 6dbcd5a9ab6cb6644e7d728521da1c9035ec7235

[ Upstream commit 6dbcd5a9ab6cb6644e7d728521da1c9035ec7235 ]

A TEE driver doesn't always need to provide a pool if it doesn't
support memory sharing ioctls and can allocate memory for TEE
messages in another way. Although this is mentioned in the
documentation for tee_device_alloc(), it is not handled correctly.
