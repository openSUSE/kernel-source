Subject: [PATCH] perf/x86/intel: Fix NULL event dereference crash in
 handle_pmi_common()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.2
Git-commit: 9415f749d34b926b9e4853da1462f4d941f89a0d

[ Upstream commit 9415f749d34b926b9e4853da1462f4d941f89a0d ]

handle_pmi_common() may observe an active bit set in cpuc->active_mask
while the corresponding cpuc->events[] entry has already been cleared,
which leads to a NULL pointer dereference.

This can happen when interrupt throttling stops all events in a group
while PEBS processing is still in progress. perf_event_overflow() can
trigger perf_event_throttle_group(), which stops the group and clears
the cpuc->events[] entry, but the active bit may still be set when
handle_pmi_common() iterates over the events.

The following recent fix:

  7e772a93eb61 ("perf/x86: Fix NULL event access and potential PEBS record loss")

moved the cpuc->events[] clearing from x86_pmu_stop() to x86_pmu_del() and
relied on cpuc->active_mask/pebs_enabled checks. However,
handle_pmi_common() can still encounter a NULL cpuc->events[] entry
despite the active bit being set.

Add an explicit NULL check on the event pointer before using it,
to cover this legitimate scenario and avoid the NULL dereference crash.
