Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: Default to not allowing emulation retry in
 kvm_mmu_page_fault
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

commit 472faffacd9032164f611f56329d0025ddca55b5 upstream.

Effectively force kvm_mmu_page_fault() to opt-in to allowing retry to
make it more obvious when and why it allows emulation to be retried.
Previously this approach was less convenient due to retry and
re-execute behavior being controlled by separate flags that were also
inverted in their implementations (opt-in versus opt-out).
