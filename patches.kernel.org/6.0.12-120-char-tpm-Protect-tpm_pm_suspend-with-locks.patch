Subject: [PATCH] char: tpm: Protect tpm_pm_suspend with locks
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.12
Git-commit: 23393c6461422df5bf8084a086ada9a7e17dc2ba

commit 23393c6461422df5bf8084a086ada9a7e17dc2ba upstream.

Currently tpm transactions are executed unconditionally in
tpm_pm_suspend() function, which may lead to races with other tpm
accessors in the system.

Specifically, the hw_random tpm driver makes use of tpm_get_random(),
and this function is called in a loop from a kthread, which means it's
not frozen alongside userspace, and so can race with the work done
during system suspend:

  tpm tpm0: tpm_transmit: tpm_recv: error -52
  tpm tpm0: invalid TPM_STS.x 0xff, dumping stack for forensics
  CPU: 0 PID: 1 Comm: init Not tainted 6.1.0-rc5+ #135
  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 1.16.0-20220807_005459-localhost 04/01/2014
  Call Trace:
   tpm_tis_status.cold+0x19/0x20
   tpm_transmit+0x13b/0x390
   tpm_transmit_cmd+0x20/0x80
   tpm1_pm_suspend+0xa6/0x110
   tpm_pm_suspend+0x53/0x80
   __pnp_bus_suspend+0x35/0xe0
   __device_suspend+0x10f/0x350

Fix this by calling tpm_try_get_ops(), which itself is a wrapper around
tpm_chip_start(), but takes the appropriate mutex.
