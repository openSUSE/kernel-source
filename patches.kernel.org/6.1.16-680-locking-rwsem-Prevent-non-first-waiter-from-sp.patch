Subject: [PATCH] locking/rwsem: Prevent non-first waiter from spinning in
 down_write() slowpath
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: b613c7f31476c44316bfac1af7cac714b7d6bef9

commit b613c7f31476c44316bfac1af7cac714b7d6bef9 upstream.

A non-first waiter can potentially spin in the for loop of
rwsem_down_write_slowpath() without sleeping but fail to acquire the
lock even if the rwsem is free if the following sequence happens:

  Non-first RT waiter    First waiter      Lock holder
  -------------------    ------------      -----------
  Acquire wait_lock
  rwsem_try_write_lock():
    Set handoff bit if RT or
      wait too long
    Set waiter->handoff_set
  Release wait_lock
                         Acquire wait_lock
                         Inherit waiter->handoff_set
                         Release wait_lock
					   Clear owner
                                           Release lock
  if (waiter.handoff_set) {
    rwsem_spin_on_owner(();
    if (OWNER_NULL)
      goto trylock_again;
  }
  trylock_again:
  Acquire wait_lock
  rwsem_try_write_lock():
     if (first->handoff_set && (waiter != first))
	return false;
  Release wait_lock

A non-first waiter cannot really acquire the rwsem even if it mistakenly
believes that it can spin on OWNER_NULL value. If that waiter happens
to be an RT task running on the same CPU as the first waiter, it can
block the first waiter from acquiring the rwsem leading to live lock.
Fix this problem by making sure that a non-first waiter cannot spin in
the slowpath loop without sleeping.
