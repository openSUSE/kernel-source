Subject: [PATCH] bonding: fix arp_validate toggling in active-backup mode
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.3
Git-commit: a9b8a2b39ce65df45687cf9ef648885c2a99fe75

[ Upstream commit a9b8a2b39ce65df45687cf9ef648885c2a99fe75 ]

There's currently a problem with toggling arp_validate on and off with an
active-backup bond. At the moment, you can start up a bond, like so:

modprobe bonding mode=1 arp_interval=100 arp_validate=0 arp_ip_targets=192.168.1.1
ip link set bond0 down
echo "ens4f0" > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/slaves
echo "ens4f1" > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/slaves
ip link set bond0 up
ip addr add 192.168.1.2/24 dev bond0

Pings to 192.168.1.1 work just fine. Now turn on arp_validate:

echo 1 > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/arp_validate

Pings to 192.168.1.1 continue to work just fine. Now when you go to turn
arp_validate off again, the link falls flat on it's face:

echo 0 > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/arp_validate
dmesg
...
[133191.911987] bond0: Setting arp_validate to none (0)
[133194.257793] bond0: bond_should_notify_peers: slave ens4f0
[133194.258031] bond0: link status definitely down for interface ens4f0, disabling it
[133194.259000] bond0: making interface ens4f1 the new active one
[133197.330130] bond0: link status definitely down for interface ens4f1, disabling it
[133197.331191] bond0: now running without any active interface!

The problem lies in bond_options.c, where passing in arp_validate=0
results in bond->recv_probe getting set to NULL. This flies directly in
the face of commit 3fe68df97c7f, which says we need to set recv_probe =
bond_arp_recv, even if we're not using arp_validate. Said commit fixed
this in bond_option_arp_interval_set, but missed that we can get to that
same state in bond_option_arp_validate_set as well.

One solution would be to universally set recv_probe = bond_arp_recv here
as well, but I don't think bond_option_arp_validate_set has any business
touching recv_probe at all, and that should be left to the arp_interval
code, so we can just make things much tidier here.

Fixes: 3fe68df97c7f ("bonding: always set recv_probe to bond_arp_rcv in arp monitor")
