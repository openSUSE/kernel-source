Subject: [PATCH] batman-adv: Hold rtnl lock during MTU update via netlink
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.50
Git-commit: 987aae75fc1041072941ffb622b45ce2359a99b9

commit 987aae75fc1041072941ffb622b45ce2359a99b9 upstream.

The automatic recalculation of the maximum allowed MTU is usually triggered
by code sections which are already rtnl lock protected by callers outside
of batman-adv. But when the fragmentation setting is changed via
batman-adv's own batadv genl family, then the rtnl lock is not yet taken.

But dev_set_mtu requires that the caller holds the rtnl lock because it
uses netdevice notifiers. And this code will then fail the check for this
lock:

  RTNL: assertion failed at net/core/dev.c (1953)
