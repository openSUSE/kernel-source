Subject: [PATCH] usb-storage: Add compatibility quirk flags for G-Technologies
 G-Drive
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.2
Git-commit: ca7d9515d0e6825351ce106066cea1f60e40b1c8

commit ca7d9515d0e6825351ce106066cea1f60e40b1c8 upstream.

The "G-Drive" (sold by G-Technology) external USB 3.0 drive
 hangs on write access under UAS and usb-storage:

The proposed patch adds compatibility quirks. Because the drive requires two
quirks (one to work with UAS, and another to work with usb-storage), adding this
under unusual_devs.h and not just unusual_uas.h so kernels compiled without UAS
receive the quirk. With the patch, the drive works reliably on UAS and usb-
storage.
(tested on NEC Corporation uPD720200 USB 3.0 host controller).
