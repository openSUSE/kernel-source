Subject: [PATCH] MIPS: Fix CONFIG_CMDLINE handling
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.15
Git-commit: 951d223c6c16ed5d2a71a4d1f13c1e65d6882156

commit 951d223c6c16ed5d2a71a4d1f13c1e65d6882156 upstream.

Commit 8ce355cf2e38 ("MIPS: Setup boot_command_line before
plat_mem_setup") fixed a problem for systems which have
CONFIG_CMDLINE_BOOL=y & use a DT with a chosen node that has either no
bootargs property or an empty one. In this configuration
early_init_dt_scan_chosen() copies CONFIG_CMDLINE into
boot_command_line, but the MIPS code doesn't know this so it appends
CONFIG_CMDLINE (via builtin_cmdline) to boot_command_line again. The
result is that boot_command_line contains the arguments from
CONFIG_CMDLINE twice.

That commit took the approach of simply setting up boot_command_line
from the MIPS code before early_init_dt_scan_chosen() runs, causing it
not to copy CONFIG_CMDLINE to boot_command_line if a chosen node with no
bootargs property is found.

Unfortunately this is problematic for systems which do have a non-empty
bootargs property & CONFIG_CMDLINE_BOOL=y. There
early_init_dt_scan_chosen() will overwrite boot_command_line with the
arguments from DT, which means we lose those from CONFIG_CMDLINE
entirely. This breaks CONFIG_MIPS_CMDLINE_DTB_EXTEND. If we have
CONFIG_MIPS_CMDLINE_FROM_BOOTLOADER or
CONFIG_MIPS_CMDLINE_BUILTIN_EXTEND selected and the DT has a bootargs
property which we should ignore, it will instead be honoured breaking
those configurations too.

Fix this by reverting commit 8ce355cf2e38 ("MIPS: Setup
boot_command_line before plat_mem_setup") to restore the former
behaviour, and fixing the CONFIG_CMDLINE duplication issue by
initializing boot_command_line to a non-empty string that
early_init_dt_scan_chosen() will not overwrite with CONFIG_CMDLINE.

This is a little ugly, but cleanup in this area is on its way. In the
meantime this is at least easy to backport & contains the ugliness
within arch/mips/.
