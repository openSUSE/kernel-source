Subject: [PATCH] nfs4_setup_readdir(): insufficient locking for
 ->d_parent->d_inode dereferencing
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.8
Git-commit: a890a2e339b929dbd843328f9a92a1625404fe63

[ Upstream commit a890a2e339b929dbd843328f9a92a1625404fe63 ]

Theoretically it's an oopsable race, but I don't believe one can manage
to hit it on real hardware; might become doable on a KVM, but it still
won't be easy to attack.

Anyway, it's easy to deal with - since xdr_encode_hyper() is just a call of
put_unaligned_be64(), we can put that under ->d_lock and be done with that.
