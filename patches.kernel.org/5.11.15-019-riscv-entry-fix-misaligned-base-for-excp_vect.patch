Subject: [PATCH] riscv,entry: fix misaligned base for excp_vect_table
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.15
Git-commit: ac8d0b901f0033b783156ab2dc1a0e73ec42409b

[ Upstream commit ac8d0b901f0033b783156ab2dc1a0e73ec42409b ]

In RV64, the size of each entry in excp_vect_table is 8 bytes. If the
base of the table is not 8-byte aligned, loading an entry in the table
will raise a misaligned exception. Although such exception will be
handled by opensbi/bbl, this still causes performance degradation.
