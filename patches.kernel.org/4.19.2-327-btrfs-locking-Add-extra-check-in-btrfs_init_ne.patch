Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: locking: Add extra check in btrfs_init_new_buffer() to
 avoid deadlock

commit b72c3aba09a53fc7c1824250d71180ca154517a7 upstream.

[BUG]
For certain crafted image, whose csum root leaf has missing backref, if
we try to trigger write with data csum, it could cause deadlock with the
following kernel WARN_ON():

  WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 41 at fs/btrfs/locking.c:230 btrfs_tree_lock+0x3e2/0x400

[CAUSE]
That crafted image has missing backref for csum tree root leaf.  And
when we try to allocate new tree block, since there is no
EXTENT/METADATA_ITEM for csum tree root, btrfs consider it's free slot
and use it.

The extent tree of the image looks like:

  Normal image                      |       This fuzzed image
  ----------------------------------+--------------------------------
  BG 29360128                       | BG 29360128
   One empty slot                   |  One empty slot
  29364224: backref to UUID tree    | 29364224: backref to UUID tree
   Two empty slots                  |  Two empty slots
  29376512: backref to CSUM tree    |  One empty slot (bad type) <<<
  29380608: backref to D_RELOC tree | 29380608: backref to D_RELOC tree
  ...                               | ...

Since bytenr 29376512 has no METADATA/EXTENT_ITEM, when btrfs try to
alloc tree block, it's an valid slot for btrfs.

And for finish_ordered_write, when we need to insert csum, we try to CoW
csum tree root.

By accident, empty slots at bytenr BG_OFFSET, BG_OFFSET + 8K,
BG_OFFSET + 12K is already used by tree block COW for other trees, the
next empty slot is BG_OFFSET + 16K, which should be the backref for CSUM
tree.

But due to the bad type, btrfs can recognize it and still consider it as
an empty slot, and will try to use it for csum tree CoW.

Then in the following call trace, we will try to lock the new tree
block, which turns out to be the old csum tree root which is already
locked:

btrfs_search_slot() called on csum tree root, which is at 29376512
|- btrfs_cow_block()
   |- btrfs_set_lock_block()
   |  |- Now locks tree block 29376512 (old csum tree root)
   |- __btrfs_cow_block()
      |- btrfs_alloc_tree_block()
         |- btrfs_reserve_extent()
            | Now it returns tree block 29376512, which extent tree
            | shows its empty slot, but it's already hold by csum tree
            |- btrfs_init_new_buffer()
               |- btrfs_tree_lock()
                  | Triggers WARN_ON(eb->lock_owner == current->pid)
                  |- wait_event()
                     Wait lock owner to release the lock, but it's
                     locked by ourself, so it will deadlock

[FIX]
This patch will do the lock_owner and current->pid check at
btrfs_init_new_buffer().
So above deadlock can be avoided.

Since such problem can only happen in crafted image, we will still
trigger kernel warning for later aborted transaction, but with a little
more meaningful warning message.
