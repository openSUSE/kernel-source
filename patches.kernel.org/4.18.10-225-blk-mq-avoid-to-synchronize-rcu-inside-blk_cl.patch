Subject: [PATCH] blk-mq: avoid to synchronize rcu inside blk_cleanup_queue()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.10
Git-commit: 1311326cf4755c7ffefd20f576144ecf46d9906b

[ Upstream commit 1311326cf4755c7ffefd20f576144ecf46d9906b ]

SCSI probing may synchronously create and destroy a lot of request_queues
for non-existent devices. Any synchronize_rcu() in queue creation or
destroy path may introduce long latency during booting, see detailed
description in comment of blk_register_queue().

This patch removes one synchronize_rcu() inside blk_cleanup_queue()
for this case, commit c2856ae2f315d75(blk-mq: quiesce queue before freeing queue)
needs synchronize_rcu() for implementing blk_mq_quiesce_queue(), but
when queue isn't initialized, it isn't necessary to do that since
only pass-through requests are involved, no original issue in
scsi_execute() at all.

Without this patch and previous one, it may take more 20+ seconds for
virtio-scsi to complete disk probe. With the two patches, the time becomes
less than 100ms.
