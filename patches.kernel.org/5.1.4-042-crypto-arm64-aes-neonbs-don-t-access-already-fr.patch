Subject: [PATCH] crypto: arm64/aes-neonbs - don't access already-freed walk.iv
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.4
Git-commit: 4a8108b70508df0b6c4ffa4a3974dab93dcbe851

commit 4a8108b70508df0b6c4ffa4a3974dab93dcbe851 upstream.

If the user-provided IV needs to be aligned to the algorithm's
alignmask, then skcipher_walk_virt() copies the IV into a new aligned
buffer walk.iv.  But skcipher_walk_virt() can fail afterwards, and then
if the caller unconditionally accesses walk.iv, it's a use-after-free.

xts-aes-neonbs doesn't set an alignmask, so currently it isn't affected
by this despite unconditionally accessing walk.iv.  However this is more
subtle than desired, and unconditionally accessing walk.iv has caused a
real problem in other algorithms.  Thus, update xts-aes-neonbs to start
checking the return value of skcipher_walk_virt().
