Subject: [PATCH] PM: ACPI: PCI: Drop acpi_pm_set_bridge_wakeup()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.4
Git-commit: 7482c5cb90e5a7f9e9e12dd154d405e0219656e3

commit 7482c5cb90e5a7f9e9e12dd154d405e0219656e3 upstream.

The idea behind acpi_pm_set_bridge_wakeup() was to allow bridges to
be reference counted for wakeup enabling, because they may be enabled
to signal wakeup on behalf of their subordinate devices and that
may happen for multiple times in a row, whereas for the other devices
it only makes sense to enable wakeup signaling once.

However, this becomes problematic if the bridge itself is suspended,
because it is treated as a "regular" device in that case and the
reference counting doesn't work.

For instance, suppose that there are two devices below a bridge and
they both can signal wakeup.  Every time one of them is suspended,
wakeup signaling is enabled for the bridge, so when they both have
been suspended, the bridge's wakeup reference counter value is 2.

Say that the bridge is suspended subsequently and acpi_pci_wakeup()
is called for it.  Because the bridge can signal wakeup, that
function will invoke acpi_pm_set_device_wakeup() to configure it
and __acpi_pm_set_device_wakeup() will be called with the last
argument equal to 1.  This causes __acpi_device_wakeup_enable()
invoked by it to omit the reference counting, because the reference
counter of the target device (the bridge) is 2 at that time.

Now say that the bridge resumes and one of the device below it
resumes too, so the bridge's reference counter becomes 0 and
wakeup signaling is disabled for it, but there is still the other
suspended device which may need the bridge to signal wakeup on its
behalf and that is not going to work.

To address this scenario, use wakeup enable reference counting for
all devices, not just for bridges, so drop the last argument from
__acpi_device_wakeup_enable() and __acpi_pm_set_device_wakeup(),
which causes acpi_pm_set_device_wakeup() and
acpi_pm_set_bridge_wakeup() to become identical, so drop the latter
and use the former instead of it everywhere.
