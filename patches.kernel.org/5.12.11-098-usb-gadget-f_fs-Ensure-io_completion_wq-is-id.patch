Subject: [PATCH] usb: gadget: f_fs: Ensure io_completion_wq is idle during
 unbind
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.11
Git-commit: 6fc1db5e6211e30fbb1cee8d7925d79d4ed2ae14

commit 6fc1db5e6211e30fbb1cee8d7925d79d4ed2ae14 upstream.

During unbind, ffs_func_eps_disable() will be executed, resulting in
completion callbacks for any pending USB requests.  When using AIO,
irrespective of the completion status, io_data work is queued to
io_completion_wq to evaluate and handle the completed requests.  Since
work runs asynchronously to the unbind() routine, there can be a
scenario where the work runs after the USB gadget has been fully
removed, resulting in accessing of a resource which has been already
freed. (i.e. usb_ep_free_request() accessing the USB ep structure)

Explicitly drain the io_completion_wq, instead of relying on the
destroy_workqueue() (in ffs_data_put()) to make sure no pending
completion work items are running.
