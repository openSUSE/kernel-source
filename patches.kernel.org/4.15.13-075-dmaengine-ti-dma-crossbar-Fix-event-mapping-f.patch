Subject: [PATCH] dmaengine: ti-dma-crossbar: Fix event mapping for
 TPCC_EVT_MUX_60_63
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.13
Git-commit: d087f15786021a9605b20f4c678312510be4cac1

[ Upstream commit d087f15786021a9605b20f4c678312510be4cac1 ]

Register layout of a typical TPCC_EVT_MUX_M_N register is such that the
lowest numbered event is at the lowest byte address and highest numbered
event at highest byte address. But TPCC_EVT_MUX_60_63 register layout is
different,  in that the lowest numbered event is at the highest address
and highest numbered event is at the lowest address. Therefore, modify
ti_am335x_xbar_write() to handle TPCC_EVT_MUX_60_63 register
accordingly.
