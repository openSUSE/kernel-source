Subject: [PATCH] media: saa7164: Fix driver name in debug output
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.12
Git-commit: 0cc4655cb57af0b7e105d075c4f83f8046efafe7

[ Upstream commit 0cc4655cb57af0b7e105d075c4f83f8046efafe7 ]

This issue was reported by a user who downloaded a corrupt saa7164
firmware, then went looking for a valid xc5000 firmware to fix the
error displayed...but the device in question has no xc5000, thus after
much effort, the wild goose chase eventually led to a support call.

The xc5000 has nothing to do with saa7164 (as far as I can tell),
so replace the string with saa7164 as well as give a meaningful
hint on the firmware mismatch.
