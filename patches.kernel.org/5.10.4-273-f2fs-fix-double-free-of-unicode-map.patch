Subject: [PATCH] f2fs: fix double free of unicode map
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.4
Git-commit: 89ff6005039a878afac87889fee748fa3f957c3a

[ Upstream commit 89ff6005039a878afac87889fee748fa3f957c3a ]

In case of retrying fill_super with skip_recovery,
s_encoding for casefold would not be loaded again even though it's
already been freed because it's not NULL.
Set NULL after free to prevent double freeing when unmount.

Fixes: eca4873ee1b6 ("f2fs: Use generic casefolding support")
