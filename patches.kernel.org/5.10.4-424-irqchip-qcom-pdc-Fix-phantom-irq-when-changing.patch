Subject: [PATCH] irqchip/qcom-pdc: Fix phantom irq when changing between
 rising/falling
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.4
Git-commit: 2f5fbc4305d07725bfebaedb09e57271315691ef

[ Upstream commit 2f5fbc4305d07725bfebaedb09e57271315691ef ]

We have a problem if we use gpio-keys and configure wakeups such that
we only want one edge to wake us up.  AKA:
  wakeup-event-action = <EV_ACT_DEASSERTED>;
  wakeup-source;

Specifically we end up with a phantom interrupt that blocks suspend if
the line was already high and we want wakeups on rising edges (AKA we
want the GPIO to go low and then high again before we wake up).  The
opposite is also problematic.

Specifically, here's what's happening today:
1. Normally, gpio-keys configures to look for both edges.  Due to the
   current workaround introduced in commit c3c0c2e18d94 ("pinctrl:
   qcom: Handle broken/missing PDC dual edge IRQs on sc7180"), if the
   line was high we'd configure for falling edges.
2. At suspend time, we change to look for rising edges.
3. After qcom_pdc_gic_set_type() runs, we get a phantom interrupt.

We can solve this by just clearing the phantom interrupt.

NOTE: it is possible that this could cause problems for a client with
very specific needs, but there's not much we can do with this
hardware.  As an example, let's say the interrupt signal is currently
high and the client is looking for falling edges.  The client now
changes to look for rising edges.  The client could possibly expect
that if the line has a short pulse low (and back high) that it would
always be detected.  Specifically no matter when the pulse happened,
it should either have tripped the (old) falling edge trigger or the
(new) rising edge trigger.  We will simply not trip it.  We could
narrow down the race a bit by polling our parent before changing
types, but no matter what we do there will still be a period of time
where we can't tell the difference between a real transition (or more
than one transition) and the phantom.
