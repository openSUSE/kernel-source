Subject: [PATCH] ext4: fix reserved space counter leakage
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.10
Git-commit: 6fed83957f21eff11c8496e9f24253b03d2bc1dc

commit 6fed83957f21eff11c8496e9f24253b03d2bc1dc upstream.

When ext4_insert_delayed block receives and recovers from an error from
ext4_es_insert_delayed_block(), e.g., ENOMEM, it does not release the
space it has reserved for that block insertion as it should. One effect
of this bug is that s_dirtyclusters_counter is not decremented and
remains incorrectly elevated until the file system has been unmounted.
This can result in premature ENOSPC returns and apparent loss of free
space.

Another effect of this bug is that
/sys/fs/ext4/<dev>/delayed_allocation_blocks can remain non-zero even
after syncfs has been executed on the filesystem.

Besides, add check for s_dirtyclusters_counter when inode is going to be
evicted and freed. s_dirtyclusters_counter can still keep non-zero until
inode is written back in .evict_inode(), and thus the check is delayed
to .destroy_inode().
