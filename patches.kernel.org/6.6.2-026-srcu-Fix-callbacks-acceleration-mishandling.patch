Subject: [PATCH] srcu: Fix callbacks acceleration mishandling
References: bsc#1012628

[ Upstream commit 4a8e65b0c348e42107c64381e692e282900be361 ]

SRCU callbacks acceleration might fail if the preceding callbacks
advance also fails. This can happen when the following steps are met:

1) The RCU_WAIT_TAIL segment has callbacks (say for gp_num 8) and the
   RCU_NEXT_READY_TAIL also has callbacks (say for gp_num 12).

2) The grace period for RCU_WAIT_TAIL is observed as started but not yet
   completed so rcu_seq_current() returns 4 + SRCU_STATE_SCAN1 = 5.

3) This value is passed to rcu_segcblist_advance() which can't move
   any segment forward and fails.

4) srcu_gp_start_if_needed() still proceeds with callback acceleration.
   But then the call to rcu_seq_snap() observes the grace period for the
   RCU_WAIT_TAIL segment (gp_num 8) as completed and the subsequent one
   for the RCU_NEXT_READY_TAIL segment as started
   (ie: 8 + SRCU_STATE_SCAN1 = 9) so it returns a snapshot of the
   next grace period, which is 16.

5) The value of 16 is passed to rcu_segcblist_accelerate() but the
   freshly enqueued callback in RCU_NEXT_TAIL can't move to
   RCU_NEXT_READY_TAIL which already has callbacks for a previous grace
   period (gp_num = 12). So acceleration fails.

6) Note in all these steps, srcu_invoke_callbacks() hadn't had a chance
   to run srcu_invoke_callbacks().

Then some very bad outcome may happen if the following happens:

7) Some other CPU races and starts the grace period number 16 before the
   CPU handling previous steps had a chance. Therefore srcu_gp_start()
   isn't called on the latter sdp to fix the acceleration leak from
   previous steps with a new pair of call to advance/accelerate.

8) The grace period 16 completes and srcu_invoke_callbacks() is finally
   called. All the callbacks from previous grace periods (8 and 12) are
   correctly advanced and executed but callbacks in RCU_NEXT_READY_TAIL
   still remain. Then rcu_segcblist_accelerate() is called with a
   snaphot of 20.

9) Since nothing started the grace period number 20, callbacks stay
   unhandled.

This has been reported in real load:

Fix this with taking the snapshot for acceleration _before_ the read
of the current grace period number.

The only side effect of this solution is that callbacks advancing happen
then _after_ the full barrier in rcu_seq_snap(). This is not a problem
because that barrier only cares about:

1) Ordering accesses of the update side before call_srcu() so they don't
   bleed.
2) See all the accesses prior to the grace period of the current gp_num

The only things callbacks advancing need to be ordered against are
carried by snp locking.
