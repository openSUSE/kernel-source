Subject: [PATCH] rust: Ignore preserve-most functions
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.2
Git-commit: bad098d76835c1379e1cf6afc935f8a7e050f83c

commit bad098d76835c1379e1cf6afc935f8a7e050f83c upstream.

Neither bindgen nor Rust know about the preserve-most calling
convention, and Clang describes it as unstable. Since we aren't using
functions with this calling convention from Rust, blocklist them.

These functions are only added to the build when list hardening is
enabled, which is likely why others didn't notice this yet.
