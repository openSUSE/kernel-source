Subject: [PATCH] cifs: Fix handling of a beyond-EOF DIO/unbuffered read over
 SMB1
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.2
Git-commit: 9d85ac939d52e93d80efb01a299c6f0bedb30487

[ Upstream commit 9d85ac939d52e93d80efb01a299c6f0bedb30487 ]

If a DIO read or an unbuffered read request extends beyond the EOF, the
server will return a short read and a status code indicating that EOF was
hit, which gets translated to -ENODATA.  Note that the client does not cap
the request at i_size, but asks for the amount requested in case there's a
race on the server with a third party.

Now, on the client side, the request will get split into multiple
subrequests if rsize is smaller than the full request size.  A subrequest
that starts before or at the EOF and returns short data up to the EOF will
be correctly handled, with the NETFS_SREQ_HIT_EOF flag being set,
indicating to netfslib that we can't read more.

If a subrequest, however, starts after the EOF and not at it, HIT_EOF will
not be flagged, its error will be set to -ENODATA and it will be abandoned.
This will cause the request as a whole to fail with -ENODATA.

Fix this by setting NETFS_SREQ_HIT_EOF on any subrequest that lies beyond
the EOF marker.

This can be reproduced by mounting with "cache=none,sign,vers=1.0" and
doing a read of a file that's significantly bigger than the size of the
file (e.g. attempting to read 64KiB from a 16KiB file).
