Subject: [PATCH] af_unix: fix regression in read after shutdown
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.6
Git-commit: f9390b249c90a15a4d9e69fbfb7a53c860b1fcaf

[ Upstream commit f9390b249c90a15a4d9e69fbfb7a53c860b1fcaf ]

On kernels before v5.15, calling read() on a unix socket after
shutdown(SHUT_RD) or shutdown(SHUT_RDWR) would return the data
previously written or EOF.  But now, while read() after
shutdown(SHUT_RD) still behaves the same way, read() after
shutdown(SHUT_RDWR) always fails with -EINVAL.

This behaviour change was apparently inadvertently introduced as part of
a bug fix for a different regression caused by the commit adding sockmap
support to af_unix, commit 94531cfcbe79c359 ("af_unix: Add
unix_stream_proto for sockmap").  Those commits, for unclear reasons,
started setting the socket state to TCP_CLOSE on shutdown(SHUT_RDWR),
while this state change had previously only been done in
unix_release_sock().

Restore the original behaviour.  The sockmap tests in
tests/selftests/bpf continue to pass after this patch.
