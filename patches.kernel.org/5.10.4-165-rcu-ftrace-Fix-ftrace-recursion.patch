Subject: [PATCH] rcu,ftrace: Fix ftrace recursion
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.4
Git-commit: d2098b4440981705e844c50254540ba7b5f82795

[ Upstream commit d2098b4440981705e844c50254540ba7b5f82795 ]

Kim reported that perf-ftrace made his box unhappy. It turns out that
commit:

  ff5c4f5cad33 ("rcu/tree: Mark the idle relevant functions noinstr")

removed one too many notrace qualifiers, probably due to there not being
a helpful comment.

This commit therefore reinstates the notrace and adds a comment to avoid
losing it again.

[ paulmck: Apply Steven Rostedt's feedback on the comment. ]
