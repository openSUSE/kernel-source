Subject: [PATCH] block: make REQ_OP_ZONE_OPEN a write operation
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.8
Git-commit: 19de03b312d69a7e9bacb51c806c6e3f4207376c

commit 19de03b312d69a7e9bacb51c806c6e3f4207376c upstream.

A REQ_OP_OPEN_ZONE request changes the condition of a sequential zone of
a zoned block device to the explicitly open condition
(BLK_ZONE_COND_EXP_OPEN). As such, it should be considered a write
operation.

Change this operation code to be an odd number to reflect this. The
following operation numbers are changed to keep the numbering compact.

No problems were reported without this change as this operation has no
data. However, this unifies the zone operation to reflect that they
modify the device state and also allows strengthening checks in the
block layer, e.g. checking if this operation is not issued against a
read-only device.

Fixes: 6c1b1da58f8c ("block: add zone open, close and finish operations")
