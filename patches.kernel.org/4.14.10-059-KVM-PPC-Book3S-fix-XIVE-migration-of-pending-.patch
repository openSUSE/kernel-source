Subject: [PATCH] KVM: PPC: Book3S: fix XIVE migration of pending interrupts

commit dc1c4165d189350cb51bdd3057deb6ecd164beda upstream.

When restoring a pending interrupt, we are setting the Q bit to force
a retrigger in xive_finish_unmask(). But we also need to force an EOI
in this case to reach the same initial state : P=1, Q=0.

This can be done by not setting 'old_p' for pending interrupts which
will inform xive_finish_unmask() that an EOI needs to be sent.
