Subject: [PATCH] net/cls_cgroup: Fix task_get_classid() during qdisc run

[ Upstream commit 66048f8b3cc7e462953c04285183cdee43a1cb89 ]

During recent testing with the netem qdisc to inject delays into TCP
traffic, we observed that our CLS BPF program failed to function correctly
due to incorrect classid retrieval from task_get_classid(). The issue
manifests in the following call stack:

        bpf_get_cgroup_classid+5
        cls_bpf_classify+507
        __tcf_classify+90
        tcf_classify+217

        sch_direct_xmit+161
        __qdisc_run+102             <<<<< Issue location

        __dev_queue_xmit+637

        ip_queue_xmit+21

        tcp_write_xmit+959
        __tcp_push_pending_frames+55
        tcp_push+264

        tcp_sendmsg+45

        sock_sendmsg+98
        sock_write_iter+147
        vfs_write+786
        ksys_write+181
        __x64_sys_write+25
        do_syscall_64+56
        entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+100

The problem occurs when multiple tasks share a single qdisc. In such cases,
__qdisc_run() may transmit skbs created by different tasks. Consequently,
task_get_classid() retrieves an incorrect classid since it references the
current task's context rather than the skb's originating task.

Given that dev_queue_xmit() always executes with bh disabled, we can use
softirq_count() instead to obtain the correct classid.

The simple steps to reproduce this issue:
1. Add network delay to the network interface:
  such as: tc qdisc add dev bond0 root netem delay 1.5ms
2. Build two distinct net_cls cgroups, each with a network-intensive task
3. Initiate parallel TCP streams from both tasks to external servers.

Under this specific condition, the issue reliably occurs. The kernel
eventually dequeues an SKB that originated from Task-A while executing in
the context of Task-B.

It is worth noting that it will change the established behavior for a
slightly different scenario:

  <sock S is created by task A>
  <class ID for task A is changed>
  <skb is created by sock S xmit and classified>

prior to this patch the skb will be classified with the 'new' task A
classid, now with the old/original one. The bpf_get_cgroup_classid_curr()
function is a more appropriate choice for this case.
