Subject: [PATCH] execve: expand new process stack manually ahead of time
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.37
Git-commit: f313c51d26aa87e69633c9b46efb37a930faca71

commit f313c51d26aa87e69633c9b46efb37a930faca71 upstream.

This is a small step towards a model where GUP itself would not expand
the stack, and any user that needs GUP to not look up existing mappings,
but actually expand on them, would have to do so manually before-hand,
and with the mm lock held for writing.

It turns out that execve() already did almost exactly that, except it
didn't take the mm lock at all (it's single-threaded so no locking
technically needed, but it could cause lockdep errors).  And it only did
it for the CONFIG_STACK_GROWSUP case, since in that case GUP has
obviously never expanded the stack downwards.

So just make that CONFIG_STACK_GROWSUP case do the right thing with
locking, and enable it generally.  This will eventually help GUP, and in
the meantime avoids a special case and the lockdep issue.
