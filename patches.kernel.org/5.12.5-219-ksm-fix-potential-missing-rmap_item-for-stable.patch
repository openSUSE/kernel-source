Subject: [PATCH] ksm: fix potential missing rmap_item for stable_node
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.5
Git-commit: c89a384e2551c692a9fe60d093fd7080f50afc51

[ Upstream commit c89a384e2551c692a9fe60d093fd7080f50afc51 ]

When removing rmap_item from stable tree, STABLE_FLAG of rmap_item is
cleared with head reserved.  So the following scenario might happen: For
ksm page with rmap_item1:

cmp_and_merge_page
  stable_node->head = &migrate_nodes;
  remove_rmap_item_from_tree, but head still equal to stable_node;
  try_to_merge_with_ksm_page failed;
  return;

For the same ksm page with rmap_item2, stable node migration succeed this
time.  The stable_node->head does not equal to migrate_nodes now.  For ksm
page with rmap_item1 again:

cmp_and_merge_page
 stable_node->head != &migrate_nodes && rmap_item->head == stable_node
 return;

We would miss the rmap_item for stable_node and might result in failed
rmap_walk_ksm().  Fix this by set rmap_item->head to NULL when rmap_item
is removed from stable tree.
