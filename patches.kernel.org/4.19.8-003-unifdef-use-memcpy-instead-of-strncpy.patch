Subject: [PATCH] unifdef: use memcpy instead of strncpy
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.8
Git-commit: 38c7b224ce22c25fed04007839edf974bd13439d

commit 38c7b224ce22c25fed04007839edf974bd13439d upstream.

New versions of gcc reasonably warn about the odd pattern of

	strncpy(p, q, strlen(q));

which really doesn't make sense: the strncpy() ends up being just a slow
and odd way to write memcpy() in this case.

There was a comment about _why_ the code used strncpy - to avoid the
terminating NUL byte, but memcpy does the same and avoids the warning.
