Subject: [PATCH] scsi: mpt3sas: Fix clear pending bit in ioctl status
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.8
Git-commit: 782b281883caf70289ba6a186af29441a117d23e

[ Upstream commit 782b281883caf70289ba6a186af29441a117d23e ]

When user issues diag register command from application with required size,
and if driver unable to allocate the memory, then it will fail the register
command. While failing the register command, driver is not currently
clearing MPT3_CMD_PENDING bit in ctl_cmds.status variable which was set
before trying to allocate the memory. As this bit is set, subsequent
register command will be failed with BUSY status even when user wants to
register the trace buffer will less memory.

Clear MPT3_CMD_PENDING bit in ctl_cmds.status before returning the diag
register command with no memory status.
