Subject: [PATCH] cgroup: Reinit cgroup_taskset structure before
 cgroup_migrate_execute() returns
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.13.6
Git-commit: c4fa6c43ce4b427350cfbb659436bfe3d9e09a1d

commit c4fa6c43ce4b427350cfbb659436bfe3d9e09a1d upstream.

The cgroup_taskset structure within the larger cgroup_mgctx structure
is supposed to be used once and then discarded. That is not really the
case in the hotplug code path:

cpuset_hotplug_workfn()
 - cgroup_transfer_tasks()
   - cgroup_migrate()
     - cgroup_migrate_add_task()
     - cgroup_migrate_execute()

In this case, the cgroup_migrate() function is called multiple time
with the same cgroup_mgctx structure to transfer the tasks from
one cgroup to another one-by-one. The second time cgroup_migrate()
is called, the cgroup_taskset will be in an incorrect state and so
may cause the system to panic. For example,

To allow reuse of the cgroup_mgctx structure, some fields in that
structure are now re-initialized at the end of cgroup_migrate_execute()
function call so that the structure can be reused again in a later
iteration without causing problem.

This bug was introduced in the commit e595cd706982 ("group: track
migration context in cgroup_mgctx") in 4.11. This commit moves the
cgroup_taskset initialization out of cgroup_migrate(). The commit
10467270fb3 ("cgroup: don't call migration methods if there are no
tasks to migrate") helped, but did not completely resolve the problem.
