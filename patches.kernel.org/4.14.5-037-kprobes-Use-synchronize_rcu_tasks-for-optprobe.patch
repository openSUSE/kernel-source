Subject: [PATCH] kprobes: Use synchronize_rcu_tasks() for optprobe with
 CONFIG_PREEMPT=y
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.5
Git-commit: a30b85df7d599f626973e9cd3056fe755bd778e0

[ Upstream commit a30b85df7d599f626973e9cd3056fe755bd778e0 ]

We want to wait for all potentially preempted kprobes trampoline
execution to have completed. This guarantees that any freed
trampoline memory is not in use by any task in the system anymore.
synchronize_rcu_tasks() gives such a guarantee, so use it.

Also, this guarantees to wait for all potentially preempted tasks
on the instructions which will be replaced with a jump.

Since this becomes a problem only when CONFIG_PREEMPT=y, enable
CONFIG_TASKS_RCU=y for synchronize_rcu_tasks() in that case.
