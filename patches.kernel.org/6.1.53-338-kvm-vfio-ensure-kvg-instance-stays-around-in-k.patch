Subject: [PATCH] kvm/vfio: ensure kvg instance stays around in
 kvm_vfio_group_add()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.53
Git-commit: 9e0f4f2918c2ff145d3dedee862d9919a6ed5812

[ Upstream commit 9e0f4f2918c2ff145d3dedee862d9919a6ed5812 ]

kvm_vfio_group_add() creates kvg instance, links it to kv->group_list,
and calls kvm_vfio_file_set_kvm() with kvg->file as an argument after
dropping kv->lock. If we race group addition and deletion calls, kvg
instance may get freed by the time we get around to calling
kvm_vfio_file_set_kvm().

Previous iterations of the code did not reference kvg->file outside of
the critical section, but used a temporary variable. Still, they had
similar problem of the file reference being owned by kvg structure and
potential for kvm_vfio_group_del() dropping it before
kvm_vfio_group_add() had a chance to complete.

Fix this by moving call to kvm_vfio_file_set_kvm() under the protection
of kv->lock. We already call it while holding the same lock when vfio
group is being deleted, so it should be safe here as well.

Fixes: 2fc1bec15883 ("kvm: set/clear kvm to/from vfio_group when group add/delete")
