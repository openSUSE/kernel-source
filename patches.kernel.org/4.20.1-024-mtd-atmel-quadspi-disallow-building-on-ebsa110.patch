Subject: [PATCH] mtd: atmel-quadspi: disallow building on ebsa110
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.1
Git-commit: 2a9d92fb3a1282a4659f1bb6d5684018846537b7

commit 2a9d92fb3a1282a4659f1bb6d5684018846537b7 upstream.

I ran into a link-time error with the atmel-quadspi driver on the
EBSA110 platform:

drivers/mtd/built-in.o: In function `atmel_qspi_run_command':
:(.text+0x1ee3c): undefined reference to `_memcpy_toio'
:(.text+0x1ee48): undefined reference to `_memcpy_fromio'

The problem is that _memcpy_toio/_memcpy_fromio are not available on
that platform, and we have to prevent building the driver there.

In case we want to backport this to older kernels: between linux-4.8
and linux-4.20, the Kconfig entry was in drivers/mtd/spi-nor/Kconfig
but had the same problem.
