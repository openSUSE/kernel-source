Subject: [PATCH] of/fdt: Make sure no-map does not remove already reserved
 regions
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.3
Git-commit: 8a5a75e5e9e55de1cef5d83ca3589cb4899193ef

[ Upstream commit 8a5a75e5e9e55de1cef5d83ca3589cb4899193ef ]

If the device tree is incorrectly configured, and attempts to
define a "no-map" reserved memory that overlaps with the kernel
data/code, the kernel would crash quickly after boot, with no
obvious clue about the nature of the issue.

For example, this would happen if we have the kernel mapped at
these addresses (from /proc/iomem):
40000000-41ffffff : System RAM
  40080000-40dfffff : Kernel code
  40e00000-411fffff : reserved
  41200000-413e0fff : Kernel data

And we declare a no-map shared-dma-pool region at a fixed address
within that range:
mem_reserved: mem_region {
	compatible = "shared-dma-pool";
	reg = <0 0x40000000 0 0x01A00000>;
	no-map;
};

To fix this, when removing memory regions at early boot (which is
what "no-map" regions do), we need to make sure that the memory
is not already reserved. If we do, __reserved_mem_reserve_reg
will throw an error:
[    0.000000] OF: fdt: Reserved memory: failed to reserve memory
   for node 'mem_region': base 0x0000000040000000, size 26 MiB
and the code that will try to use the region should also fail,
later on.

We do not do anything for non-"no-map" regions, as memblock
explicitly allows reserved regions to overlap, and the commit
that this fixes removed the check for that precise reason.
