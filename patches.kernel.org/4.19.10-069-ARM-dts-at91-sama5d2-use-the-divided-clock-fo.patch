Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: at91: sama5d2: use the divided clock for SMC
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.10
Git-commit: 4ab7ca092c3c7ac8b16aa28eba723a8868f82f14

[ Upstream commit 4ab7ca092c3c7ac8b16aa28eba723a8868f82f14 ]

The SAMA5D2 is different from SAMA5D3 and SAMA5D4, as there are two
different clocks for the peripherals in the SoC. The Static Memory
controller is connected to the divided master clock.

Unfortunately, the device tree does not correctly show this and uses the
master clock directly. This clock is then used by the code for the NAND
controller to calculate the timings for the controller, and we end up with
slow NAND Flash access.

Fix the device tree, and the performance of Flash access is improved.
