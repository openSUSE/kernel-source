Subject: [PATCH] arm64: mte: initialize RGSR_EL1.SEED in __cpu_setup
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.5
Git-commit: 37a8024d265564eba680575df6421f19db21dfce

commit 37a8024d265564eba680575df6421f19db21dfce upstream.

A valid implementation choice for the ChooseRandomNonExcludedTag()
pseudocode function used by IRG is to behave in the same way as with
GCR_EL1.RRND=0. This would mean that RGSR_EL1.SEED is used as an LFSR
which must have a non-zero value in order for IRG to properly produce
pseudorandom numbers. However, RGSR_EL1 is reset to an UNKNOWN value
on soft reset and thus may reset to 0. Therefore we must initialize
RGSR_EL1.SEED to a non-zero value in order to ensure that IRG behaves
as expected.
