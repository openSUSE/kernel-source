Subject: [PATCH] LoongArch: KVM: Fix kvm_device leak in kvm_ipi_destroy()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.7
Git-commit: 0bf58cb7288a4d3de6d8ecbb3a65928a9362bf21

commit 0bf58cb7288a4d3de6d8ecbb3a65928a9362bf21 upstream.

In kvm_ioctl_create_device(), kvm_device has allocated memory,
kvm_device->destroy() seems to be supposed to free its kvm_device
struct, but kvm_ipi_destroy() is not currently doing this, that
would lead to a memory leak.

So, fix it.
