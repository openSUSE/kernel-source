Subject: [PATCH] function_graph: Move return callback before update of
 curr_ret_stack
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.7
Git-commit: 552701dd0fa7c3d448142e87210590ba424694a0

commit 552701dd0fa7c3d448142e87210590ba424694a0 upstream.

In the past, curr_ret_stack had two functions. One was to denote the depth
of the call graph, the other is to keep track of where on the ret_stack the
data is used. Although they may be slightly related, there are two cases
where they need to be used differently.

The one case is that it keeps the ret_stack data from being corrupted by an
interrupt coming in and overwriting the data still in use. The other is just
to know where the depth of the stack currently is.

The function profiler uses the ret_stack to save a "subtime" variable that
is part of the data on the ret_stack. If curr_ret_stack is modified too
early, then this variable can be corrupted.

The "max_depth" option, when set to 1, will record the first functions going
into the kernel. To see all top functions (when dealing with timings), the
depth variable needs to be lowered before calling the return hook. But by
lowering the curr_ret_stack, it makes the data on the ret_stack still being
used by the return hook susceptible to being overwritten.

Now that there's two variables to handle both cases (curr_ret_depth), we can
move them to the locations where they can handle both cases.
