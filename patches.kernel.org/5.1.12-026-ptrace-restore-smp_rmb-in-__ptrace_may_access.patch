Subject: [PATCH] ptrace: restore smp_rmb() in __ptrace_may_access()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.12
Git-commit: f6581f5b55141a95657ef5742cf6a6bfa20a109f

commit f6581f5b55141a95657ef5742cf6a6bfa20a109f upstream.

Restore the read memory barrier in __ptrace_may_access() that was deleted
a couple years ago. Also add comments on this barrier and the one it pairs
with to explain why they're there (as far as I understand).

Fixes: bfedb589252c ("mm: Add a user_ns owner to mm_struct and fix ptrace permission checks")
