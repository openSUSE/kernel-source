Subject: [PATCH] xfs: always warn about deprecated mount options
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.56
Git-commit: 630785bfbe12c3ee3ebccd8b530a98d632b7e39d

[ Upstream commit 630785bfbe12c3ee3ebccd8b530a98d632b7e39d ]

The deprecation of the 'attr2' mount option in 6.18 wasn't entirely
successful because nobody noticed that the kernel never printed a
warning about attr2 being set in fstab if the only xfs filesystem is the
root fs; the initramfs mounts the root fs with no mount options; and the
init scripts only conveyed the fstab options by remounting the root fs.

Fix this by making it complain all the time.
