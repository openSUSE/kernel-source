Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: connect: fail if nft supposed to work
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.40
Git-commit: 221e4550454a822f9a11834e30694c7d1d65747c

commit 221e4550454a822f9a11834e30694c7d1d65747c upstream.

In case of "external" errors when preparing the environment for the
TProxy tests, the subtests were marked as skipped.

This is fine but it means these errors are ignored. On MPTCP Public CI,
we do want to catch such issues and mark the selftest as failed if there
are such issues. We can then use mptcp_lib_fail_if_expected_feature()
helper that has been recently added to fail if needed.
