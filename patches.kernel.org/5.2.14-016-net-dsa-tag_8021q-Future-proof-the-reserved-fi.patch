Subject: [PATCH] net: dsa: tag_8021q: Future-proof the reserved fields in the
 custom VID
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.14
Git-commit: bcccb0a535bb99616e4b992568371efab1ab14e8

[ Upstream commit bcccb0a535bb99616e4b992568371efab1ab14e8 ]

After witnessing the discussion in https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/8/14/151
w.r.t. ioctl extensibility, it became clear that such an issue might
prevent that the 3 RSV bits inside the DSA 802.1Q tag might also suffer
the same fate and be useless for further extension.

So clearly specify that the reserved bits should currently be
transmitted as zero and ignored on receive. The DSA tagger already does
this (and has always did), and is the only known user so far (no
Wireshark dissection plugin, etc). So there should be no incompatibility
to speak of.
