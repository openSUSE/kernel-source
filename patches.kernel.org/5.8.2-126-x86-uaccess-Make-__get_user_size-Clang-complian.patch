Subject: [PATCH] x86/uaccess: Make __get_user_size() Clang compliant on 32-bit
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.2
Git-commit: 158807de5822d1079e162a3762956fd743dd483e

[ Upstream commit 158807de5822d1079e162a3762956fd743dd483e ]

Clang fails to compile __get_user_size() on 32-bit for the following code:

      long long val;

      __get_user(val, usrptr);

with: error: invalid output size for constraint '=q'

GCC compiles the same code without complaints.

The reason is that GCC and Clang are architecturally different, which leads
to subtle issues for code that's invalid but clearly dead, i.e. with code
that emulates polymorphism with the preprocessor and sizeof.

GCC will perform semantic analysis after early inlining and dead code
elimination, so it will not warn on invalid code that's dead. Clang
strictly performs optimizations after semantic analysis, so it will warn
for dead code.

Neither Clang nor GCC like this very much with -m32:

long long ret;
asm ("movb $5, %0" : "=q" (ret));

However, GCC can tolerate this variant:

long long ret;
switch (sizeof(ret)) {
case 1:
        asm ("movb $5, %0" : "=q" (ret));
        break;
case 8:;
}

Clang, on the other hand, won't accept that because it validates the inline
asm for the '1' case before the optimisation phase where it realises that
it wouldn't have to emit it anyway.

If LLVM (Clang's "back end") fails such as during instruction selection or
register allocation, it cannot provide accurate diagnostics (warnings /
errors) that contain line information, as the AST has been discarded from
memory at that point.

While there have been early discussions about having C/C++ specific
language optimizations in Clang via the use of MLIR, which would enable
such earlier optimizations, such work is not scoped and likely a multi-year
endeavor.

It was discussed to change the asm output constraint for the one byte case
from "=q" to "=r". While it works for 64-bit, it fails on 32-bit. With '=r'
the compiler could fail to chose a register accessible as high/low which is
required for the byte operation. If that happens the assembly will fail.

Use a local temporary variable of type 'unsigned char' as output for the
byte copy inline asm and then assign it to the real output variable. This
prevents Clang from failing the semantic analysis in the above case.

The resulting code for the actual one byte copy is not affected as the
temporary variable is optimized out.
