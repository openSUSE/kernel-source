Subject: [PATCH] nvme-core: check for too small lba shift
References: bsc#1218052
Patch-mainline: 6.1.74
Git-commit: 74fbc88e161424b3b96a22b23a8e3e1edab9d05c

[ Upstream commit 74fbc88e161424b3b96a22b23a8e3e1edab9d05c ]

The block layer doesn't support logical block sizes smaller than 512
bytes. The nvme spec doesn't support that small either, but the driver
isn't checking to make sure the device responded with usable data.
Failing to catch this will result in a kernel bug, either from a
division by zero when stacking, or a zero length bio.
