Subject: [PATCH] crypto: skcipher - don't WARN on unprocessed data after slow
 walk step
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.4
Git-commit: dcaca01a42cc2c425154a13412b4124293a6e11e

commit dcaca01a42cc2c425154a13412b4124293a6e11e upstream.

skcipher_walk_done() assumes it's a bug if, after the "slow" path is
executed where the next chunk of data is processed via a bounce buffer,
the algorithm says it didn't process all bytes.  Thus it WARNs on this.

However, this can happen legitimately when the message needs to be
evenly divisible into "blocks" but isn't, and the algorithm has a
'walksize' greater than the block size.  For example, ecb-aes-neonbs
sets 'walksize' to 128 bytes and only supports messages evenly divisible
into 16-byte blocks.  If, say, 17 message bytes remain but they straddle
scatterlist elements, the skcipher_walk code will take the "slow" path
and pass the algorithm all 17 bytes in the bounce buffer.  But the
algorithm will only be able to process 16 bytes, triggering the WARN.

Fix this by just removing the WARN_ON().  Returning -EINVAL, as the code
already does, is the right behavior.

This bug was detected by my patches that improve testmgr to fuzz
algorithms against their generic implementation.
