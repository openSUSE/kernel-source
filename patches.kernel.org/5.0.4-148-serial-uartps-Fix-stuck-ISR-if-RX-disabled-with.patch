Subject: [PATCH] serial: uartps: Fix stuck ISR if RX disabled with non-empty
 FIFO
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.4
Git-commit: 7abab1605139bc41442864c18f9573440f7ca105

commit 7abab1605139bc41442864c18f9573440f7ca105 upstream.

If RX is disabled while there are still unprocessed bytes in RX FIFO,
cdns_uart_handle_rx() called from interrupt handler will get stuck in
the receive loop as read bytes will not get removed from the RX FIFO
and CDNS_UART_SR_RXEMPTY bit will never get set.

Avoid the stuck handler by checking first if RX is disabled. port->lock
protects against race with RX-disabling functions.

This HW behavior was mentioned by Nathan Rossi in 43e98facc4a3 ("tty:
xuartps: Fix RX hang, and TX corruption in termios call") which fixed a
similar issue in cdns_uart_set_termios().
The behavior can also be easily verified by e.g. setting
CDNS_UART_CR_RX_DIS at the beginning of cdns_uart_handle_rx() - the
following loop will then get stuck.

Resetting the FIFO using RXRST would not set RXEMPTY either so simply
issuing a reset after RX-disable would not work.

I observe this frequently on a ZynqMP board during heavy RX load at 1M
baudrate when the reader process exits and thus RX gets disabled.
