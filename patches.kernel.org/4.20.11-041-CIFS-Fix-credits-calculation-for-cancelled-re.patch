Subject: [PATCH] CIFS: Fix credits calculation for cancelled requests
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.11
Git-commit: 8a26f0f781f56d3016b34a2217e346973d067e7b

[ Upstream commit 8a26f0f781f56d3016b34a2217e346973d067e7b ]

If a request is cancelled, we can't assume that the server returns
1 credit back. Instead we need to wait for a response and process
the number of credits granted by the server.

Create a separate mid callback for cancelled request, parse the number
of credits in a response buffer and add them to the client's credits.
If the didn't get a response (no response buffer available) assume
0 credits granted. The latter most probably happens together with
session reconnect, so the client's credits are adjusted anyway.
