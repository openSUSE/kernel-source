commit 845b89127bc5458d0152a4d63f165c62a22fcb70 upstream.

By default, PCI drivers with runtime PM enabled will skip the calls
to suspend and resume on system PM. For this driver, we don't want
that, as we need to perform additional steps for system PM to work
properly on all systems. So instruct the PM core to not skip these
calls.
