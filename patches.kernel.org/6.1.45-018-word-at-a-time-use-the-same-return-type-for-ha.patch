Subject: [PATCH] word-at-a-time: use the same return type for has_zero
 regardless of endianness
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.45
Git-commit: 79e8328e5acbe691bbde029a52c89d70dcbc22f3

[ Upstream commit 79e8328e5acbe691bbde029a52c89d70dcbc22f3 ]

Compiling big-endian targets with Clang produces the diagnostic:

  fs/namei.c:2173:13: warning: use of bitwise '|' with boolean operands [-Wbitwise-instead-of-logical]
	} while (!(has_zero(a, &adata, &constants) | has_zero(b, &bdata, &constants)));
	          ~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                                               ||
  fs/namei.c:2173:13: note: cast one or both operands to int to silence this warning

It appears that when has_zero was introduced, two definitions were
produced with different signatures (in particular different return
types).

Looking at the usage in hash_name() in fs/namei.c, I suspect that
has_zero() is meant to be invoked twice per while loop iteration; using
logical-or would not update `bdata` when `a` did not have zeros.  So I
think it's preferred to always return an unsigned long rather than a
bool than update the while loop in hash_name() to use a logical-or
rather than bitwise-or.

[ Also changed powerpc version to do the same  - Linus ]
