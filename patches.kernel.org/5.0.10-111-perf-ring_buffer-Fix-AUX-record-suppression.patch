Subject: [PATCH] perf/ring_buffer: Fix AUX record suppression
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.10
Git-commit: 339bc4183596e1f68c2c98a03b87aa124107c317

commit 339bc4183596e1f68c2c98a03b87aa124107c317 upstream.

The following commit:

  1627314fb54a33e ("perf: Suppress AUX/OVERWRITE records")

has an unintended side-effect of also suppressing all AUX records with no flags
and non-zero size, so all the regular records in the full trace mode.
This breaks some use cases for people.

Fix this by restoring "regular" AUX records.
