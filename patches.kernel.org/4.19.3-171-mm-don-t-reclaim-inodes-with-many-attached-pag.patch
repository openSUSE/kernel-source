Subject: [PATCH] mm: don't reclaim inodes with many attached pages
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.3
Git-commit: a76cf1a474d7dbcd9336b5f5afb0162baa142cf0

commit a76cf1a474d7dbcd9336b5f5afb0162baa142cf0 upstream.

Spock reported that commit 172b06c32b94 ("mm: slowly shrink slabs with a
relatively small number of objects") leads to a regression on his setup:
periodically the majority of the pagecache is evicted without an obvious
reason, while before the change the amount of free memory was balancing
around the watermark.

The reason behind is that the mentioned above change created some
minimal background pressure on the inode cache.  The problem is that if
an inode is considered to be reclaimed, all belonging pagecache page are
stripped, no matter how many of them are there.  So, if a huge
multi-gigabyte file is cached in the memory, and the goal is to reclaim
only few slab objects (unused inodes), we still can eventually evict all
gigabytes of the pagecache at once.

The workload described by Spock has few large non-mapped files in the
pagecache, so it's especially noticeable.

To solve the problem let's postpone the reclaim of inodes, which have
more than 1 attached page.  Let's wait until the pagecache pages will be
evicted naturally by scanning the corresponding LRU lists, and only then
reclaim the inode structure.
