Subject: [PATCH] zsmalloc: calling zs_map_object() from irq is a bug
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.6
Git-commit: 1aedcafbf32b3f232c159b14cd0d423fcfe2b861

[ Upstream commit 1aedcafbf32b3f232c159b14cd0d423fcfe2b861 ]

Use BUG_ON(in_interrupt()) in zs_map_object().  This is not a new
BUG_ON(), it's always been there, but was recently changed to
VM_BUG_ON().  There are several problems there.  First, we use use
per-CPU mappings both in zsmalloc and in zram, and interrupt may easily
corrupt those buffers.  Second, and more importantly, we believe it's
possible to start leaking sensitive information.  Consider the following
case:

-> process P
	swap out
	 zram
	  per-cpu mapping CPU1
	   compress page A
-> IRQ

	swap out
	 zram
	  per-cpu mapping CPU1
	   compress page B
	    write page from per-cpu mapping CPU1 to zsmalloc pool
	iret

-> process P
	    write page from per-cpu mapping CPU1 to zsmalloc pool  [*]
	return

* so we store overwritten data that actually belongs to another
  page (task) and potentially contains sensitive data. And when
  process P will page fault it's going to read (swap in) that
  other task's data.
