Subject: [PATCH] HID: input: Ignore battery reported by Symbol DS4308
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.9
Git-commit: 0fd791841a6d67af1155a9c3de54dea51220721e

[ Upstream commit 0fd791841a6d67af1155a9c3de54dea51220721e ]

The Motorola/Zebra Symbol DS4308-HD is a handheld USB barcode scanner
which does not have a battery, but reports one anyway that always has
capacity 2.

Let's apply the IGNORE quirk to prevent it from being treated like a
power supply so that userspaces don't get confused that this
accessory is almost out of power and warn the user that they need to charge
their wired barcode scanner.
