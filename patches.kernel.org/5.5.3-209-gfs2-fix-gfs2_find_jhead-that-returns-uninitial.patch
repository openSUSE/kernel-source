Subject: [PATCH] gfs2: fix gfs2_find_jhead that returns uninitialized jhead
 with seq 0
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.3
Git-commit: 7582026f6f3588ecebd281965c8a71aff6fb6158

commit 7582026f6f3588ecebd281965c8a71aff6fb6158 upstream.

When the first log header in a journal happens to have a sequence
number of 0, a bug in gfs2_find_jhead() causes it to prematurely exit,
and return an uninitialized jhead with seq 0. This can cause failures
in the caller. For instance, a mount fails in one test case.

The correct behavior is for it to continue searching through the journal
to find the correct journal head with the highest sequence number.

Fixes: f4686c26ecc3 ("gfs2: read journal in large chunks")
