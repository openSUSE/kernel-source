Subject: [PATCH] neighbour: Don't let neigh_forced_gc() disable preemption for
 long
References: bsc#1218052
Patch-mainline: 6.1.74
Git-commit: e5dc5afff62f3e97e86c3643ec9fcad23de4f2d3

[ Upstream commit e5dc5afff62f3e97e86c3643ec9fcad23de4f2d3 ]

We are seeing cases where neigh_cleanup_and_release() is called by
neigh_forced_gc() many times in a row with preemption turned off.
When running on a low powered CPU at a low CPU frequency, this has
been measured to keep preemption off for ~10 ms. That's not great on a
system with HZ=1000 which expects tasks to be able to schedule in
with ~1ms latency.
