Subject: [PATCH] media: venus: put dummy vote on video-mem path after last
 session release
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.4
Git-commit: eff5ce02e170125936c43ca96c7dc701a86681ed

[ Upstream commit eff5ce02e170125936c43ca96c7dc701a86681ed ]

As per current implementation, video driver is unvoting "videom-mem" path
for last video session during vdec_session_release().
While video playback when we try to suspend device, we see video clock
warnings since votes are already removed during vdec_session_release().

corrected this by putting dummy vote on "video-mem" after last video
session release and unvoting it during suspend.
