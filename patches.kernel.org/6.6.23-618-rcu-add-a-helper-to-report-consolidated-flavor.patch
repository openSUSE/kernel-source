Subject: [PATCH] rcu: add a helper to report consolidated flavor QS
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.23
Git-commit: 1a77557d48cff187a169c2aec01c0dd78a5e7e50

[ Upstream commit 1a77557d48cff187a169c2aec01c0dd78a5e7e50 ]

When under heavy load, network processing can run CPU-bound for many
tens of seconds. Even in preemptible kernels (non-RT kernel), this can
block RCU Tasks grace periods, which can cause trace-event removal to
take more than a minute, which is unacceptably long.

This commit therefore creates a new helper function that passes through
both RCU and RCU-Tasks quiescent states every 100 milliseconds. This
hard-coded value suffices for current workloads.

+ * rcu_softirq_qs_periodic - Report RCU and RCU-Tasks quiescent states
+ * @old_ts: jiffies at start of processing.
+ *
+ * This helper is for long-running softirq handlers, such as NAPI threads in
+ * networking. The caller should initialize the variable passed in as @old_ts
+ * at the beginning of the softirq handler. When invoked frequently, this macro
+ * will invoke rcu_softirq_qs() every 100 milliseconds thereafter, which will
+ * provide both RCU and RCU-Tasks quiescent states. Note that this macro
+ * modifies its old_ts argument.
+ *
+ * Because regions of code that have disabled softirq act as RCU read-side
+ * critical sections, this macro should be invoked with softirq (and
+ * preemption) enabled.
+ *
+ * The macro is not needed when CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT is defined. RT kernels would
+ * have more chance to invoke schedule() calls and provide necessary quiescent
+ * states. As a contrast, calling cond_resched() only won't achieve the same
+ * effect because cond_resched() does not provide RCU-Tasks quiescent states.
