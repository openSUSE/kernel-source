Subject: [PATCH] habanalabs: disable FW events on device removal
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.14
Git-commit: 2dc4a6d79168e7e426e8ddf8e7219c9ffd13b2b1

[ Upstream commit 2dc4a6d79168e7e426e8ddf8e7219c9ffd13b2b1 ]

When device is removed, we need to make sure the F/W won't send us
any more events because during the remove process we disable the
interrupts.
