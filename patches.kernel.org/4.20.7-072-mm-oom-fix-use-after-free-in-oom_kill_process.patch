Subject: [PATCH] mm, oom: fix use-after-free in oom_kill_process
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.7
Git-commit: cefc7ef3c87d02fc9307835868ff721ea12cc597

commit cefc7ef3c87d02fc9307835868ff721ea12cc597 upstream.

Syzbot instance running on upstream kernel found a use-after-free bug in
oom_kill_process.  On further inspection it seems like the process
selected to be oom-killed has exited even before reaching
read_lock(&tasklist_lock) in oom_kill_process().  More specifically the
tsk->usage is 1 which is due to get_task_struct() in oom_evaluate_task()
and the put_task_struct within for_each_thread() frees the tsk and
for_each_thread() tries to access the tsk.  The easiest fix is to do
get/put across the for_each_thread() on the selected task.

Now the next question is should we continue with the oom-kill as the
previously selected task has exited? However before adding more
complexity and heuristics, let's answer why we even look at the children
of oom-kill selected task? The select_bad_process() has already selected
the worst process in the system/memcg.  Due to race, the selected
process might not be the worst at the kill time but does that matter?
The userspace can use the oom_score_adj interface to prefer children to
be killed before the parent.  I looked at the history but it seems like
this is there before git history.
