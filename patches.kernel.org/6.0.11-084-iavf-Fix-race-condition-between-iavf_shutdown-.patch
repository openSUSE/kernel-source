Subject: [PATCH] iavf: Fix race condition between iavf_shutdown and
 iavf_remove
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.11
Git-commit: a8417330f8a57275ed934293e832982b6d882713

[ Upstream commit a8417330f8a57275ed934293e832982b6d882713 ]

Fix a deadlock introduced by commit
974578017fc1 ("iavf: Add waiting so the port is initialized in remove")
due to race condition between iavf_shutdown and iavf_remove, where
iavf_remove stucks forever in while loop since iavf_shutdown already
set __IAVF_REMOVE adapter state.

Fix this by checking if the __IAVF_IN_REMOVE_TASK has already been
set and return if so.

Fixes: 974578017fc1 ("iavf: Add waiting so the port is initialized in remove")
