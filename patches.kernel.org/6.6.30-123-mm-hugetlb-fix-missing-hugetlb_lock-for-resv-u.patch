Subject: [PATCH] mm/hugetlb: fix missing hugetlb_lock for resv uncharge
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.30
Git-commit: b76b46902c2d0395488c8412e1116c2486cdfcb2

commit b76b46902c2d0395488c8412e1116c2486cdfcb2 upstream.

There is a recent report on UFFDIO_COPY over hugetlb:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/000000000000ee06de0616177560@google.com/

350:	lockdep_assert_held(&hugetlb_lock);

Should be an issue in hugetlb but triggered in an userfault context, where
it goes into the unlikely path where two threads modifying the resv map
together.  Mike has a fix in that path for resv uncharge but it looks like
the locking criteria was overlooked: hugetlb_cgroup_uncharge_folio_rsvd()
will update the cgroup pointer, so it requires to be called with the lock
held.
