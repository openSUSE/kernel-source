Subject: [PATCH] Revert "mm: fix initialization of struct page for holes in
 memory layout"
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.11
Git-commit: 377bf660d07a47269510435d11f3b65d53edca20

commit 377bf660d07a47269510435d11f3b65d53edca20 upstream.

This reverts commit d3921cb8be29ce5668c64e23ffdaeec5f8c69399.

Chris Wilson reports that it causes boot problems:

 "We have half a dozen or so different machines in CI that are silently
  failing to boot, that we believe is bisected to this patch"

and the CI team confirmed that a revert fixed the issues.

The cause is unknown for now, so let's revert it.

 /*
- * Only struct pages that correspond to ranges defined by memblock.memory
- * are zeroed and initialized by going through __init_single_page() during
- * memmap_init().
- *
- * But, there could be struct pages that correspond to holes in
- * memblock.memory. This can happen because of the following reasons:
- * - phyiscal memory bank size is not necessarily the exact multiple of the
- *   arbitrary section size
- * - early reserved memory may not be listed in memblock.memory
- * - memory layouts defined with memmap= kernel parameter may not align
- *   nicely with memmap sections
+ * Only struct pages that are backed by physical memory are zeroed and
+ * initialized by going through __init_single_page(). But, there are some
+ * struct pages which are reserved in memblock allocator and their fields
+ * may be accessed (for example page_to_pfn() on some configuration accesses
+ * flags). We must explicitly initialize those struct pages.
  *
- * Explicitly initialize those struct pages so that:
- * - PG_Reserved is set
- * - zone link is set accorging to the architecture constrains
- * - node is set to node id of the next populated region except for the
- *   trailing hole where last node id is used
+ * This function also addresses a similar issue where struct pages are left
+ * uninitialized because the physical address range is not covered by
+ * memblock.memory or memblock.reserved. That could happen when memblock
+ * layout is manually configured via memmap=, or when the highest physical
+ * address (max_pfn) does not end on a section boundary.
