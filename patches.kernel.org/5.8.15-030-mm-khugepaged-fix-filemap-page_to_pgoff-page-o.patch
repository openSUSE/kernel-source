commit 033b5d77551167f8c24ca862ce83d3e0745f9245 upstream.

There have been elusive reports of filemap_fault() hitting its
VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(page_to_pgoff(page) != offset, page) on kernels built
with CONFIG_READ_ONLY_THP_FOR_FS=y.

Suren has hit it on a kernel with CONFIG_READ_ONLY_THP_FOR_FS=y and
CONFIG_NUMA is not set: and he has analyzed it down to how khugepaged
without NUMA reuses the same huge page after collapse_file() failed
(whereas NUMA targets its allocation to the respective node each time).
And most of us were usually testing with CONFIG_NUMA=y kernels.

collapse_file(old start)
  new_page = khugepaged_alloc_page(hpage)
  __SetPageLocked(new_page)
  new_page->index = start // hpage->index=old offset
  new_page->mapping = mapping
  xas_store(&xas, new_page)

                          filemap_fault
                            page = find_get_page(mapping, offset)
                            // if offset falls inside hpage then
                            // compound_head(page) == hpage
                            lock_page_maybe_drop_mmap()
                              __lock_page(page)

  // collapse fails
  xas_store(&xas, old page)
  new_page->mapping = NULL
  unlock_page(new_page)

collapse_file(new start)
  new_page = khugepaged_alloc_page(hpage)
  __SetPageLocked(new_page)
  new_page->index = start // hpage->index=new offset
  new_page->mapping = mapping // mapping becomes valid again

                            // since compound_head(page) == hpage
                            // page_to_pgoff(page) got changed
                            VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(page_to_pgoff(page) != offset)

An initial patch replaced __SetPageLocked() by lock_page(), which did
fix the race which Suren illustrates above.  But testing showed that it's
not good enough: if the racing task's __lock_page() gets delayed long
after its find_get_page(), then it may follow collapse_file(new start)'s
successful final unlock_page(), and crash on the same VM_BUG_ON_PAGE.

It could be fixed by relaxing filemap_fault()'s VM_BUG_ON_PAGE to a
check and retry (as is done for mapping), with similar relaxations in
find_lock_entry() and pagecache_get_page(): but it's not obvious what
else might get caught out; and khugepaged non-NUMA appears to be unique
in exposing a page to page cache, then revoking, without going through
a full cycle of freeing before reuse.

Instead, non-NUMA khugepaged_prealloc_page() release the old page
if anyone else has a reference to it (1% of cases when I tested).

Although never reported on huge tmpfs, I believe its find_lock_entry()
has been at similar risk; but huge tmpfs does not rely on khugepaged
for its normal working nearly so much as READ_ONLY_THP_FOR_FS does.
