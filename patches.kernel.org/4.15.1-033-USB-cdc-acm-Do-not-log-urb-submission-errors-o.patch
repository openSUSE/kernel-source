Subject: [PATCH] USB: cdc-acm: Do not log urb submission errors on disconnect
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.1
Git-commit: f0386c083c2ce85284dc0b419d7b89c8e567c09f

commit f0386c083c2ce85284dc0b419d7b89c8e567c09f upstream.

When disconnected sometimes the cdc-acm driver logs errors like these:

[20278.039417] cdc_acm 2-2:2.1: urb 9 failed submission with -19
[20278.042924] cdc_acm 2-2:2.1: urb 10 failed submission with -19
[20278.046449] cdc_acm 2-2:2.1: urb 11 failed submission with -19
[20278.049920] cdc_acm 2-2:2.1: urb 12 failed submission with -19
[20278.053442] cdc_acm 2-2:2.1: urb 13 failed submission with -19
[20278.056915] cdc_acm 2-2:2.1: urb 14 failed submission with -19
[20278.060418] cdc_acm 2-2:2.1: urb 15 failed submission with -19

Silence these by not logging errors when the result is -ENODEV.
