Subject: [PATCH] tcp_cubic: fix incorrect HyStart round start detection
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.13
Git-commit: 25c1a9ca53db5780757e7f53e688b8f916821baa

[ Upstream commit 25c1a9ca53db5780757e7f53e688b8f916821baa ]

I noticed that HyStart incorrectly marks the start of rounds,
leading to inaccurate measurements of ACK train lengths and
resetting the `ca->sample_cnt` variable. This inaccuracy can impact
HyStart's functionality in terminating exponential cwnd growth during
Slow-Start, potentially degrading TCP performance.

The issue arises because the changes introduced in commit 4e1fddc98d25
("tcp_cubic: fix spurious Hystart ACK train detections for not-cwnd-limited flows")
moved the caller of the `bictcp_hystart_reset` function inside the `hystart_update` function.
This modification added an additional condition for triggering the caller,
requiring that (tcp_snd_cwnd(tp) >= hystart_low_window) must also
be satisfied before invoking `bictcp_hystart_reset`.

This fix ensures that `bictcp_hystart_reset` is correctly called
at the start of a new round, regardless of the congestion window size.
This is achieved by moving the condition
(tcp_snd_cwnd(tp) >= hystart_low_window)
from before calling `bictcp_hystart_reset` to after it.

I tested with a client and a server connected through two Linux software routers.
In this setup, the minimum RTT was 150 ms, the bottleneck bandwidth was 50 Mbps,
and the bottleneck buffer size was 1 BDP, calculated as (50M / 1514 / 8) * 0.150 = 619 packets.
I conducted the test twice, transferring data from the server to the client for 1.5 seconds.
Before the patch was applied, HYSTART-DELAY stopped the exponential growth of cwnd when
cwnd = 516, and the bottleneck link was not yet saturated (516 < 619).
After the patch was applied, HYSTART-ACK-TRAIN stopped the exponential growth of cwnd when
cwnd = 632, and the bottleneck link was saturated (632 > 619).
In this test, applying the patch resulted in 300 KB more data delivered.
