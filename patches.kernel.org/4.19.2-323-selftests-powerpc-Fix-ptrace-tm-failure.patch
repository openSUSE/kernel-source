Subject: [PATCH] selftests/powerpc: Fix ptrace tm failure
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.2
Git-commit: 48dc0ef19044bfb69193302fbe3a834e3331b7ae

commit 48dc0ef19044bfb69193302fbe3a834e3331b7ae upstream.

Test ptrace-tm-spd-gpr fails on current kernel (4.19) due to a segmentation
fault that happens on the child process prior to setting cptr[2] = 1. This
causes the parent process to wait forever at 'while (!pptr[2])' and the test to
be killed by the test harness framework by timeout, thus, failing.

The segmentation fault happens because of a inline assembly being
generated as:

	0x10000355c <tm_spd_gpr+492>    lfs    f0, 0(0)

This is reading memory position 0x0 and causing the segmentation fault.

This code is being generated by ASM_LOAD_FPR_SINGLE_PRECISION(flt_4), where
flt_4 is passed to the inline assembly block as:

	[flt_4] "r" (&d)

Since the inline assembly 'r' constraint means any GPR, gpr0 is being
chosen, thus causing this issue when issuing a Load Floating-Point Single
instruction.

This patch simply changes the constraint to 'b', which specify that this
register will be used as base, and r0 is not allowed to be used, avoiding
this issue.

Other than that, removing flt_2 register from the input operands, since it
is not used by the inline assembly code at all.
