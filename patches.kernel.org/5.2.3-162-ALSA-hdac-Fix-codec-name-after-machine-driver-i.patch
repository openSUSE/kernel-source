Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hdac: Fix codec name after machine driver is unloaded
 and reloaded
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

[ Upstream commit 8a5b0177a7f6099ff534a4d9ce72673af5c3cade ]

Currently on each driver reload internal counter is being increased. It
causes failure to enumerate driver devices, as they have hardcoded:
.codec_name = "ehdaudio0D2",
As there is currently no devices with multiple hda codecs and there is
currently no established way to reliably differentiate, between them,
always assign bus->idx = 0;

This fixes a problem when we unload and reload machine driver idx gets
incremented, so .codec_name would've needed to be set to "ehdaudio1D2"
after first reload and so on.
