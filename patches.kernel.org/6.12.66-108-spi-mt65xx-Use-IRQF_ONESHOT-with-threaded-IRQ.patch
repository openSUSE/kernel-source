Subject: [PATCH] spi: mt65xx: Use IRQF_ONESHOT with threaded IRQ
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.66
Git-commit: 8c04b77f87e6e321ae6acd28ce1de5553916153f

[ Upstream commit 8c04b77f87e6e321ae6acd28ce1de5553916153f ]

This driver is migrated to use threaded IRQ since commit 5972eb05ca32
("spi: spi-mt65xx: Use threaded interrupt for non-SPIMEM transfer"), and
we almost always want to disable the interrupt line to avoid excess
interrupts while the threaded handler is processing SPI transfer.
Use IRQF_ONESHOT for that purpose.

In practice, we see MediaTek devices show SPI transfer timeout errors
when communicating with ChromeOS EC in certain scenarios, and with
IRQF_ONESHOT, the issue goes away.
