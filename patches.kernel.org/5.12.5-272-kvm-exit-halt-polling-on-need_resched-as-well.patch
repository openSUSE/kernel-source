Subject: [PATCH] kvm: exit halt polling on need_resched() as well
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.5
Git-commit: 262de4102c7bb8e59f26a967a8ffe8cce85cc537

commit 262de4102c7bb8e59f26a967a8ffe8cce85cc537 upstream.

single_task_running() is usually more general than need_resched()
but CFS_BANDWIDTH throttling will use resched_task() when there
is just one task to get the task to block. This was causing
long-need_resched warnings and was likely allowing VMs to
overrun their quota when halt polling.
