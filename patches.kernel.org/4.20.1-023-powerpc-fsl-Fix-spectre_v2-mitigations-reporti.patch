Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/fsl: Fix spectre_v2 mitigations reporting
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.1
Git-commit: 7d8bad99ba5a22892f0cad6881289fdc3875a930

commit 7d8bad99ba5a22892f0cad6881289fdc3875a930 upstream.

Currently for CONFIG_PPC_FSL_BOOK3E the spectre_v2 file is incorrect:

  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spectre_v2
  "Mitigation: Software count cache flush"

Which is wrong. Fix it to report vulnerable for now.

Fixes: ee13cb249fab ("powerpc/64s: Add support for software count cache flush")
