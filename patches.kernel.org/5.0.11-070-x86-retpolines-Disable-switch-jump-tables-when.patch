Subject: [PATCH] x86/retpolines: Disable switch jump tables when retpolines

commit a9d57ef15cbe327fe54416dd194ee0ea66ae53a4 upstream.

Commit ce02ef06fcf7 ("x86, retpolines: Raise limit for generating indirect
calls from switch-case") raised the limit under retpolines to 20 switch
cases where gcc would only then start to emit jump tables, and therefore
effectively disabling the emission of slow indirect calls in this area.

After this has been brought to attention to gcc folks [0], Martin Liska
has then fixed gcc to align with clang by avoiding to generate switch jump
tables entirely under retpolines. This is taking effect in gcc starting
from stable version 8.4.0. Given kernel supports compilation with older
versions of gcc where the fix is not being available or backported anymore,
we need to keep the extra KBUILD_CFLAGS around for some time and generally
set the -fno-jump-tables to align with what more recent gcc is doing
automatically today.

More than 20 switch cases are not expected to be fast-path critical, but
it would still be good to align with gcc behavior for versions < 8.4.0 in
order to have consistency across supported gcc versions. vmlinux size is
slightly growing by 0.27% for older gcc. This flag is only set to work
around affected gcc, no change for clang.
