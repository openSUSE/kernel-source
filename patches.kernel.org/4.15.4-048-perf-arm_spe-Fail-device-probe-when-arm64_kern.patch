Subject: [PATCH] perf: arm_spe: Fail device probe when
 arm64_kernel_unmapped_at_el0()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.4
Git-commit: ed6cfd54cc9bde19f19ee15b660712ba99a2e8cf

Commit 7a4a0c1555b8 upstream.

When running with the kernel unmapped whilst at EL0, the virtually-addressed
SPE buffer is also unmapped, which can lead to buffer faults if userspace
profiling is enabled and potentially also when writing back kernel samples
unless an expensive drain operation is performed on exception return.

For now, fail the SPE driver probe when arm64_kernel_unmapped_at_el0().
