Subject: [PATCH] selftests/Makefile: include $(INSTALL_DEP_TARGETS) in clean
 target to clean net/lib dependency
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.8
Git-commit: d3f7457da7b9527a06dbcbfaf666aa51ac2eeb53

[ Upstream commit d3f7457da7b9527a06dbcbfaf666aa51ac2eeb53 ]

The selftests 'make clean' does not clean the net/lib because it only
processes $(TARGETS) and ignores $(INSTALL_DEP_TARGETS). This leaves
compiled objects in net/lib after cleaning, requiring manual cleanup.

Include $(INSTALL_DEP_TARGETS) in clean target to ensure net/lib
dependency is properly cleaned.
