Subject: [PATCH] firmware: cleanup FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL message
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.6
Git-commit: 0946b2fb38fdb6585a5ac3ca84ac73924f645952

commit 0946b2fb38fdb6585a5ac3ca84ac73924f645952 upstream.

The help for FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL still references the firmware_install
command that was recently removed by commit 5620a0d1aacd ("firmware:
delete in-kernel firmware").

Clean up the message to direct the user to their distribution's
linux-firmware package, and remove any reference to firmware being
included in the kernel source tree.

Fixes: 5620a0d1aacd ("firmware: delete in-kernel firmware").
