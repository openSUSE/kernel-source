Subject: [PATCH] PCI/AER: Report non-fatal errors only to the affected
 endpoint
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.9
Git-commit: 86acc790717fb60fb51ea3095084e331d8711c74

[ Upstream commit 86acc790717fb60fb51ea3095084e331d8711c74 ]

Previously, if an non-fatal error was reported by an endpoint, we
called report_error_detected() for the endpoint, every sibling on the
bus, and their descendents.  If any of them did not implement the
.error_detected() method, do_recovery() failed, leaving all these
devices unrecovered.

For example, the system described in the bugzilla below has two devices:

  0000:74:02.0 [19e5:a230] SAS controller, driver has .error_detected()
  0000:74:03.0 [19e5:a235] SATA controller, driver lacks .error_detected()

When a device such as 74:02.0 reported a non-fatal error, do_recovery()
failed because 74:03.0 lacked an .error_detected() method.  But per PCIe
r3.1, sec 6.2.2.2.2, such an error does not compromise the Link and
does not affect 74:03.0:

  Non-fatal errors are uncorrectable errors which cause a particular
  transaction to be unreliable but the Link is otherwise fully functional.
  Isolating Non-fatal from Fatal errors provides Requester/Receiver logic
  in a device or system management software the opportunity to recover from
  the error without resetting the components on the Link and disturbing
  other transactions in progress.  Devices not associated with the
  transaction in error are not impacted by the error.

Report non-fatal errors only to the endpoint that reported them.  We really
want to check for AER_NONFATAL here, but the current code structure doesn't
allow that.  Looking for pci_channel_io_normal is the best we can do now.
