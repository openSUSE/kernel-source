Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: Try to sanitize bogus DPLL state left over by
 broken SNB BIOSen

commit d028a646e84b9b131e4ff2cb5bbdd3825d141028 upstream.

Certain SNB machines (eg. ASUS K53SV) seem to have a broken BIOS
which misprograms the hardware badly when encountering a suitably
high resolution display. The programmed pipe timings are somewhat
bonkers and the DPLL is totally misprogrammed (P divider == 0).
That will result in atomic commit timeouts as apparently the pipe
is sufficiently stuck to not signal vblank interrupts.

IIRC something like this was also observed on some other SNB
machine years ago (might have been a Dell XPS 8300) but a BIOS
update cured it. Sadly looks like this was never fixed for the
ASUS K53SV as the latest BIOS (K53SV.320 11/11/2011) is still
broken.

The quickest way to deal with this seems to be to shut down
the pipe+ports+DPLL. Unfortunately doing this during the
normal sanitization phase isn't quite soon enough as we
already spew several WARNs about the bogus hardware state.
But it's better than hanging the boot for a few dozen seconds.
Since this is limited to a few old machines it doesn't seem
entirely worthwile to try and rework the readout+sanitization
code to handle it more gracefully.
