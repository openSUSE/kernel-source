Subject: [PATCH] selftests/lkdtm: Avoid needing explicit sub-shell
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.2
Git-commit: 04831e892b41618914b2123ae3b4fa77252e8656

commit 04831e892b41618914b2123ae3b4fa77252e8656 upstream.

Some environments do not set $SHELL when running tests. There's no
need to use $SHELL here anyway, since "cat" can be used to receive any
delivered signals from the kernel. Additionally avoid using bash-isms
in the command, and record stderr for posterity.
