Subject: [PATCH] soc: qcom: rpmh-rsc: Allow using free WAKE TCS for active
 request
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.10
Git-commit: 38427e5a47bf83299da930bd474c6cb2632ad810

commit 38427e5a47bf83299da930bd474c6cb2632ad810 upstream.

When there are more than one WAKE TCS available and there is no dedicated
ACTIVE TCS available, invalidating all WAKE TCSes and waiting for current
transfer to complete in first WAKE TCS blocks using another free WAKE TCS
to complete current request.

Remove rpmh_rsc_invalidate() to happen from tcs_write() when WAKE TCSes
is re-purposed to be used for Active mode. Clear only currently used
WAKE TCS's register configuration.
