Subject: [PATCH] HID: i2c-hid: Fix "incomplete report" noise
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.6
Git-commit: ef6eaf27274c0351f7059163918f3795da13199c

commit ef6eaf27274c0351f7059163918f3795da13199c upstream.

Commit ac75a041048b ("HID: i2c-hid: fix size check and type usage") started
writing messages when the ret_size is <= 2 from i2c_master_recv.  However, my
device i2c-DLL07D1 returns 2 for a short period of time (~0.5s) after I stop
moving the pointing stick or touchpad.  It varies, but you get ~50 messages
each time which spams the log hard.

[  95.925055] i2c_hid i2c-DLL07D1:01: i2c_hid_get_input: incomplete report (83/2)

This has also been observed with a i2c-ALP0017.

[ 1781.266353] i2c_hid i2c-ALP0017:00: i2c_hid_get_input: incomplete report (30/2)

Only print the message when ret_size is totally invalid and less than 2 to cut
down on the log spam.
