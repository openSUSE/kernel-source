Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sa8540p-ride: correct name of
 remoteproc_nsp0 firmware
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.2.12
Git-commit: b891251b40d4dc4cfd28341f62f6784c02ad3a78

[ Upstream commit b891251b40d4dc4cfd28341f62f6784c02ad3a78 ]

The cdsp.mbn firmware that's referenced in sa8540p-ride.dts is actually
named cdsp0.mbn in the deliverables from Qualcomm. Let's go ahead and
correct the name to match what's in Qualcomm's deliverable.
