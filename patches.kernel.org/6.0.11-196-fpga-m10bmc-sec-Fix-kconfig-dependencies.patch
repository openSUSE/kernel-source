Subject: [PATCH] fpga: m10bmc-sec: Fix kconfig dependencies
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.11
Git-commit: dfd10332596ef11ceafd29c4e21b4117be423fc4

commit dfd10332596ef11ceafd29c4e21b4117be423fc4 upstream.

The secure update driver depends on the firmware-upload functionality of
the firmware-loader. The firmware-loader is carried in the firmware-class
driver which is enabled with the tristate CONFIG_FW_LOADER option. The
firmware-upload functionality is included in the firmware-class driver if
the bool FW_UPLOAD config is set.

The current dependency statement, "depends on FW_UPLOAD", is not adequate
because it does not implicitly turn on FW_LOADER. Instead of adding a
dependency, follow the convention used by drivers that require the
FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER functionality of the firmware-loader by using
select for both FW_LOADER and FW_UPLOAD.
