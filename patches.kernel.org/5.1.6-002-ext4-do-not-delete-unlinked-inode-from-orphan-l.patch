Subject: [PATCH] ext4: do not delete unlinked inode from orphan list on failed
 truncate
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.6
Git-commit: ee0ed02ca93ef1ecf8963ad96638795d55af2c14

commit ee0ed02ca93ef1ecf8963ad96638795d55af2c14 upstream.

It is possible that unlinked inode enters ext4_setattr() (e.g. if
somebody calls ftruncate(2) on unlinked but still open file). In such
case we should not delete the inode from the orphan list if truncate
fails. Note that this is mostly a theoretical concern as filesystem is
corrupted if we reach this path anyway but let's be consistent in our
orphan handling.
