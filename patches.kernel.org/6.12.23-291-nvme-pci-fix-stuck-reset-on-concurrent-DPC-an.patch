Subject: [PATCH] nvme-pci: fix stuck reset on concurrent DPC and HP
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.23
Git-commit: 3f674e7b670b7b7d9261935820e4eba3c059f835

[ Upstream commit 3f674e7b670b7b7d9261935820e4eba3c059f835 ]

The PCIe error handling has the nvme driver quiesce the device, attempt
to restart it, then wait for that restart to complete.

A PCIe DPC event also toggles the PCIe link. If the slot doesn't have
out-of-band presence detection, this will trigger a pciehp
re-enumeration.

The error handling that calls nvme_error_resume is holding the device
lock while this happens. This lock blocks pciehp's request to disconnect
the driver from proceeding.

Meanwhile the nvme's reset can't make forward progress because its
device isn't there anymore with outstanding IO, and the timeout handler
won't do anything to fix it because the device is undergoing error
handling.

End result: deadlocked.

Fix this by having the timeout handler short cut the disabling for a
disconnected PCIe device. The downside is that we're relying on an IO
timeout to clean up this mess, which could be a minute by default.
