Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845: Limit ipa iommu streams
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.4
Git-commit: 95e6f8467c83c4074a6f6b47bad00653549ff90a

[ Upstream commit 95e6f8467c83c4074a6f6b47bad00653549ff90a ]

The Android and Windows firmware does not accept the use of 3 as a mask
to cover the IPA streams. But with 0x721 being related to WiFi and 0x723
being unsed the mapping can be reduced to just cover 0x720 and 0x722,
which is accepted.
