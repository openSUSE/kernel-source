Subject: [PATCH] riscv: evaluate put_user() arg before enabling user access
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.12
Git-commit: 285a76bb2cf51b0c74c634f2aaccdb93e1f2a359

commit 285a76bb2cf51b0c74c634f2aaccdb93e1f2a359 upstream.

The <asm/uaccess.h> header has a problem with put_user(a, ptr) if
the 'a' is not a simple variable, such as a function. This can lead
to the compiler producing code as so:

1:	enable_user_access()
2:	evaluate 'a' into register 'r'
3:	put 'r' to 'ptr'
4:	disable_user_acess()

The issue is that 'a' is now being evaluated with the user memory
protections disabled. So we try and force the evaulation by assigning
'x' to __val at the start, and hoping the compiler barriers in
 enable_user_access() do the job of ordering step 2 before step 1.

This has shown up in a bug where 'a' sleeps and thus schedules out
and loses the SR_SUM flag. This isn't sufficient to fully fix, but
should reduce the window of opportunity. The first instance of this
we found is in scheudle_tail() where the code does:

$ less -N kernel/sched/core.c

4263  if (current->set_child_tid)
4264         put_user(task_pid_vnr(current), current->set_child_tid);

Here, the task_pid_vnr(current) is called within the block that has
enabled the user memory access. This can be made worse with KASAN
which makes task_pid_vnr() a rather large call with plenty of
opportunity to sleep.
