Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915/gt: Close race between enable_breadcrumbs and
 cancel_breadcrumbs
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.15
Git-commit: e4747cb3ec3c232d65c84cbe77633abd5871fda3

commit e4747cb3ec3c232d65c84cbe77633abd5871fda3 upstream.

If we enable_breadcrumbs for a request while that request is being
removed from HW; we may see that the request is active as we take the
ce->signal_lock and proceed to attach the request to ce->signals.
However, during unsubmission after marking the request as inactive, we
see that the request has not yet been added to ce->signals and so skip
the removal. Pull the check during cancel_breadcrumbs under the same
spinlock as enabling so that we the two tests are consistent in
enable/cancel.

Otherwise, we may insert a request onto ce->signals that we expect should
not be there:

  intel_context_remove_breadcrumbs:488 GEM_BUG_ON(!__i915_request_is_complete(rq))

While updating, we can note that we are always called with
irqs-disabled, due to the engine->active.lock being held at the single
caller, and so remove the irqsave/restore making it symmetric to
enable_breadcrumbs.
