Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: connect: fix fallback note due to OoO
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.59
Git-commit: 63c643aa7b7287fdbb0167063785f89ece3f000f

commit 63c643aa7b7287fdbb0167063785f89ece3f000f upstream.

The "fallback due to TCP OoO" was never printed because the stat_ooo_now
variable was checked twice: once in the parent if-statement, and one in
the child one. The second condition was then always true then, and the
'else' branch was never taken.

The idea is that when there are more ACK + MP_CAPABLE than expected, the
test either fails if there was no out of order packets, or a notice is
printed.

Fixes: 69ca3d29a755 ("mptcp: update selftest for fallback due to OoO")
