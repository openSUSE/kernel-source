Subject: [PATCH] fs/proc/task_mmu.c: fix Locked field in /proc/pid/smaps*
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.7
Git-commit: e70cc2bd579e8a9d6d153762f0fe294d0e652ff0

commit e70cc2bd579e8a9d6d153762f0fe294d0e652ff0 upstream.

Thomas reports:
 "While looking around in /proc on my v4.14.52 system I noticed that all
  processes got a lot of "Locked" memory in /proc/*/smaps. A lot more
  memory than a regular user can usually lock with mlock().

  Commit 493b0e9d945f (in v4.14-rc1) seems to have changed the behavior
  of "Locked".

  Before that commit the code was like this. Notice the VM_LOCKED check.

           (vma->vm_flags & VM_LOCKED) ?
                (unsigned long)(mss.pss >> (10 + PSS_SHIFT)) : 0);

  After that commit Locked is now the same as Pss:

	  (unsigned long)(mss->pss >> (10 + PSS_SHIFT)));

  This looks like a mistake."

Indeed, the commit has added mss->pss_locked with the correct value that
depends on VM_LOCKED, but forgot to actually use it.  Fix it.
