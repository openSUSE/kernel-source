Subject: [PATCH] sched/pelt: Relax the sync of util_sum with util_avg
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.16.5
Git-commit: 98b0d890220d45418cfbc5157b3382e6da5a12ab

[ Upstream commit 98b0d890220d45418cfbc5157b3382e6da5a12ab ]

Rick reported performance regressions in bugzilla because of cpu frequency
being lower than before:
    https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215045

He bisected the problem to:
commit 1c35b07e6d39 ("sched/fair: Ensure _sum and _avg values stay consistent")

This commit forces util_sum to be synced with the new util_avg after
removing the contribution of a task and before the next periodic sync. By
doing so util_sum is rounded to its lower bound and might lost up to
LOAD_AVG_MAX-1 of accumulated contribution which has not yet been
reflected in util_avg.

Instead of always setting util_sum to the low bound of util_avg, which can
significantly lower the utilization of root cfs_rq after propagating the
change down into the hierarchy, we revert the change of util_sum and
propagate the difference.

In addition, we also check that cfs's util_sum always stays above the
lower bound for a given util_avg as it has been observed that
sched_entity's util_sum is sometimes above cfs one.

Fixes: 1c35b07e6d39 ("sched/fair: Ensure _sum and _avg values stay consistent")
