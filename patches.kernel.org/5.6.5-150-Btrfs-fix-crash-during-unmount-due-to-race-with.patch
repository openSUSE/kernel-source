Subject: [PATCH] Btrfs: fix crash during unmount due to race with delayed
 inode workers
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.5
Git-commit: f0cc2cd70164efe8f75c5d99560f0f69969c72e4

commit f0cc2cd70164efe8f75c5d99560f0f69969c72e4 upstream.

During unmount we can have a job from the delayed inode items work queue
still running, that can lead to at least two bad things:

1) A crash, because the worker can try to create a transaction just
   after the fs roots were freed;

2) A transaction leak, because the worker can create a transaction
   before the fs roots are freed and just after we committed the last
   transaction and after we stopped the transaction kthread.

A stack trace example of the crash:

                                                                                                           the root is not in
                                                                                                           the radix tree
                                                                                                           anymore

If the worker is able to call btrfs_join_transaction() before the unmount
task frees the fs roots, we end up leaking a transaction and all its
resources, since after the call to btrfs_commit_super() and stopping the
transaction kthread, we don't expect to have any transaction open anymore.

When this situation happens the worker has a delayed node that has no
more items to run, since the task calling btrfs_run_delayed_items(),
which is doing a transaction commit, picks the same node and runs all
its items first.

We can not wait for the worker to complete when running delayed items
through btrfs_run_delayed_items(), because we call that function in
several phases of a transaction commit, and that could cause a deadlock
because the worker calls btrfs_join_transaction() and the task doing the
transaction commit may have already set the transaction state to
TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_DOING.

Also it's not possible to get into a situation where only some of the
items of a delayed node are added to the fs/subvolume tree in the current
transaction and the remaining ones in the next transaction, because when
running the items of a delayed inode we lock its mutex, effectively
waiting for the worker if the worker is running the items of the delayed
node already.

Since this can only cause issues when unmounting a filesystem, fix it in
a simple way by waiting for any jobs on the delayed workers queue before
calling btrfs_commit_supper() at close_ctree(). This works because at this
point no one can call btrfs_btree_balance_dirty() or
btrfs_balance_delayed_items(), and if we end up waiting for any worker to
complete, btrfs_commit_super() will commit the transaction created by the
worker.
