Subject: [PATCH] ext4: fix interaction between i_size, fallocate, and delalloc
 after a crash
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.3
Git-commit: 51e3ae81ec58e95f10a98ef3dd6d7bce5d8e35a2

commit 51e3ae81ec58e95f10a98ef3dd6d7bce5d8e35a2 upstream.

If there are pending writes subject to delayed allocation, then i_size
will show size after the writes have completed, while i_disksize
contains the value of i_size on the disk (since the writes have not
been persisted to disk).

If fallocate(2) is called with the FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE flag, either
with or without the FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE flag set, and the new size
after the fallocate(2) is between i_size and i_disksize, then after a
crash, if a journal commit has resulted in the changes made by the
fallocate() call to be persisted after a crash, but the delayed
allocation write has not resolved itself, i_size would not be updated,
and this would cause the following e2fsck complaint:

Inode 12, end of extent exceeds allowed value
	(logical block 33, physical block 33441, len 7)

This can only take place on a sparse file, where the fallocate(2) call
is allocating blocks in a range which is before a pending delayed
allocation write which is extending i_size.  Since this situation is
quite rare, and the window in which the crash must take place is
typically < 30 seconds, in practice this condition will rarely happen.

Nevertheless, it can be triggered in testing, and in particular by
xfstests generic/456.
