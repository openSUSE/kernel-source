Subject: [PATCH] afs: Alter dirty range encoding in page->private
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.5
Git-commit: 65dd2d6072d393a3aa14ded8afa9a12f27d9c8ad

[ Upstream commit 65dd2d6072d393a3aa14ded8afa9a12f27d9c8ad ]

Currently, page->private on an afs page is used to store the range of
dirtied data within the page, where the range includes the lower bound, but
excludes the upper bound (e.g. 0-1 is a range covering a single byte).

This, however, requires a superfluous bit for the last-byte bound so that
on a 4KiB page, it can say 0-4096 to indicate the whole page, the idea
being that having both numbers the same would indicate an empty range.
This is unnecessary as the PG_private bit is clear if it's an empty range
(as is PG_dirty).

Alter the way the dirty range is encoded in page->private such that the
upper bound is reduced by 1 (e.g. 0-0 is then specified the same single
byte range mentioned above).

Applying this to both bounds frees up two bits, one of which can be used in
a future commit.

This allows the afs filesystem to be compiled on ppc32 with 64K pages;
without this, the following warnings are seen:

../fs/afs/internal.h: In function 'afs_page_dirty_to':
../fs/afs/internal.h:881:15: warning: right shift count >= width of type [-Wshift-count-overflow]
  881 |  return (priv >> __AFS_PAGE_PRIV_SHIFT) & __AFS_PAGE_PRIV_MASK;
      |               ^~
../fs/afs/internal.h: In function 'afs_page_dirty':
../fs/afs/internal.h:886:28: warning: left shift count >= width of type [-Wshift-count-overflow]
  886 |  return ((unsigned long)to << __AFS_PAGE_PRIV_SHIFT) | from;
      |                            ^~
