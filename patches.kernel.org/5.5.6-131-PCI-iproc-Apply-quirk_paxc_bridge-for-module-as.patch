Subject: [PATCH] PCI: iproc: Apply quirk_paxc_bridge() for module as well as
 built-in
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.6
Git-commit: 574f29036fce385e28617547955dd6911d375025

[ Upstream commit 574f29036fce385e28617547955dd6911d375025 ]

Previously quirk_paxc_bridge() was applied when the iproc driver was
built-in, but not when it was compiled as a module.

This happened because it was under #ifdef CONFIG_PCIE_IPROC_PLATFORM:
PCIE_IPROC_PLATFORM=y causes CONFIG_PCIE_IPROC_PLATFORM to be defined, but
PCIE_IPROC_PLATFORM=m causes CONFIG_PCIE_IPROC_PLATFORM_MODULE to be
defined.

Move quirk_paxc_bridge() to pcie-iproc.c and drop the #ifdef so the quirk
is always applied, whether iproc is built-in or a module.

[bhelgaas: commit log, move to pcie-iproc.c, not pcie-iproc-platform.c]
