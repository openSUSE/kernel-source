Subject: [PATCH] blk-mq: remove stale comment for
 blk_mq_sched_mark_restart_hctx
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: c31e76bcc379182fe67a82c618493b7b8868c672

[ Upstream commit c31e76bcc379182fe67a82c618493b7b8868c672 ]

Commit 97889f9ac24f8 ("blk-mq: remove synchronize_rcu() from
blk_mq_del_queue_tag_set()") remove handle of TAG_SHARED in restart,
then shared_hctx_restart counted for how many hardware queues are marked
for restart is removed too.
Remove the stale comment that we still count hardware queues need restart.
