Subject: [PATCH] dmaengine: Store module owner in dma_device struct
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.6
Git-commit: dae7a589c18a4d979d5f14b09374e871b995ceb1

[ Upstream commit dae7a589c18a4d979d5f14b09374e871b995ceb1 ]

dma_chan_to_owner() dereferences the driver from the struct device to
obtain the owner and call module_[get|put](). However, if the backing
device is unbound before the dma_device is unregistered, the driver
will be cleared and this will cause a NULL pointer dereference.

Instead, store a pointer to the owner module in the dma_device struct
so the module reference can be properly put when the channel is put, even
if the backing device was destroyed first.

This change helps to support a safer unbind of DMA engines.
If the dma_device is unregistered in the driver's remove function,
there's no guarantee that there are no existing clients and a users
action may trigger the WARN_ONCE in dma_async_device_unregister()
which is unlikely to leave the system in a consistent state.
Instead, a better approach is to allow the backing driver to go away
and fail any subsequent requests to it.
