Subject: [PATCH] dm cache metadata: save in-core policy_hint_size to on-disk
 superblock
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.7
Git-commit: fd2fa95416188a767a63979296fa3e169a9ef5ec

commit fd2fa95416188a767a63979296fa3e169a9ef5ec upstream.

policy_hint_size starts as 0 during __write_initial_superblock().  It
isn't until the policy is loaded that policy_hint_size is set in-core
(cmd->policy_hint_size).  But it never got recorded in the on-disk
superblock because __commit_transaction() didn't deal with transfering
the in-core cmd->policy_hint_size to the on-disk superblock.

The in-core cmd->policy_hint_size gets initialized by metadata_open()'s
__begin_transaction_flags() which re-reads all superblock fields.
Because the superblock's policy_hint_size was never properly stored, when
the cache was created, hints_array_available() would always return false
when re-activating a previously created cache.  This means
__load_mappings() always considered the hints invalid and never made use
of the hints (these hints served to optimize).

Another detremental side-effect of this oversight is the cache_check
utility would fail with: "invalid hint width: 0"
