Subject: [PATCH] ata: libata: disallow dev-initiated LPM transitions to

commit 24e0e61db3cb86a66824531989f1df80e0939f26 upstream.

In AHCI 1.3.1, the register description for CAP.SSC:
"When cleared to ‘0’, software must not allow the HBA to initiate
transitions to the Slumber state via agressive link power management nor
the PxCMD.ICC field in each port, and the PxSCTL.IPM field in each port
must be programmed to disallow device initiated Slumber requests."

In AHCI 1.3.1, the register description for CAP.PSC:
"When cleared to ‘0’, software must not allow the HBA to initiate
transitions to the Partial state via agressive link power management nor
the PxCMD.ICC field in each port, and the PxSCTL.IPM field in each port
must be programmed to disallow device initiated Partial requests."

Ensure that we always set the corresponding bits in PxSCTL.IPM, such that
a device is not allowed to initiate transitions to power states which are
unsupported by the HBA.

DevSleep is always initiated by the HBA, however, for completeness, set the
corresponding bit in PxSCTL.IPM such that agressive link power management
cannot transition to DevSleep if DevSleep is not supported.

sata_link_scr_lpm() is used by libahci, ata_piix and libata-pmp.
However, only libahci has the ability to read the CAP/CAP2 register to see
if these features are supported. Therefore, in order to not introduce any
regressions on ata_piix or libata-pmp, create flags that indicate that the
respective feature is NOT supported. This way, the behavior for ata_piix
and libata-pmp should remain unchanged.

This change is based on a patch originally submitted by Runa Guo-oc.
