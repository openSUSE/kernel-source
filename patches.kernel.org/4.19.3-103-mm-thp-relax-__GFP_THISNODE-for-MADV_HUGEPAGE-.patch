commit ac5b2c18911ffe95c08d69273917f90212cf5659 upstream.

THP allocation might be really disruptive when allocated on NUMA system
with the local node full or hard to reclaim.  Stefan has posted an
allocation stall report on 4.12 based SLES kernel which suggests the
same issue:

  kvm: page allocation stalls for 194572ms, order:9, mode:0x4740ca(__GFP_HIGHMEM|__GFP_IO|__GFP_FS|__GFP_COMP|__GFP_NOMEMALLOC|__GFP_HARDWALL|__GFP_THISNODE|__GFP_MOVABLE|__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM), nodemask=(null)

The defrag mode is "madvise" and from the above report it is clear that
the THP has been allocated for MADV_HUGEPAGA vma.

Andrea has identified that the main source of the problem is
__GFP_THISNODE usage:

: The problem is that direct compaction combined with the NUMA
: __GFP_THISNODE logic in mempolicy.c is telling reclaim to swap very
: hard the local node, instead of failing the allocation if there's no
: THP available in the local node.
:
: Such logic was ok until __GFP_THISNODE was added to the THP allocation
: path even with MPOL_DEFAULT.
:
: The idea behind the __GFP_THISNODE addition, is that it is better to
: provide local memory in PAGE_SIZE units than to use remote NUMA THP
: backed memory. That largely depends on the remote latency though, on
: threadrippers for example the overhead is relatively low in my
: experience.
:
: The combination of __GFP_THISNODE and __GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM results in
: extremely slow qemu startup with vfio, if the VM is larger than the
: size of one host NUMA node. This is because it will try very hard to
: unsuccessfully swapout get_user_pages pinned pages as result of the
: __GFP_THISNODE being set, instead of falling back to PAGE_SIZE
: allocations and instead of trying to allocate THP on other nodes (it
: would be even worse without vfio type1 GUP pins of course, except it'd
: be swapping heavily instead).

Fix this by removing __GFP_THISNODE for THP requests which are
requesting the direct reclaim.  This effectivelly reverts 5265047ac301
on the grounds that the zone/node reclaim was known to be disruptive due
to premature reclaim when there was memory free.  While it made sense at
the time for HPC workloads without NUMA awareness on rare machines, it
was ultimately harmful in the majority of cases.  The existing behaviour
is similar, if not as widespare as it applies to a corner case but
crucially, it cannot be tuned around like zone_reclaim_mode can.  The
default behaviour should always be to cause the least harm for the
common case.

If there are specialised use cases out there that want zone_reclaim_mode
in specific cases, then it can be built on top.  Longterm we should
consider a memory policy which allows for the node reclaim like behavior
for the specific memory ranges which would allow a

Mel said:

: Both patches look correct to me but I'm responding to this one because
: it's the fix.  The change makes sense and moves further away from the
: severe stalling behaviour we used to see with both THP and zone reclaim
: mode.
:
: I put together a basic experiment with usemem configured to reference a
: buffer multiple times that is 80% the size of main memory on a 2-socket
: box with symmetric node sizes and defrag set to "always".  The defrag
: setting is not the default but it would be functionally similar to
: accessing a buffer with madvise(MADV_HUGEPAGE).  Usemem is configured to
: reference the buffer multiple times and while it's not an interesting
: workload, it would be expected to complete reasonably quickly as it fits
: within memory.  The results were;
:
: usemem
:                                   vanilla           noreclaim-v1
: Amean     Elapsd-1       42.78 (   0.00%)       26.87 (  37.18%)
: Amean     Elapsd-3       27.55 (   0.00%)        7.44 (  73.00%)
: Amean     Elapsd-4        5.72 (   0.00%)        5.69 (   0.45%)
:
: This shows the elapsed time in seconds for 1 thread, 3 threads and 4
: threads referencing buffers 80% the size of memory.  With the patches
: applied, it's 37.18% faster for the single thread and 73% faster with two
: threads.  Note that 4 threads showing little difference does not indicate
: the problem is related to thread counts.  It's simply the case that 4
: threads gets spread so their workload mostly fits in one node.

: Writes from reclaim context is never good but the patch eliminates it.

: We should never have default behaviour to thrash the system for such a
: basic workload.  If zone reclaim mode behaviour is ever desired but on a
: single task instead of a global basis then the sensible option is to build
: a mempolicy that enforces that behaviour.

This was a severe regression compared to previous kernels that made
important workloads unusable and it starts when __GFP_THISNODE was
added to THP allocations under MADV_HUGEPAGE.  It is not a significant
risk to go to the previous behavior before __GFP_THISNODE was added, it
worked like that for years.

This was simply an optimization to some lucky workloads that can fit in
a single node, but it ended up breaking the VM for others that can't
possibly fit in a single node, so going back is safe.
