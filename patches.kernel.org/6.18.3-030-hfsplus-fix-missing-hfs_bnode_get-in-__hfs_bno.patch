Subject: [PATCH] hfsplus: fix missing hfs_bnode_get() in __hfs_bnode_create
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.3
Git-commit: 152af114287851583cf7e0abc10129941f19466a

[ Upstream commit 152af114287851583cf7e0abc10129941f19466a ]

When sync() and link() are called concurrently, both threads may
enter hfs_bnode_find() without finding the node in the hash table
and proceed to create it.

Thread A:
  hfsplus_write_inode()
    -> hfsplus_write_system_inode()
      -> hfs_btree_write()
        -> hfs_bnode_find(tree, 0)
          -> __hfs_bnode_create(tree, 0)

Thread B:
  hfsplus_create_cat()
    -> hfs_brec_insert()
      -> hfs_bnode_split()
        -> hfs_bmap_alloc()
          -> hfs_bnode_find(tree, 0)
            -> __hfs_bnode_create(tree, 0)

In this case, thread A creates the bnode, sets refcnt=1, and hashes it.
Thread B also tries to create the same bnode, notices it has already
been inserted, drops its own instance, and uses the hashed one without
getting the node.

```

	node2 = hfs_bnode_findhash(tree, cnid);
	if (!node2) {                                 <- Thread A
		hash = hfs_bnode_hash(cnid);
		node->next_hash = tree->node_hash[hash];
		tree->node_hash[hash] = node;
		tree->node_hash_cnt++;
	} else {                                      <- Thread B
		spin_unlock(&tree->hash_lock);
		kfree(node);
		wait_event(node2->lock_wq,
			!test_bit(HFS_BNODE_NEW, &node2->flags));
		return node2;
	}
```

However, hfs_bnode_find() requires each call to take a reference.
Here both threads end up setting refcnt=1. When they later put the node,
this triggers:

BUG_ON(!atomic_read(&node->refcnt))

In this scenario, Thread B in fact finds the node in the hash table
rather than creating a new one, and thus must take a reference.

Fix this by calling hfs_bnode_get() when reusing a bnode newly created by
another thread to ensure the refcount is updated correctly.

A similar bug was fixed in HFS long ago in commit
a9dc087fd3c4 ("fix missing hfs_bnode_get() in __hfs_bnode_create")
but the same issue remained in HFS+ until now.
