Subject: [PATCH] wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: don't skip link selection
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.3
Git-commit: 46144103ace2863e26f4e911aa45200753b7dbca

[ Upstream commit 46144103ace2863e26f4e911aa45200753b7dbca ]

If we exit EMLSR due to a IWL_MVM_ESR_EXIT*, a MLO scan followed by a
link selection is scheduled with a delay of 30 seconds.
If during that 30 seconds EMLSR was blocked and unblocked
(IWL_MVM_ESR_BLOCKED*), we would still want to get the needed data from
the MLO scan and select link accordingly, and not return immediately to
EMLSR.
