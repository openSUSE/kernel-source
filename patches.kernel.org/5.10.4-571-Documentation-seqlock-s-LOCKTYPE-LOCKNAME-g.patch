Subject: [PATCH] Documentation: seqlock: s/LOCKTYPE/LOCKNAME/g
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.4
Git-commit: cf48647243cc28d15280600292db5777592606c5

commit cf48647243cc28d15280600292db5777592606c5 upstream.

Sequence counters with an associated write serialization lock are called
seqcount_LOCKNAME_t. Fix the documentation accordingly.

While at it, remove a paragraph that inappropriately discussed a
seqlock.h implementation detail.
