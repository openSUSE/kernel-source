Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: hikey: Revert "Enable HS200 mode on eMMC"
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.2
Git-commit: 8d26c1390aec795d492b8de5e4437751e8805a1d

commit 8d26c1390aec795d492b8de5e4437751e8805a1d upstream.

This reverts commit abd7d0972a192ee653efc7b151a6af69db58f2bb. This
change was already partially reverted by John Stultz in
commit 9c6d26df1fae ("arm64: dts: hikey: Fix eMMC corruption regression").

This change appears to cause controller resets and block read failures
which prevents successful booting on some hikey boards.
