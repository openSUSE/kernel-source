Subject: [PATCH] Revert "x86/apic: Include the LDR when clearing out APIC
 registers"
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.14
Git-commit: 950b07c14e8c59444e2359f15fd70ed5112e11a0

[ Upstream commit 950b07c14e8c59444e2359f15fd70ed5112e11a0 ]

This reverts commit 558682b5291937a70748d36fd9ba757fb25b99ae.

Chris Wilson reports that it breaks his CPU hotplug test scripts.  In
particular, it breaks offlining and then re-onlining the boot CPU, which
we treat specially (and the BIOS does too).

The symptoms are that we can offline the CPU, but it then does not come
back online again:

    smpboot: CPU 0 is now offline
    smpboot: Booting Node 0 Processor 0 APIC 0x0
    smpboot: do_boot_cpu failed(-1) to wakeup CPU#0

Thomas says he knows why it's broken (my personal suspicion: our magic
handling of the "cpu0_logical_apicid" thing), but for 5.3 the right fix
is to just revert it, since we've never touched the LDR bits before, and
it's not worth the risk to do anything else at this stage.

[ Hotpluging of the boot CPU is special anyway, and should be off by
  default. See the "BOOTPARAM_HOTPLUG_CPU0" config option and the
  cpu0_hotplug kernel parameter.

  In general you should not do it, and it has various known limitations
  (hibernate and suspend require the boot CPU, for example).

  But it should work, even if the boot CPU is special and needs careful
  treatment       - Linus ]
