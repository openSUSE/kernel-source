Subject: [PATCH] mm/gup: check every subpage of a compound page during
 isolation
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.5
Git-commit: 83c02c23d0747a7bdcd71f99a538aacec94b146c

[ Upstream commit 83c02c23d0747a7bdcd71f99a538aacec94b146c ]

When pages are isolated in check_and_migrate_movable_pages() we skip
compound number of pages at a time.  However, as Jason noted, it is not
necessary correct that pages[i] corresponds to the pages that we
skipped.  This is because it is possible that the addresses in this
range had split_huge_pmd()/split_huge_pud(), and these functions do not
update the compound page metadata.

The problem can be reproduced if something like this occurs:

1. User faulted huge pages.
2. split_huge_pmd() was called for some reason
3. User has unmapped some sub-pages in the range
4. User tries to longterm pin the addresses.

The resulting pages[i] might end-up having pages which are not compound
size page aligned.
