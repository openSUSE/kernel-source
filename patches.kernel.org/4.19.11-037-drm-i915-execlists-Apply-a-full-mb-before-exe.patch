Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915/execlists: Apply a full mb before execution for
 Braswell
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.11
Git-commit: cf66b8a0ba142fbd1bf10ac8f3ae92d1b0cb7b8f
Git-commit: 490b8c65b9db45896769e1095e78725775f47b3e

commit cf66b8a0ba142fbd1bf10ac8f3ae92d1b0cb7b8f upstream.

Braswell is really picky about having our writes posted to memory before
we execute or else the GPU may see stale values. A wmb() is insufficient
as it only ensures the writes are visible to other cores, we need a full
mb() to ensure the writes are in memory and visible to the GPU.

The most frequent failure in flushing before execution is that we see
stale PTE values and execute the wrong pages.
