Subject: [PATCH] perf: Add cond_resched() to task_function_call()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.3
Git-commit: 2ed6edd33a214bca02bd2b45e3fc3038a059436b

commit 2ed6edd33a214bca02bd2b45e3fc3038a059436b upstream.

Under rare circumstances, task_function_call() can repeatedly fail and
cause a soft lockup.

There is a slight race where the process is no longer running on the cpu
we targeted by the time remote_function() runs.  The code will simply
try again.  If we are very unlucky, this will continue to fail, until a
watchdog fires.  This can happen in a heavily loaded, multi-core virtual
machine.
