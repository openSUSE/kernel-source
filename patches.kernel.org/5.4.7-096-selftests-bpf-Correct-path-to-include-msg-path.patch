[ Upstream commit c588146378962786ddeec817f7736a53298a7b01 ]

The "path" buf is supposed to contain path + printf msg up to 24 bytes.
It will be cut anyway, but compiler generates truncation warns like:

"
samples/bpf/../../tools/testing/selftests/bpf/cgroup_helpers.c: In
function ‘setup_cgroup_environment’:
samples/bpf/../../tools/testing/selftests/bpf/cgroup_helpers.c:52:34:

[-Wformat-truncation=]

				  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

cgroup_path);
samples/bpf/../../tools/testing/selftests/bpf/cgroup_helpers.c:72:2:
note: ‘snprintf’ output between 24 and 4120 bytes into a destination

snprintf(path, sizeof(path), "%s/cgroup.subtree_control",
cgroup_path);
"

In order to avoid warns, lets decrease buf size for cgroup workdir on
24 bytes with assumption to include also "/cgroup.subtree_control" to
the address. The cut will never happen anyway.
