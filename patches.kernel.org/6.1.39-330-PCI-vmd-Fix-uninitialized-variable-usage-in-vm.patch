Subject: [PATCH] PCI: vmd: Fix uninitialized variable usage in
 vmd_enable_domain()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
References: bsc#1012628

[ Upstream commit 0c0206dc4f5ba2d18b15e24d2047487d6f73916b ]

The ret variable in the vmd_enable_domain() function was used
uninitialized when printing a warning message upon failure of
the pci_reset_bus() function.

Thus, fix the issue by assigning ret with the value returned from
pci_reset_bus() before referencing it in the warning message.

This was detected by Smatch:

  drivers/pci/controller/vmd.c:931 vmd_enable_domain() error: uninitialized symbol 'ret'.

[kwilczynski: drop the second patch from the series, add missing reported
by tag, commit log]
