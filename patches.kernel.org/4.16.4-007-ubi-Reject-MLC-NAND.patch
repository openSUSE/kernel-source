Subject: [PATCH] ubi: Reject MLC NAND
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.4
Git-commit: b5094b7f135be34630e3ea8a98fa215715d0f29d

commit b5094b7f135be34630e3ea8a98fa215715d0f29d upstream.

While UBI and UBIFS seem to work at first sight with MLC NAND, you will
most likely lose all your data upon a power-cut or due to read/write
disturb.
In order to protect users from bad surprises, refuse to attach to MLC
NAND.
