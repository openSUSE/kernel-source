Subject: [PATCH] bnxt_en: Ignore src port field in decap filter nodes
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.13
Git-commit: 479ca3bf91da971fcefc003cf5773e8d7db24794

[ Upstream commit 479ca3bf91da971fcefc003cf5773e8d7db24794 ]

The driver currently uses src port field (along with other fields) in the
decap tunnel key, while looking up and adding tunnel nodes. This leads to
redundant cfa_decap_filter_alloc() requests to the FW and flow-miss in the
flow engine. Fix this by ignoring the src port field in decap tunnel nodes.

Fixes: f484f6782e01 ("bnxt_en: add hwrm FW cmds for cfa_encap_record and decap_filter")
