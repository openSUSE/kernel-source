Subject: [PATCH] mm/gup: reorganize internal_get_user_pages_fast()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.4
Git-commit: c28b1fc70390df32e29991eedd52bd86e7aba080

[ Upstream commit c28b1fc70390df32e29991eedd52bd86e7aba080 ]

Patch series "Add a seqcount between gup_fast and copy_page_range()", v4.

As discussed and suggested by Linus use a seqcount to close the small race
between gup_fast and copy_page_range().

Ahmed confirms that raw_write_seqcount_begin() is the correct API to use
in this case and it doesn't trigger any lockdeps.

I was able to test it using two threads, one forking and the other using
ibv_reg_mr() to trigger GUP fast.  Modifying copy_page_range() to sleep
made the window large enough to reliably hit to test the logic.

This patch (of 2):

The next patch in this series makes the lockless flow a little more
complex, so move the entire block into a new function and remove a level
of indention.  Tidy a bit of cruft:

 - addr is always the same as start, so use start

 - Use the modern check_add_overflow() for computing end = start + len

 - nr_pinned/pages << PAGE_SHIFT needs the LHS to be unsigned long to
   avoid shift overflow, make the variables unsigned long to avoid coding
   casts in both places. nr_pinned was missing its cast

 - The handling of ret and nr_pinned can be streamlined a bit

No functional change.
