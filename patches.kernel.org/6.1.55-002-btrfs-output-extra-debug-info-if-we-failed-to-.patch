Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: output extra debug info if we failed to find an inline
 backref
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.55
Git-commit: 7f72f50547b7af4ddf985b07fc56600a4deba281

[ Upstream commit 7f72f50547b7af4ddf985b07fc56600a4deba281 ]

[BUG]
Syzbot reported several warning triggered inside
lookup_inline_extent_backref().

[CAUSE]
As usual, the reproducer doesn't reliably trigger locally here, but at
least we know the WARN_ON() is triggered when an inline backref can not
be found, and it can only be triggered when @insert is true. (I.e.
inserting a new inline backref, which means the backref should already
exist)

[ENHANCEMENT]
After the WARN_ON(), dump all the parameters and the extent tree
leaf to help debug.
