Subject: [PATCH] ARCv2: lib: memeset: fix doing prefetchw outside of buffer
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.6
Git-commit: e6a72b7daeeb521753803550f0ed711152bb2555

commit e6a72b7daeeb521753803550f0ed711152bb2555 upstream.

ARCv2 optimized memset uses PREFETCHW instruction for prefetching the
next cache line but doesn't ensure that the line is not past the end of
the buffer. PRETECHW changes the line ownership and marks it dirty,
which can cause issues in SMP config when next line was already owned by
other core. Fix the issue by avoiding the PREFETCHW

Some more details:

The current code has 3 logical loops (ignroing the unaligned part)
  (a) Big loop for doing aligned 64 bytes per iteration with PREALLOC
  (b) Loop for 32 x 2 bytes with PREFETCHW
  (c) any left over bytes

loop (a) was already eliding the last 64 bytes, so PREALLOC was
safe. The fix was removing PREFETCW from (b).

Another potential issue (applicable to configs with 32 or 128 byte L1
cache line) is that PREALLOC assumes 64 byte cache line and may not do
the right thing specially for 32b. While it would be easy to adapt,
there are no known configs with those lie sizes, so for now, just
compile out PREALLOC in such cases.
