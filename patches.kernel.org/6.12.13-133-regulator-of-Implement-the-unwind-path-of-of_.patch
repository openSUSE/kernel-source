Subject: [PATCH] regulator: of: Implement the unwind path of
 of_regulator_match()
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.13
Git-commit: dddca3b2fc676113c58b04aaefe84bfb958ac83e

[ Upstream commit dddca3b2fc676113c58b04aaefe84bfb958ac83e ]

of_regulator_match() does not release the OF node reference in the error
path, resulting in an OF node leak. Therefore, call of_node_put() on the
obtained nodes before returning the EINVAL error.

Since it is possible that some drivers call this function and do not
exit on failure, such as s2mps11_pmic_driver, clear the init_data and
of_node in the error path.

This was reported by an experimental verification tool that I am
developing. As I do not have access to actual devices nor the QEMU board
configuration to test drivers that call this function, no runtime test
was able to be performed.
