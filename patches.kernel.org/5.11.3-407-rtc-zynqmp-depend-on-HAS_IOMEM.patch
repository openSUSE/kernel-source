Subject: [PATCH] rtc: zynqmp: depend on HAS_IOMEM
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.3
Git-commit: ddd0521549a975e6148732d6ca6b89ffa862c0e5

[ Upstream commit ddd0521549a975e6148732d6ca6b89ffa862c0e5 ]

The Xilinx zynqmp RTC driver makes use of IOMEM functions like
devm_platform_ioremap_resource(), which are only available if
CONFIG_HAS_IOMEM is defined.

This causes the driver not to be enable under make ARCH=um allyesconfig,
even though it won't build.

By adding a dependency on HAS_IOMEM, the driver will not be enabled on
architectures which don't support it.
