Subject: [PATCH] Revert "net/smc: fix a NULL pointer dereference"
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.9
Git-commit: 5369ead83f5aff223b6418c99cb1fe9a8f007363

[ Upstream commit 5369ead83f5aff223b6418c99cb1fe9a8f007363 ]

This reverts commit e183d4e414b64711baf7a04e214b61969ca08dfa.

Because of recent interactions with developers from @umn.edu, all
commits from them have been recently re-reviewed to ensure if they were
correct or not.

Upon review, this commit was found to be incorrect for the reasons
below, so it must be reverted.  It will be fixed up "correctly" in a
later kernel change.

The original commit causes a memory leak and does not properly fix the
issue it claims to fix.  I will send a follow-on patch to resolve this
properly.
