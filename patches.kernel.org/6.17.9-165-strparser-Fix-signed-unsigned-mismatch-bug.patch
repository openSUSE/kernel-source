Subject: [PATCH] strparser: Fix signed/unsigned mismatch bug
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.9
Git-commit: 4da4e4bde1c453ac5cc2dce5def81d504ae257ee

commit 4da4e4bde1c453ac5cc2dce5def81d504ae257ee upstream.

The `len` member of the sk_buff is an unsigned int. This is cast to
`ssize_t` (a signed type) for the first sk_buff in the comparison,
but not the second sk_buff. On 32-bit systems, this can result in
an integer underflow for certain values because unsigned arithmetic
is being used.

This appears to be an oversight: if the intention was to use unsigned
arithmetic, then the first cast would have been omitted. The change
ensures both len values are cast to `ssize_t`.

The underflow causes an issue with ktls when multiple TLS PDUs are
included in a single TCP segment. The mainline kernel does not use
strparser for ktls anymore, but this is still useful for other
features that still use strparser, and for backporting.
