Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: fix hang during unmount when stopping a space reclaim
 worker

commit a362bb864b8db4861977d00bd2c3222503ccc34b upstream.

Often when running generic/562 from fstests we can hang during unmount,
resulting in a trace like this:

  Sep 07 11:55:32 debian9 kernel:  </TASK>

What happens is the following:

1) The cleaner kthread tries to start a transaction to delete an unused
   block group, but the metadata reservation can not be satisfied right
   away, so a reservation ticket is created and it starts the async
   metadata reclaim task (fs_info->async_reclaim_work);

2) Writeback for all the filler inodes with an i_size of 2K starts
   (generic/562 creates a lot of 2K files with the goal of filling
   metadata space). We try to create an inline extent for them, but we
   fail when trying to insert the inline extent with -ENOSPC (at
   cow_file_range_inline()) - since this is not critical, we fallback
   to non-inline mode (back to cow_file_range()), reserve extents, create
   extent maps and create the ordered extents;

3) An unmount starts, enters close_ctree();

4) The async reclaim task is flushing stuff, entering the flush states one
   by one, until it reaches RUN_DELAYED_IPUTS. There it runs all current
   delayed iputs.

   After running the delayed iputs and before calling
   btrfs_wait_on_delayed_iputs(), one or more ordered extents complete,
   and btrfs_add_delayed_iput() is called for each one through
   btrfs_finish_ordered_io() -> btrfs_put_ordered_extent(). This results
   in bumping fs_info->nr_delayed_iputs from 0 to some positive value.

   So the async reclaim task blocks at btrfs_wait_on_delayed_iputs() waiting
   for fs_info->nr_delayed_iputs to become 0;

5) The current transaction is committed by the transaction kthread, we then
   start unpinning extents and end up calling btrfs_try_granting_tickets()
   through unpin_extent_range(), since we released some space.
   This results in satisfying the ticket created by the cleaner kthread at
   step 1, waking up the cleaner kthread;

6) At close_ctree() we ask the cleaner kthread to park;

7) The cleaner kthread starts the transaction, deletes the unused block
   group, and then calls kthread_should_park(), which returns true, so it
   parks. And at this point we have the delayed iputs added by the
   completion of the ordered extents still pending;

8) Then later at close_ctree(), when we call:

       cancel_work_sync(&fs_info->async_reclaim_work);

   We hang forever, since the cleaner was parked and no one else can run
   delayed iputs after that, while the reclaim task is waiting for the
   remaining delayed iputs to be completed.

Fix this by waiting for all ordered extents to complete and running the
delayed iputs before attempting to stop the async reclaim tasks. Note that
we can not wait for ordered extents with btrfs_wait_ordered_roots() (or
other similar functions) because that waits for the BTRFS_ORDERED_COMPLETE
flag to be set on an ordered extent, but the delayed iput is added after
that, when doing the final btrfs_put_ordered_extent(). So instead wait for
the work queues used for executing ordered extent completion to be empty,
which works because we do the final put on an ordered extent at
btrfs_finish_ordered_io() (while we are in the unmount context).
