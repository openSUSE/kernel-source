Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: drop reset from rk3576 i2c9 node
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.9
Git-commit: 264152a97edf9f1b7ed5372e4033e46108e41422

[ Upstream commit 264152a97edf9f1b7ed5372e4033e46108e41422 ]

The reset property is not part of the binding, so drop it.
It is also not used by the driver, so it was likely copied
from some vendor-kernel node.
