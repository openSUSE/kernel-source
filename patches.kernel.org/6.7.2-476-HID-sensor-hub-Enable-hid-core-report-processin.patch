Subject: [PATCH] HID: sensor-hub: Enable hid core report processing for all
 devices
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.2
Git-commit: 8e2f79f41a5d1b1a4a53ec524eb7609ca89f3c65

commit 8e2f79f41a5d1b1a4a53ec524eb7609ca89f3c65 upstream.

After the commit 666cf30a589a ("HID: sensor-hub: Allow multi-function
sensor devices") hub devices are claimed by hidraw driver in hid_connect().
This causes stoppping of processing HID reports by hid core due to
optimization.

In such case, the hid-sensor-custom driver cannot match a known custom
sensor in hid_sensor_custom_get_known() because it try to check custom
properties which weren't filled from the report because hid core didn't
parsed it.

As result, custom sensors like hinge angle sensor and LISS sensors
don't work.

Mark the sensor hub devices claimed by some driver to avoid hidraw-related
optimizations.
