 Client Drivers
 --------------
 
-A client driver typically only has to conditionally change its DMA map
-routine to use the mapping function :c:func:`pci_p2pdma_map_sg()` instead
-of the usual :c:func:`dma_map_sg()` function. Memory mapped in this
-way does not need to be unmapped.
-
-The client may also, optionally, make use of
-:c:func:`is_pci_p2pdma_page()` to determine when to use the P2P mapping
-functions and when to use the regular mapping functions. In some
-situations, it may be more appropriate to use a flag to indicate a
-given request is P2P memory and map appropriately. It is important to
-ensure that struct pages that back P2P memory stay out of code that
-does not have support for them as other code may treat the pages as
-regular memory which may not be appropriate.
+A client driver only has to use the mapping API :c:func:`dma_map_sg()`
+and :c:func:`dma_unmap_sg()` functions as usual, and the implementation
+will do the right thing for the P2P capable memory.
