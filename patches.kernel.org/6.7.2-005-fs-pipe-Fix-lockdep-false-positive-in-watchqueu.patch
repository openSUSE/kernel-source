Subject: [PATCH] fs/pipe: Fix lockdep false-positive in watchqueue
 pipe_write()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.2
Git-commit: 055ca83559912f2cfd91c9441427bac4caf3c74e

[ Upstream commit 055ca83559912f2cfd91c9441427bac4caf3c74e ]

When you try to splice between a normal pipe and a notification pipe,
get_pipe_info(..., true) fails, so splice() falls back to treating the
notification pipe like a normal pipe - so we end up in
iter_file_splice_write(), which first locks the input pipe, then calls
vfs_iter_write(), which locks the output pipe.

Lockdep complains about that, because we're taking a pipe lock while
already holding another pipe lock.

I think this probably (?) can't actually lead to deadlocks, since you'd
need another way to nest locking a normal pipe into locking a
watch_queue pipe, but the lockdep annotations don't make that clear.

Bail out earlier in pipe_write() for notification pipes, before taking
the pipe lock.
