Subject: [PATCH] kernfs: wire up ->splice_read and ->splice_write
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.11
Git-commit: f2d6c2708bd84ca953fa6b6ca5717e79eb0140c7

commit f2d6c2708bd84ca953fa6b6ca5717e79eb0140c7 upstream.

Wire up the splice_read and splice_write methods to the default
helpers using ->read_iter and ->write_iter now that those are
implemented for kernfs.  This restores support to use splice and
sendfile on kernfs files.

Fixes: 36e2c7421f02 ("fs: don't allow splice read/write without explicit ops")
