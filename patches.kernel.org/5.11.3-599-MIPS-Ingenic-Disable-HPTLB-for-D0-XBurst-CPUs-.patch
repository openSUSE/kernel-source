Subject: [PATCH] MIPS: Ingenic: Disable HPTLB for D0 XBurst CPUs too
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.3
Git-commit: a5360958a3cd1d876aae1f504ae014658513e1af

commit a5360958a3cd1d876aae1f504ae014658513e1af upstream.

The JZ4760 has the HPTLB as well, but has a XBurst CPU with a D0 CPUID.

Disable the HPTLB for all XBurst CPUs with a D0 CPUID. In the case where
there is no HPTLB (e.g. for older SoCs), this won't have any side
effect.

Fixes: b02efeb05699 ("MIPS: Ingenic: Disable abandoned HPTLB function.")
