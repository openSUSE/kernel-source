Subject: [PATCH] mtd: spi-nor: intel-spi: Avoid crossing 4K address boundary
 on read/write
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.4
Git-commit: 2b75ebeea6f4937d4d05ec4982c471cef9a29b7f

commit 2b75ebeea6f4937d4d05ec4982c471cef9a29b7f upstream.

It was observed that reads crossing 4K address boundary are failing.

This limitation is mentioned in Intel documents:

Intel(R) 9 Series Chipset Family Platform Controller Hub (PCH) Datasheet:

"5.26.3 Flash Access
Program Register Access:
* Program Register Accesses are not allowed to cross a 4 KB boundary..."

Enhanced Serial Peripheral Interface (eSPI)
Interface Base Specification (for Client and Server Platforms):

"5.1.4 Address
For other memory transactions, the address may start or end at any byte
boundary. However, the address and payload length combination must not
cross the naturally aligned address boundary of the corresponding Maximum
Payload Size. It must not cross a 4 KB address boundary."

Avoid this by splitting an operation crossing the boundary into two
operations.
