-
-1  Overview
-===========
-
-The sk98lin driver supports the Marvell Yukon and SysKonnect 
-SK-98xx/SK-95xx compliant Gigabit Ethernet Adapter on Linux. It has 
-been tested with Linux on Intel/x86 machines.
-***
-
-
-2  Required Files
-=================
-
-The linux kernel source.
-No additional files required.
-***
-
-
-3  Installation
-===============
-
-It is recommended to download the latest version of the driver from the 
-SysKonnect web site www.syskonnect.com. If you have downloaded the latest
-driver, the Linux kernel has to be patched before the driver can be 
-installed. For details on how to patch a Linux kernel, refer to the 
-patch.txt file.
-
-3.1  Driver Installation
-------------------------
-
-The following steps describe the actions that are required to install
-the driver and to start it manually. These steps should be carried
-out for the initial driver setup. Once confirmed to be ok, they can
-be included in the system start.
-
-NOTE 1: To perform the following tasks you need 'root' access.
-
-NOTE 2: In case of problems, please read the section "Troubleshooting" 
-        below.
-
-The driver can either be integrated into the kernel or it can be compiled 
-as a module. Select the appropriate option during the kernel 
-configuration.
-
-Compile/use the driver as a module
-----------------------------------
-To compile the driver, go to the directory /usr/src/linux and
-execute the command "make menuconfig" or "make xconfig" and proceed as 
-follows:
-
-To integrate the driver permanently into the kernel, proceed as follows:
-
-1. Select the menu "Network device support" and then "Ethernet(1000Mbit)"
-2. Mark "Marvell Yukon Chipset / SysKonnect SK-98xx family support" 
-   with (*) 
-3. Build a new kernel when the configuration of the above options is 
-   finished.
-4. Install the new kernel.
-5. Reboot your system.
-
-To use the driver as a module, proceed as follows:
-
-1. Enable 'loadable module support' in the kernel.
-2. For automatic driver start, enable the 'Kernel module loader'.
-3. Select the menu "Network device support" and then "Ethernet(1000Mbit)"
-4. Mark "Marvell Yukon Chipset / SysKonnect SK-98xx family support" 
-   with (M)
-5. Execute the command "make modules".
-6. Execute the command "make modules_install".
-   The appropriate modules will be installed.
-7. Reboot your system.
-
-
-Load the module manually
-------------------------
-To load the module manually, proceed as follows:
-
-1. Enter "modprobe sk98lin".
-2. If a Marvell Yukon or SysKonnect SK-98xx adapter is installed in 
-   your computer and you have a /proc file system, execute the command:
-   "ls /proc/net/sk98lin/" 
-   This should produce an output containing a line with the following 
-   format:
-   eth0   eth1  ...
-   which indicates that your adapter has been found and initialized.
-   
-   NOTE 1: If you have more than one Marvell Yukon or SysKonnect SK-98xx 
-           adapter installed, the adapters will be listed as 'eth0', 
-                   'eth1', 'eth2', etc.
-                   For each adapter, repeat steps 3 and 4 below.
-
-   NOTE 2: If you have other Ethernet adapters installed, your Marvell
-           Yukon or SysKonnect SK-98xx adapter will be mapped to the 
-                   next available number, e.g. 'eth1'. The mapping is executed 
-                   automatically.
-           The module installation message (displayed either in a system
-           log file or on the console) prints a line for each adapter 
-           found containing the corresponding 'ethX'.
-
-3. Select an IP address and assign it to the respective adapter by 
-   entering:
-   ifconfig eth0 <ip-address>
-   With this command, the adapter is connected to the Ethernet. 
-   
-   SK-98xx Gigabit Ethernet Server Adapters: The yellow LED on the adapter 
-   is now active, the link status LED of the primary port is active and 
-   the link status LED of the secondary port (on dual port adapters) is 
-   blinking (if the ports are connected to a switch or hub).
-   SK-98xx V2.0 Gigabit Ethernet Adapters: The link status LED is active.
-   In addition, you will receive a status message on the console stating
-   "ethX: network connection up using port Y" and showing the selected 
-   connection parameters (x stands for the ethernet device number 
-   (0,1,2, etc), y stands for the port name (A or B)).
-
-   NOTE: If you are in doubt about IP addresses, ask your network
-         administrator for assistance.
-  
-4. Your adapter should now be fully operational.
-   Use 'ping <otherstation>' to verify the connection to other computers 
-   on your network.
-5. To check the adapter configuration view /proc/net/sk98lin/[devicename].
-   For example by executing:    
-   "cat /proc/net/sk98lin/eth0" 
-
-Unload the module
------------------
-To stop and unload the driver modules, proceed as follows:
-
-1. Execute the command "ifconfig eth0 down".
-2. Execute the command "rmmod sk98lin".
-
-3.2  Inclusion of adapter at system start
------------------------------------------
-
-Since a large number of different Linux distributions are 
-available, we are unable to describe a general installation procedure
-for the driver module.
-Because the driver is now integrated in the kernel, installation should
-be easy, using the standard mechanism of your distribution.
-Refer to the distribution's manual for installation of ethernet adapters.
-
-***
-
-4  Driver Parameters
-====================
-
-Parameters can be set at the command line after the module has been 
-loaded with the command 'modprobe'.
-In some distributions, the configuration tools are able to pass parameters
-to the driver module.
-
-If you use the kernel module loader, you can set driver parameters
-in the file /etc/modprobe.conf (or /etc/modules.conf in 2.4 or earlier).
-To set the driver parameters in this file, proceed as follows:
-
-1. Insert a line of the form :
-   options sk98lin ...
-   For "...", the same syntax is required as described for the command
-   line parameters of modprobe below.
-2. To activate the new parameters, either reboot your computer
-   or 
-   unload and reload the driver.
-   The syntax of the driver parameters is:
-
-        modprobe sk98lin parameter=value1[,value2[,value3...]]
-
-   where value1 refers to the first adapter, value2 to the second etc.
-
-NOTE: All parameters are case sensitive. Write them exactly as shown 
-      below.
-
-Example:
-Suppose you have two adapters. You want to set auto-negotiation
-on the first adapter to ON and on the second adapter to OFF.
-You also want to set DuplexCapabilities on the first adapter
-to FULL, and on the second adapter to HALF.
-Then, you must enter:
-
-        modprobe sk98lin AutoNeg_A=On,Off DupCap_A=Full,Half
-
-NOTE: The number of adapters that can be configured this way is
-      limited in the driver (file skge.c, constant SK_MAX_CARD_PARAM).
-      The current limit is 16. If you happen to install
-      more adapters, adjust this and recompile.
-
-
-4.1  Per-Port Parameters
-------------------------
-
-These settings are available for each port on the adapter.
-In the following description, '?' stands for the port for
-which you set the parameter (A or B).
-
-Speed
------
-Parameter:    Speed_?
-Values:       10, 100, 1000, Auto
-Default:      Auto
-
-This parameter is used to set the speed capabilities. It is only valid 
-for the SK-98xx V2.0 copper adapters.
-Usually, the speed is negotiated between the two ports during link 
-establishment. If this fails, a port can be forced to a specific setting
-with this parameter.
-
-Auto-Negotiation
-----------------
-Parameter:    AutoNeg_?
-Values:       On, Off, Sense
-Default:      On
-  
-The "Sense"-mode automatically detects whether the link partner supports
-auto-negotiation or not.
-
-Duplex Capabilities
--------------------
-Parameter:    DupCap_?
-Values:       Half, Full, Both
-Default:      Both
-
-This parameters is only relevant if auto-negotiation for this port is 
-not set to "Sense". If auto-negotiation is set to "On", all three values
-are possible. If it is set to "Off", only "Full" and "Half" are allowed.
-This parameter is useful if your link partner does not support all
-possible combinations.
-
-Flow Control
-------------
-Parameter:    FlowCtrl_?
-Values:       Sym, SymOrRem, LocSend, None
-Default:      SymOrRem
-
-This parameter can be used to set the flow control capabilities the 
-port reports during auto-negotiation. It can be set for each port 
-individually.
-Possible modes:
-   -- Sym      = Symmetric: both link partners are allowed to send 
-                  PAUSE frames
-   -- SymOrRem = SymmetricOrRemote: both or only remote partner 
-                  are allowed to send PAUSE frames
-   -- LocSend  = LocalSend: only local link partner is allowed 
-                  to send PAUSE frames
-   -- None     = no link partner is allowed to send PAUSE frames
-  
-NOTE: This parameter is ignored if auto-negotiation is set to "Off".
-
-Role in Master-Slave-Negotiation (1000Base-T only)
---------------------------------------------------
-Parameter:    Role_?
-Values:       Auto, Master, Slave
-Default:      Auto
-
-This parameter is only valid for the SK-9821 and SK-9822 adapters.
-For two 1000Base-T ports to communicate, one must take the role of the
-master (providing timing information), while the other must be the 
-slave. Usually, this is negotiated between the two ports during link 
-establishment. If this fails, a port can be forced to a specific setting
-with this parameter.
-
-
-4.2  Adapter Parameters
------------------------
-
-Connection Type (SK-98xx V2.0 copper adapters only)
----------------
-Parameter:    ConType
-Values:       Auto, 100FD, 100HD, 10FD, 10HD
-Default:      Auto
-
-The parameter 'ConType' is a combination of all five per-port parameters
-within one single parameter. This simplifies the configuration of both ports
-of an adapter card! The different values of this variable reflect the most 
-meaningful combinations of port parameters.
-
-The following table shows the values of 'ConType' and the corresponding
-combinations of the per-port parameters:
-
-    ConType   |  DupCap   AutoNeg   FlowCtrl   Role             Speed
-    ----------+------------------------------------------------------
-    Auto      |  Both     On        SymOrRem   Auto             Auto
-    100FD     |  Full     Off       None       Auto (ignored)   100
-    100HD     |  Half     Off       None       Auto (ignored)   100
-    10FD      |  Full     Off       None       Auto (ignored)   10
-    10HD      |  Half     Off       None       Auto (ignored)   10
-
-Stating any other port parameter together with this 'ConType' variable
-will result in a merged configuration of those settings. This due to 
-the fact, that the per-port parameters (e.g. Speed_? ) have a higher
-priority than the combined variable 'ConType'.
-
-NOTE: This parameter is always used on both ports of the adapter card.
-
-Interrupt Moderation
---------------------
-Parameter:    Moderation
-Values:       None, Static, Dynamic
-Default:      None
-
-Interrupt moderation is employed to limit the maximum number of interrupts
-the driver has to serve. That is, one or more interrupts (which indicate any
-transmit or receive packet to be processed) are queued until the driver 
-processes them. When queued interrupts are to be served, is determined by the
-'IntsPerSec' parameter, which is explained later below.
-
-Possible modes:
-
-   -- None - No interrupt moderation is applied on the adapter card. 
-      Therefore, each transmit or receive interrupt is served immediately
-      as soon as it appears on the interrupt line of the adapter card.
-
-   -- Static - Interrupt moderation is applied on the adapter card. 
-      All transmit and receive interrupts are queued until a complete
-      moderation interval ends. If such a moderation interval ends, all
-      queued interrupts are processed in one big bunch without any delay.
-      The term 'static' reflects the fact, that interrupt moderation is
-      always enabled, regardless how much network load is currently 
-      passing via a particular interface. In addition, the duration of
-      the moderation interval has a fixed length that never changes while
-      the driver is operational.
-
-   -- Dynamic - Interrupt moderation might be applied on the adapter card,
-      depending on the load of the system. If the driver detects that the
-      system load is too high, the driver tries to shield the system against 
-      too much network load by enabling interrupt moderation. If - at a later
-      time - the CPU utilization decreases again (or if the network load is 
-      negligible) the interrupt moderation will automatically be disabled.
-
-Interrupt moderation should be used when the driver has to handle one or more
-interfaces with a high network load, which - as a consequence - leads also to a
-high CPU utilization. When moderation is applied in such high network load 
-situations, CPU load might be reduced by 20-30%.
-
-NOTE: The drawback of using interrupt moderation is an increase of the round-
-trip-time (RTT), due to the queueing and serving of interrupts at dedicated
-moderation times.
-
-Interrupts per second
----------------------
-Parameter:    IntsPerSec
-Values:       30...40000 (interrupts per second)
-Default:      2000
-
-This parameter is only used if either static or dynamic interrupt moderation
-is used on a network adapter card. Using this parameter if no moderation is
-applied will lead to no action performed.
-
-This parameter determines the length of any interrupt moderation interval. 
-Assuming that static interrupt moderation is to be used, an 'IntsPerSec' 
-parameter value of 2000 will lead to an interrupt moderation interval of
-500 microseconds. 
-
-NOTE: The duration of the moderation interval is to be chosen with care.
-At first glance, selecting a very long duration (e.g. only 100 interrupts per 
-second) seems to be meaningful, but the increase of packet-processing delay 
-is tremendous. On the other hand, selecting a very short moderation time might
-compensate the use of any moderation being applied.
-
-
-Preferred Port
---------------
-Parameter:    PrefPort
-Values:       A, B
-Default:      A
-
-This is used to force the preferred port to A or B (on dual-port network 
-adapters). The preferred port is the one that is used if both are detected
-as fully functional.
-
-RLMT Mode (Redundant Link Management Technology)
-------------------------------------------------
-Parameter:    RlmtMode
-Values:       CheckLinkState,CheckLocalPort, CheckSeg, DualNet
-Default:      CheckLinkState
-
-RLMT monitors the status of the port. If the link of the active port 
-fails, RLMT switches immediately to the standby link. The virtual link is 
-maintained as long as at least one 'physical' link is up. 
-
-Possible modes:
-
-   -- CheckLinkState - Check link state only: RLMT uses the link state
-      reported by the adapter hardware for each individual port to 
-      determine whether a port can be used for all network traffic or 
-      not.
-
-   -- CheckLocalPort - In this mode, RLMT monitors the network path 
-      between the two ports of an adapter by regularly exchanging packets
-      between them. This mode requires a network configuration in which 
-      the two ports are able to "see" each other (i.e. there must not be 
-      any router between the ports).
-
-   -- CheckSeg - Check local port and segmentation: This mode supports the
-      same functions as the CheckLocalPort mode and additionally checks 
-      network segmentation between the ports. Therefore, this mode is only
-      to be used if Gigabit Ethernet switches are installed on the network
-      that have been configured to use the Spanning Tree protocol. 
-
-   -- DualNet - In this mode, ports A and B are used as separate devices. 
-      If you have a dual port adapter, port A will be configured as eth0 
-      and port B as eth1. Both ports can be used independently with 
-      distinct IP addresses. The preferred port setting is not used. 
-      RLMT is turned off.
-   
-NOTE: RLMT modes CLP and CLPSS are designed to operate in configurations 
-      where a network path between the ports on one adapter exists. 
-      Moreover, they are not designed to work where adapters are connected
-      back-to-back.
-***
-
-
-5  Large Frame Support
-======================
-
-The driver supports large frames (also called jumbo frames). Using large 
-frames can result in an improved throughput if transferring large amounts 
-of data.
-To enable large frames, set the MTU (maximum transfer unit) of the 
-interface to the desired value (up to 9000), execute the following 
-command:
-      ifconfig eth0 mtu 9000
-This will only work if you have two adapters connected back-to-back
-or if you use a switch that supports large frames. When using a switch, 
-it should be configured to allow large frames and auto-negotiation should  
-be set to OFF. The setting must be configured on all adapters that can be 
-reached by the large frames. If one adapter is not set to receive large 
-frames, it will simply drop them.
-
-You can switch back to the standard ethernet frame size by executing the 
-following command:
-      ifconfig eth0 mtu 1500
-
-To permanently configure this setting, add a script with the 'ifconfig' 
-line to the system startup sequence (named something like "S99sk98lin" 
-in /etc/rc.d/rc2.d).
-***
-
-
-6  VLAN and Link Aggregation Support (IEEE 802.1, 802.1q, 802.3ad)
-==================================================================
-
-The Marvell Yukon/SysKonnect Linux drivers are able to support VLAN and 
-Link Aggregation according to IEEE standards 802.1, 802.1q, and 802.3ad. 
-These features are only available after installation of open source 
-modules available on the Internet:
-For VLAN go to: http://www.candelatech.com/~greear/vlan.html
-For Link Aggregation go to: http://www.st.rim.or.jp/~yumo
-
-NOTE: SysKonnect GmbH does not offer any support for these open source 
-      modules and does not take the responsibility for any kind of 
-      failures or problems arising in connection with these modules.
-
-NOTE: Configuring Link Aggregation on a SysKonnect dual link adapter may 
-      cause problems when unloading the driver.
-
-
-7  Troubleshooting
-==================
-
-If any problems occur during the installation process, check the 
-following list:
-
-
-Problem:  The SK-98xx adapter cannot be found by the driver.
-Solution: In /proc/pci search for the following entry:
-             'Ethernet controller: SysKonnect SK-98xx ...'
-          If this entry exists, the SK-98xx or SK-98xx V2.0 adapter has 
-          been found by the system and should be operational.
-          If this entry does not exist or if the file '/proc/pci' is not 
-          found, there may be a hardware problem or the PCI support may 
-          not be enabled in your kernel.
-          The adapter can be checked using the diagnostics program which 
-          is available on the SysKonnect web site:
-          www.syskonnect.com
-          
-          Some COMPAQ machines have problems dealing with PCI under Linux.
-          This problem is described in the 'PCI howto' document
-          (included in some distributions or available from the
-          web, e.g. at 'www.linux.org'). 
-
-
-Problem:  Programs such as 'ifconfig' or 'route' cannot be found or the 
-          error message 'Operation not permitted' is displayed.
-Reason:   You are not logged in as user 'root'.
-Solution: Logout and login as 'root' or change to 'root' via 'su'.
-
-
-Problem:  Upon use of the command 'ping <address>' the message
-          "ping: sendto: Network is unreachable" is displayed.
-Reason:   Your route is not set correctly.
-Solution: If you are using RedHat, you probably forgot to set up the 
-          route in the 'network configuration'.
-          Check the existing routes with the 'route' command and check 
-          if an entry for 'eth0' exists, and if so, if it is set correctly.
-
-
-Problem:  The driver can be started, the adapter is connected to the 
-          network, but you cannot receive or transmit any packets; 
-          e.g. 'ping' does not work.
-Reason:   There is an incorrect route in your routing table.
-Solution: Check the routing table with the command 'route' and read the 
-          manual help pages dealing with routes (enter 'man route').
-
-NOTE: Although the 2.2.x kernel versions generate the routing entry 
-      automatically, problems of this kind may occur here as well. We've 
-      come across a situation in which the driver started correctly at 
-      system start, but after the driver has been removed and reloaded,
-      the route of the adapter's network pointed to the 'dummy0'device 
-      and had to be corrected manually.
-
-
-Problem:  Your computer should act as a router between multiple 
-          IP subnetworks (using multiple adapters), but computers in 
-          other subnetworks cannot be reached.
-Reason:   Either the router's kernel is not configured for IP forwarding 
-          or the routing table and gateway configuration of at least one 
-          computer is not working.
-
-Problem:  Upon driver start, the following error message is displayed:
