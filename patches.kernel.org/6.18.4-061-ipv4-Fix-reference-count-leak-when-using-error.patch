Subject: [PATCH] ipv4: Fix reference count leak when using error routes with
 nexthop objects
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.4
Git-commit: ac782f4e3bfcde145b8a7f8af31d9422d94d172a

[ Upstream commit ac782f4e3bfcde145b8a7f8af31d9422d94d172a ]

When a nexthop object is deleted, it is marked as dead and then
fib_table_flush() is called to flush all the routes that are using the
dead nexthop.

The current logic in fib_table_flush() is to only flush error routes
(e.g., blackhole) when it is called as part of network namespace
dismantle (i.e., with flush_all=true). Therefore, error routes are not
flushed when their nexthop object is deleted:

 # ip link add name dummy1 up type dummy
 # ip nexthop add id 1 dev dummy1
 # ip route add 198.51.100.1/32 nhid 1
 # ip route add blackhole 198.51.100.2/32 nhid 1
 # ip nexthop del id 1
 # ip route show
 blackhole 198.51.100.2 nhid 1 dev dummy1

As such, they keep holding a reference on the nexthop object which in
turn holds a reference on the nexthop device, resulting in a reference
count leak:

 # ip link del dev dummy1
 [   70.516258] unregister_netdevice: waiting for dummy1 to become free. Usage count = 2

Fix by flushing error routes when their nexthop is marked as dead.

IPv6 does not suffer from this problem.
