Subject: [PATCH] net: dsa: fix off-by-one in maximum bridge ID determination
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.8
Git-commit: dfca045cd4d0ea07ff4198ba392be3e718acaddc

[ Upstream commit dfca045cd4d0ea07ff4198ba392be3e718acaddc ]

Prior to the blamed commit, the bridge_num range was from
0 to ds->max_num_bridges - 1. After the commit, it is from
1 to ds->max_num_bridges.

So this check:
	if (bridge_num >= max)
		return 0;
must be updated to:
	if (bridge_num > max)
		return 0;

in order to allow the last bridge_num value (==max) to be used.

This is easiest visible when a driver sets ds->max_num_bridges=1.
The observed behaviour is that even the first created bridge triggers
the netlink extack "Range of offloadable bridges exceeded" warning, and
is handled in software rather than being offloaded.
