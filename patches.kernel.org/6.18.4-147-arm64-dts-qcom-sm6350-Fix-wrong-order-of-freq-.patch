Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sm6350: Fix wrong order of freq-table-hz
 for UFS
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.4
Git-commit: ec9d588391761a08aab5eb4523a48ef3df2c910f

commit ec9d588391761a08aab5eb4523a48ef3df2c910f upstream.

During upstreaming the order of clocks was adjusted to match the
upstream sort order, but mistakently freq-table-hz wasn't re-ordered
with the new order.

Fix that by moving the entry for the ICE clk to the last place.
