Subject: [PATCH] ring-buffer: Make wake once of ring_buffer_wait() more robust
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.3
Git-commit: b70f2938242a028f8e9473781ede175486a59dc8

[ Upstream commit b70f2938242a028f8e9473781ede175486a59dc8 ]

The default behavior of ring_buffer_wait() when passed a NULL "cond"
parameter is to exit the function the first time it is woken up. The
current implementation uses a counter that starts at zero and when it is
greater than one it exits the wait_event_interruptible().

But this relies on the internal working of wait_event_interruptible() as
that code basically has:

  if (cond)
    return;
  prepare_to_wait();
  if (!cond)
    schedule();
  finish_wait();

That is, cond is called twice before it sleeps. The default cond of
ring_buffer_wait() needs to account for that and wait for its counter to
increment twice before exiting.

Instead, use the seq/atomic_inc logic that is used by the tracing code
that calls this function. Add an atomic_t seq to rb_irq_work and when cond
is NULL, have the default callback take a descriptor as its data that
holds the rbwork and the value of the seq when it started.

The wakeups will now increment the rbwork->seq and the cond callback will
simply check if that number is different, and no longer have to rely on
the implementation of wait_event_interruptible().
