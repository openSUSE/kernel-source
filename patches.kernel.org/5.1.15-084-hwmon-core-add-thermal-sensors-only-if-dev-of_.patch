Subject: [PATCH] hwmon: (core) add thermal sensors only if dev->of_node is
 present
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.15
Git-commit: c41dd48e21fae3e55b3670ccf2eb562fc1f6a67d

[ Upstream commit c41dd48e21fae3e55b3670ccf2eb562fc1f6a67d ]

Drivers may register to hwmon and request for also registering
with the thermal subsystem (HWMON_C_REGISTER_TZ). However,
some of these driver, e.g. marvell phy, may be probed from
Device Tree or being dynamically allocated, and in the later
case, it will not have a dev->of_node entry.

Registering with hwmon without the dev->of_node may result in
different outcomes depending on the device tree, which may
be a bit misleading. If the device tree blob has no 'thermal-zones'
node, the *hwmon_device_register*() family functions are going
to gracefully succeed, because of-thermal,
*thermal_zone_of_sensor_register() return -ENODEV in this case,
and the hwmon error path handles this error code as success to
cover for the case where CONFIG_THERMAL_OF is not set.
However, if the device tree blob has the 'thermal-zones'
entry, the *hwmon_device_register*() will always fail on callers
with no dev->of_node, propagating -EINVAL.

If dev->of_node is not present, calling of-thermal does not
make sense. For this reason, this patch checks first if the
device has a of_node before going over the process of registering
with the thermal subsystem of-thermal interface. And in this case,
when a caller of *hwmon_device_register*() with HWMON_C_REGISTER_TZ
and no dev->of_node will still register with hwmon, but not with
the thermal subsystem. If all the hwmon part bits are in place,
the registration will succeed.
