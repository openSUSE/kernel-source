Subject: [PATCH] Fix aio_poll() races
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.11
Git-commit: af5c72b1fc7a00aa484e90b0c4e0eeb582545634

commit af5c72b1fc7a00aa484e90b0c4e0eeb582545634 upstream.

aio_poll() has to cope with several unpleasant problems:
	* requests that might stay around indefinitely need to
be made visible for io_cancel(2); that must not be done to
a request already completed, though.
	* in cases when ->poll() has placed us on a waitqueue,
wakeup might have happened (and request completed) before ->poll()
returns.
	* worse, in some early wakeup cases request might end
up re-added into the queue later - we can't treat "woken up and
currently not in the queue" as "it's not going to stick around
indefinitely"
	* ... moreover, ->poll() might have decided not to
put it on any queues to start with, and that needs to be distinguished
from the previous case
	* ->poll() might have tried to put us on more than one queue.
Only the first will succeed for aio poll, so we might end up missing
wakeups.  OTOH, we might very well notice that only after the
wakeup hits and request gets completed (all before ->poll() gets
around to the second poll_wait()).  In that case it's too late to
decide that we have an error.

req->woken was an attempt to deal with that.  Unfortunately, it was
broken.  What we need to keep track of is not that wakeup has happened -
the thing might come back after that.  It's that async reference is
already gone and won't come back, so we can't (and needn't) put the
request on the list of cancellables.

The easiest case is "request hadn't been put on any waitqueues"; we
can tell by seeing NULL apt.head, and in that case there won't be
anything async.  We should either complete the request ourselves
(if vfs_poll() reports anything of interest) or return an error.

In all other cases we get exclusion with wakeups by grabbing the
queue lock.

If request is currently on queue and we have something interesting
from vfs_poll(), we can steal it and complete the request ourselves.

If it's on queue and vfs_poll() has not reported anything interesting,
we either put it on the cancellable list, or, if we know that it
hadn't been put on all queues ->poll() wanted it on, we steal it and
return an error.

If it's _not_ on queue, it's either been already dealt with (in which
case we do nothing), or there's aio_poll_complete_work() about to be
executed.  In that case we either put it on the cancellable list,
or, if we know it hadn't been put on all queues ->poll() wanted it on,
simulate what cancel would've done.

It's a lot more convoluted than I'd like it to be.  Single-consumer APIs
suck, and unfortunately aio is not an exception...
