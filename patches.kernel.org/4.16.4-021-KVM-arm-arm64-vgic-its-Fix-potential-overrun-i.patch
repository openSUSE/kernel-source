Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-its: Fix potential overrun in
 vgic_copy_lpi_list
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.4
Git-commit: 7d8b44c54e0c7c8f688e3a07f17e6083f849f01f

commit 7d8b44c54e0c7c8f688e3a07f17e6083f849f01f upstream.

vgic_copy_lpi_list() parses the LPI list and picks LPIs targeting
a given vcpu. We allocate the array containing the intids before taking
the lpi_list_lock, which means we can have an array size that is not
equal to the number of LPIs.

This is particularly obvious when looking at the path coming from
vgic_enable_lpis, which is not a command, and thus can run in parallel
with commands:

vcpu 0:                                        vcpu 1:
vgic_enable_lpis
  its_sync_lpi_pending_table
    vgic_copy_lpi_list
      intids = kmalloc_array(irq_count)
                                               MAPI(lpi targeting vcpu 0)
      list_for_each_entry(lpi_list_head)
        intids[i++] = irq->intid;

At that stage, we will happily overrun the intids array. Boo. An easy
fix is is to break once the array is full. The MAPI command will update
the config anyway, and we won't miss a thing. We also make sure that
lpi_list_count is read exactly once, so that further updates of that
value will not affect the array bound check.
