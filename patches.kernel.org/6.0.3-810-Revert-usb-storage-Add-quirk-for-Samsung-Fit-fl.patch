Subject: [PATCH] Revert "usb: storage: Add quirk for Samsung Fit flash"
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.3
Git-commit: ad5dbfc123e6ffbbde194e2a4603323e09f741ee

[ Upstream commit ad5dbfc123e6ffbbde194e2a4603323e09f741ee ]

This reverts commit 86d92f5465958752481269348d474414dccb1552,
which fix the timeout issue for "Samsung Fit Flash".

But the commit affects not only "Samsung Fit Flash" but also other usb
storages that use the same controller and causes severe performance
regression.

 # hdparm -t /dev/sda (without the quirk)
 Timing buffered disk reads: 622 MB in  3.01 seconds = 206.66 MB/sec

 # hdparm -t /dev/sda (with the quirk)
 Timing buffered disk reads: 220 MB in  3.00 seconds =  73.32 MB/sec

The commit author mentioned that "Issue was reproduced after device has
bad block", so this quirk should be applied when we have the timeout
issue with a device that has bad blocks.

We revert the commit so that we apply this quirk by adding kernel
paramters using a bootloader or other ways when we really need it,
without the performance regression with devices that don't have the
issue.
