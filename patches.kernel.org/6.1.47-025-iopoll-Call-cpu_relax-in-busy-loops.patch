Subject: [PATCH] iopoll: Call cpu_relax() in busy loops
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.47

[ Upstream commit b407460ee99033503993ac7437d593451fcdfe44 ]

It is considered good practice to call cpu_relax() in busy loops, see
Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst.  This can not
only lower CPU power consumption or yield to a hyperthreaded twin
processor, but also allows an architecture to mitigate hardware issues
(e.g. ARM Erratum 754327 for Cortex-A9 prior to r2p0) in the
architecture-specific cpu_relax() implementation.

In addition, cpu_relax() is also a compiler barrier.  It is not
immediately obvious that the @op argument "function" will result in an
actual function call (e.g. in case of inlining).

Where a function call is a C sequence point, this is lost on inlining.
Therefore, with agressive enough optimization it might be possible for
the compiler to hoist the:

        (val) = op(args);

"load" out of the loop because it doesn't see the value changing. The
addition of cpu_relax() would inhibit this.

As the iopoll helpers lack calls to cpu_relax(), people are sometimes
reluctant to use them, and may fall back to open-coded polling loops
(including cpu_relax() calls) instead.

Fix this by adding calls to cpu_relax() to the iopoll helpers:
  - For the non-atomic case, it is sufficient to call cpu_relax() in
    case of a zero sleep-between-reads value, as a call to
    usleep_range() is a safe barrier otherwise.  However, it doesn't
    hurt to add the call regardless, for simplicity, and for similarity
    with the atomic case below.
  - For the atomic case, cpu_relax() must be called regardless of the
    sleep-between-reads value, as there is no guarantee all
    architecture-specific implementations of udelay() handle this.
