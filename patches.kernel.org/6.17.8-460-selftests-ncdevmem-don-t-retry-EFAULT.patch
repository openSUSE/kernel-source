Subject: [PATCH] selftests: ncdevmem: don't retry EFAULT
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.8
Git-commit: 8c0b9ed2401b9b3f164c8c94221899a1ace6e9ab

[ Upstream commit 8c0b9ed2401b9b3f164c8c94221899a1ace6e9ab ]

devmem test fails on NIPA. Most likely we get skb(s) with readable
frags (why?) but the failure manifests as an OOM. The OOM happens
because ncdevmem spams the following message:

  recvmsg ret=-1
  recvmsg: Bad address

As of today, ncdevmem can't deal with various reasons of EFAULT:
- falling back to regular recvmsg for non-devmem skbs
- increasing ctrl_data size (can't happen with ncdevmem's large buffer)

Exit (cleanly) with error when recvmsg returns EFAULT. This should at
least cause the test to cleanup its state.
