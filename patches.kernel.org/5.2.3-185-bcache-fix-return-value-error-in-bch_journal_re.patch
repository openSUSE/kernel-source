Subject: [PATCH] bcache: fix return value error in bch_journal_read()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.3
Git-commit: 0ae49cb7aa005ed18fe8f4d6ccf73019b78ac7b2

[ Upstream commit 0ae49cb7aa005ed18fe8f4d6ccf73019b78ac7b2 ]

When everything is OK in bch_journal_read(), finally the return value
is returned by,
	return ret;
which assumes ret will be 0 here. This assumption is wrong when all
journal buckets as are full and filled with valid journal entries. In
such cache the last location referencess read_bucket() sets 'ret' to
1, which means new jset added into jset list. The jset list is list
'journal' in caller run_cache_set().

Return 1 to run_cache_set() means something wrong and the cache set
won't start, but indeed everything is OK.

This patch changes the line at end of bch_journal_read() to directly
return 0 since everything if verything is good. Then a bogus error
is fixed.
