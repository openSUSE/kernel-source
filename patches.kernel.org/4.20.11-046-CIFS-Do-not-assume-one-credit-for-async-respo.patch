Subject: [PATCH] CIFS: Do not assume one credit for async responses
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.11
Git-commit: 0fd1d37b0501efc6e295f56ab55cdaff784aa50c

[ Upstream commit 0fd1d37b0501efc6e295f56ab55cdaff784aa50c ]

If we don't receive a response we can't assume that the server
granted one credit. Assume zero credits in such cases.
