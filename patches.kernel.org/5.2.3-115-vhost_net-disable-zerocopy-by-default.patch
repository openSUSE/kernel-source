Subject: [PATCH] vhost_net: disable zerocopy by default
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.3
Git-commit: 098eadce3c622c07b328d0a43dda379b38cf7c5e

[ Upstream commit 098eadce3c622c07b328d0a43dda379b38cf7c5e ]

Vhost_net was known to suffer from HOL[1] issues which is not easy to
fix. Several downstream disable the feature by default. What's more,
the datapath was split and datacopy path got the support of batching
and XDP support recently which makes it faster than zerocopy part for
small packets transmission.

It looks to me that disable zerocopy by default is more
appropriate. It cold be enabled by default again in the future if we
fix the above issues.
