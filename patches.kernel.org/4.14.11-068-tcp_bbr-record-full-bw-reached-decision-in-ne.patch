Subject: [PATCH] tcp_bbr: record "full bw reached" decision in new
 full_bw_reached bit
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.11
Git-commit: c589e69b508d29ed8e644dfecda453f71c02ec27

[ Upstream commit c589e69b508d29ed8e644dfecda453f71c02ec27 ]

This commit records the "full bw reached" decision in a new
full_bw_reached bit. This is a pure refactor that does not change the
current behavior, but enables subsequent fixes and improvements.

In particular, this enables simple and clean fixes because the full_bw
and full_bw_cnt can be unconditionally zeroed without worrying about
forgetting that we estimated we filled the pipe in Startup. And it
enables future improvements because multiple code paths can be used
for estimating that we filled the pipe in Startup; any new code paths
only need to set this bit when they think the pipe is full.

Note that this fix intentionally reduces the width of the full_bw_cnt
counter, since we have never used the most significant bit.
