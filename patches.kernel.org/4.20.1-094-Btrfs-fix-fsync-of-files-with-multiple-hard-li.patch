Subject: [PATCH] Btrfs: fix fsync of files with multiple hard links in new
 directories
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.1
Git-commit: 41bd60676923822de1df2c50b3f9a10171f4338a

commit 41bd60676923822de1df2c50b3f9a10171f4338a upstream.

The log tree has a long standing problem that when a file is fsync'ed we
only check for new ancestors, created in the current transaction, by
following only the hard link for which the fsync was issued. We follow the
ancestors using the VFS' dget_parent() API. This means that if we create a
new link for a file in a directory that is new (or in an any other new
ancestor directory) and then fsync the file using an old hard link, we end
up not logging the new ancestor, and on log replay that new hard link and
ancestor do not exist. In some cases, involving renames, the file will not
exist at all.

Example:

  mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdb
  mount /dev/sdb /mnt

  mkdir /mnt/A
  touch /mnt/foo
  ln /mnt/foo /mnt/A/bar
  xfs_io -c fsync /mnt/foo

  <power failure>

In this example after log replay only the hard link named 'foo' exists
and directory A does not exist, which is unexpected. In other major linux
filesystems, such as ext4, xfs and f2fs for example, both hard links exist
and so does directory A after mounting again the filesystem.

Checking if any new ancestors are new and need to be logged was added in
2009 by commit 12fcfd22fe5b ("Btrfs: tree logging unlink/rename fixes"),
however only for the ancestors of the hard link (dentry) for which the
fsync was issued, instead of checking for all ancestors for all of the
inode's hard links.

So fix this by tracking the id of the last transaction where a hard link
was created for an inode and then on fsync fallback to a full transaction
commit when an inode has more than one hard link and at least one new hard
link was created in the current transaction. This is the simplest solution
since this is not a common use case (adding frequently hard links for
which there's an ancestor created in the current transaction and then
fsync the file). In case it ever becomes a common use case, a solution
that consists of iterating the fs/subvol btree for each hard link and
check if any ancestor is new, could be implemented.

This solves many unexpected scenarios reported by Jayashree Mohan and
Vijay Chidambaram, and for which there is a new test case for fstests
under review.
