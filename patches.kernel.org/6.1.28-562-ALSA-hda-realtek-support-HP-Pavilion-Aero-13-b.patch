Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/realtek: support HP Pavilion Aero 13-be0xxx Mute
 LED
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.28
Git-commit: e7477cb97607b373d175a759c8c0270a640ab3f2

commit e7477cb97607b373d175a759c8c0270a640ab3f2 upstream.

This patch adds support for the mute LED on the HP Pavilion Aero Laptop
13-be0xxx. The current behavior is that the LED does not turn on at any
time and does not indicate to the user whether the sound is muted.

The solution is to add a PCI quirk to properly recognize and support the
LED on this device.

This change has been tested on the device in question using modified
versions of kernels 6.0.7-6.2.12 on Arch Linux.
