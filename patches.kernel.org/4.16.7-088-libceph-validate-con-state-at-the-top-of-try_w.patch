Subject: [PATCH] libceph: validate con->state at the top of try_write()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.7
Git-commit: 9c55ad1c214d9f8c4594ac2c3fa392c1c32431a7

commit 9c55ad1c214d9f8c4594ac2c3fa392c1c32431a7 upstream.

ceph_con_workfn() validates con->state before calling try_read() and
then try_write().  However, try_read() temporarily releases con->mutex,
notably in process_message() and ceph_con_in_msg_alloc(), opening the
window for ceph_con_close() to sneak in, close the connection and
release con->sock.  When try_write() is called on the assumption that
con->state is still valid (i.e. not STANDBY or CLOSED), a NULL sock
gets passed to the networking stack:

  BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000020
  IP: selinux_socket_sendmsg+0x5/0x20

Make sure con->state is valid at the top of try_write() and add an
explicit BUG_ON for this, similar to try_read().
