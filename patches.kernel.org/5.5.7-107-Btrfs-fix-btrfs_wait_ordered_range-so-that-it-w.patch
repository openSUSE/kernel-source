Subject: [PATCH] Btrfs: fix btrfs_wait_ordered_range() so that it waits for
 all ordered extents
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.7
Git-commit: e75fd33b3f744f644061a4f9662bd63f5434f806

commit e75fd33b3f744f644061a4f9662bd63f5434f806 upstream.

In btrfs_wait_ordered_range() once we find an ordered extent that has
finished with an error we exit the loop and don't wait for any other
ordered extents that might be still in progress.

All the users of btrfs_wait_ordered_range() expect that there are no more
ordered extents in progress after that function returns. So past fixes
such like the ones from the two following commits:

  ff612ba7849964 ("btrfs: fix panic during relocation after ENOSPC before
                   writeback happens")

  28aeeac1dd3080 ("Btrfs: fix panic when starting bg cache writeout after
                   IO error")

don't work when there are multiple ordered extents in the range.

Fix that by making btrfs_wait_ordered_range() wait for all ordered extents
even after it finds one that had an error.
