Subject: [PATCH] x86/mce: Fix incorrect "Machine check from unknown source"
 message
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.4
Git-commit: 40c36e2741d7fe1e66d6ec55477ba5fd19c9c5d2

commit 40c36e2741d7fe1e66d6ec55477ba5fd19c9c5d2 upstream.

Some injection testing resulted in the following console log:

  mce: [Hardware Error]: CPU 22: Machine Check Exception: f Bank 1: bd80000000100134
  mce: [Hardware Error]: RIP 10:<ffffffffc05292dd> {pmem_do_bvec+0x11d/0x330 [nd_pmem]}
  mce: [Hardware Error]: TSC c51a63035d52 ADDR 3234bc4000 MISC 88
  mce: [Hardware Error]: PROCESSOR 0:50654 TIME 1526502199 SOCKET 0 APIC 38 microcode 2000043
  mce: [Hardware Error]: Run the above through 'mcelog --ascii'
  Kernel panic - not syncing: Machine check from unknown source

This confused everybody because the first line quite clearly shows
that we found a logged error in "Bank 1", while the last line says
"unknown source".

The problem is that the Linux code doesn't do the right thing
for a local machine check that results in a fatal error.

It turns out that we know very early in the handler whether the
machine check is fatal. The call to mce_no_way_out() has checked
all the banks for the CPU that took the local machine check. If
it says we must crash, we can do so right away with the right
messages.

We do scan all the banks again. This means that we might initially
not see a problem, but during the second scan find something fatal.
If this happens we print a slightly different message (so I can
see if it actually every happens).

[ bp: Remove unneeded severity assignment. ]
