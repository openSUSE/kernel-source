Subject: [PATCH] KVM: VMX: Mark VMXArea with revision_id of physical CPU even
 when eVMCS enabled
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.10
Git-commit: 2307af1c4b2e0ad886f30e31739845322cbd328b

commit 2307af1c4b2e0ad886f30e31739845322cbd328b upstream.

When eVMCS is enabled, all VMCS allocated to be used by KVM are marked
with revision_id of KVM_EVMCS_VERSION instead of revision_id reported
by MSR_IA32_VMX_BASIC.

However, even though not explictly documented by TLFS, VMXArea passed
as VMXON argument should still be marked with revision_id reported by
physical CPU.

This issue was found by the following setup:
* L0 = KVM which expose eVMCS to it's L1 guest.
* L1 = KVM which consume eVMCS reported by L0.
This setup caused the following to occur:
1) L1 execute hardware_enable().
2) hardware_enable() calls kvm_cpu_vmxon() to execute VMXON.
3) L0 intercept L1 VMXON and execute handle_vmon() which notes
vmxarea->revision_id != VMCS12_REVISION and therefore fails with
nested_vmx_failInvalid() which sets RFLAGS.CF.
4) L1 kvm_cpu_vmxon() don't check RFLAGS.CF for failure and therefore
hardware_enable() continues as usual.
5) L1 hardware_enable() then calls ept_sync_global() which executes
INVEPT.
6) L0 intercept INVEPT and execute handle_invept() which notes
!vmx->nested.vmxon and thus raise a #UD to L1.
7) Raised #UD caused L1 to panic.
