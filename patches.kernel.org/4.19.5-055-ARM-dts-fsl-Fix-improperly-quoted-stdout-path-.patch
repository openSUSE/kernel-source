Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: fsl: Fix improperly quoted stdout-path values
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.5
Git-commit: 1af6ab3bac8458fc2e92ad7bb97b62de4a1fddef

[ Upstream commit 1af6ab3bac8458fc2e92ad7bb97b62de4a1fddef ]

A quoted label reference doesn't expand to the node path and is taken as
a literal string. Dropping the quotes can fix this unless the baudrate
string is appended in which case we have to use the alias.

At least on VF610, the problem was masked by setting the console in
bootargs. Use the alias syntax with baudrate parameter so we can drop
setting the console in bootargs.
