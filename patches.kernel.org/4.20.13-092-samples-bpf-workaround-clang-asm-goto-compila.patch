Subject: [PATCH] samples/bpf: workaround clang asm goto compilation errors
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.13
Git-commit: 6bf3bbe1f4d4cf405e3c2bf07bbdff56d3223ec8

[ Upstream commit 6bf3bbe1f4d4cf405e3c2bf07bbdff56d3223ec8 ]

x86 compilation has required asm goto support since 4.17.
Since clang does not support asm goto, at 4.17,
Commit b1ae32dbab50 ("x86/cpufeature: Guard asm_volatile_goto usage
for BPF compilation") worked around the issue by permitting an
alternative implementation without asm goto for clang.

At 5.0, more asm goto usages appeared.
  [yhs@148 x86]$ egrep -r asm_volatile_goto
  include/asm/cpufeature.h:     asm_volatile_goto("1: jmp 6f\n"
  include/asm/jump_label.h:     asm_volatile_goto("1:"
  include/asm/jump_label.h:     asm_volatile_goto("1:"
  include/asm/rmwcc.h:  asm_volatile_goto (fullop "; j" #cc " %l[cc_label]"     \
  include/asm/uaccess.h:        asm_volatile_goto("\n"                          \
  include/asm/uaccess.h:        asm_volatile_goto("\n"                          \
  [yhs@148 x86]$

Compiling samples/bpf directories, most bpf programs failed
compilation with error messages like:

  #define asm_volatile_goto(x...) asm goto(x)

Most implementation does not even provide an alternative
implementation. And it is also not practical to make changes
for each call site.

This patch workarounded the asm goto issue by redefining the macro like below:
  #define asm_volatile_goto(x...) asm volatile("invalid use of asm_volatile_goto")

If asm_volatile_goto is not used by bpf programs, which is typically the case, nothing bad
will happen. If asm_volatile_goto is used by bpf programs, which is incorrect, the compiler
will issue an error since "invalid use of asm_volatile_goto" is not valid assembly codes.

With this patch, all bpf programs under samples/bpf can pass compilation.

Note that bpf programs under tools/testing/selftests/bpf/ compiled fine as
they do not access kernel internal headers.

Fixes: 18fe58229d80 ("x86, asm: change the GEN_*_RMWcc() macros to not quote the condition")
