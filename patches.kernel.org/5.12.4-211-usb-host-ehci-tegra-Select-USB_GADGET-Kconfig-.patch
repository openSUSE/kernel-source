Subject: [PATCH] usb: host: ehci-tegra: Select USB_GADGET Kconfig option
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.4
Git-commit: 0b9828763aeafa5e527b9d98b8789bdb34937fbc

[ Upstream commit 0b9828763aeafa5e527b9d98b8789bdb34937fbc ]

Select USB_GADGET Kconfig option in order to fix build failure which
happens because ChipIdea driver has a build dependency on both USB_GADGET
and USB_EHCI_HCD, while USB_EHCI_TEGRA force-selects the ChipIdea driver
without taking into account the tristate USB_GADGET dependency. It's not
possible to do anything about the cyclic dependency of the Kconfig
options, but USB_EHCI_TEGRA is now a deprecated option that isn't used
by defconfigs and USB_GADGET is wanted on Tegra by default, hence it's
okay to have a bit clunky workaround for it.
