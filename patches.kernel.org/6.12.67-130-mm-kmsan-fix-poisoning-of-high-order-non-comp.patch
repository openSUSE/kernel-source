Subject: [PATCH] mm: kmsan: fix poisoning of high-order non-compound pages
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.67
Git-commit: 4795d205d78690a46b60164f44b8bb7b3e800865

[ Upstream commit 4795d205d78690a46b60164f44b8bb7b3e800865 ]

kmsan_free_page() is called by the page allocator's free_pages_prepare()
during page freeing.  Its job is to poison all the memory covered by the
page.  It can be called with an order-0 page, a compound high-order page
or a non-compound high-order page.  But page_size() only works for order-0
and compound pages.  For a non-compound high-order page it will
incorrectly return PAGE_SIZE.

The implication is that the tail pages of a high-order non-compound page
do not get poisoned at free, so any invalid access while they are free
could go unnoticed.  It looks like the pages will be poisoned again at
allocation time, so that would bookend the window.

Fix this by using the order parameter to calculate the size.
