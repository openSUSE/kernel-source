Subject: [PATCH] sched: Fix unreliable rseq cpu_id for new tasks
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.10
Git-commit: ce3614daabea8a2d01c1dd17ae41d1ec5e5ae7db

commit ce3614daabea8a2d01c1dd17ae41d1ec5e5ae7db upstream.

While integrating rseq into glibc and replacing glibc's sched_getcpu
implementation with rseq, glibc's tests discovered an issue with
incorrect __rseq_abi.cpu_id field value right after the first time
a newly created process issues sched_setaffinity.

For the records, it triggers after building glibc and running tests, and
then issuing:

  for x in {1..2000} ; do posix/tst-affinity-static  & done

and shows up as:

error: Unexpected CPU 2, expected 0
error: Unexpected CPU 2, expected 0
error: Unexpected CPU 2, expected 0
error: Unexpected CPU 2, expected 0
error: Unexpected CPU 138, expected 0
error: Unexpected CPU 138, expected 0
error: Unexpected CPU 138, expected 0
error: Unexpected CPU 138, expected 0

This is caused by the scheduler invoking __set_task_cpu() directly from
sched_fork() and wake_up_new_task(), thus bypassing rseq_migrate() which
is done by set_task_cpu().

Add the missing rseq_migrate() to both functions. The only other direct
use of __set_task_cpu() is done by init_idle(), which does not involve a
user-space task.

Based on my testing with the glibc test-case, just adding rseq_migrate()
to wake_up_new_task() is sufficient to fix the observed issue. Also add
it to sched_fork() to keep things consistent.

The reason why this never triggered so far with the rseq/basic_test
selftest is unclear.

The current use of sched_getcpu(3) does not typically require it to be
always accurate. However, use of the __rseq_abi.cpu_id field within rseq
critical sections requires it to be accurate. If it is not accurate, it
can cause corruption in the per-cpu data targeted by rseq critical
sections in user-space.
