Subject: [PATCH] tracing: Add barrier to trace_printk() buffer nesting
 modification
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.13.4
Git-commit: 3d9622c12c8873911f4cc0ccdabd0362c2fca06b

commit 3d9622c12c8873911f4cc0ccdabd0362c2fca06b upstream.

trace_printk() uses 4 buffers, one for each context (normal, softirq, irq
and NMI), such that it does not need to worry about one context preempting
the other. There's a nesting counter that gets incremented to figure out
which buffer to use. If the context gets preempted by another context which
calls trace_printk() it will increment the counter and use the next buffer,
and restore the counter when it is finished.

The problem is that gcc may optimize the modification of the buffer nesting
counter and it may not be incremented in memory before the buffer is used.
If this happens, and the context gets interrupted by another context, it
could pick the same buffer and corrupt the one that is being used.

Compiler barriers need to be added after the nesting variable is incremented
and before it is decremented to prevent usage of the context buffers by more
than one context at the same time.
