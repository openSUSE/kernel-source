Subject: [PATCH] sched/uclamp: Fix wrong implementation of cpu.uclamp.min
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.2
Git-commit: 0c18f2ecfcc274a4bcc1d122f79ebd4001c3b445

[ Upstream commit 0c18f2ecfcc274a4bcc1d122f79ebd4001c3b445 ]

cpu.uclamp.min is a protection as described in cgroup-v2 Resource
Distribution Model

	Documentation/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.rst

which means we try our best to preserve the minimum performance point of
tasks in this group. See full description of cpu.uclamp.min in the
cgroup-v2.rst.

But the current implementation makes it a limit, which is not what was
intended.

For example:

	tg->cpu.uclamp.min = 20%

	p0->uclamp[UCLAMP_MIN] = 0
	p1->uclamp[UCLAMP_MIN] = 50%

	Previous Behavior (limit):

		p0->effective_uclamp = 0
		p1->effective_uclamp = 20%

	New Behavior (Protection):

		p0->effective_uclamp = 20%
		p1->effective_uclamp = 50%

Which is inline with how protections should work.

With this change the cgroup and per-task behaviors are the same, as
expected.

Additionally, we remove the confusing relationship between cgroup and
!user_defined flag.

We don't want for example RT tasks that are boosted by default to max to
change their boost value when they attach to a cgroup. If a cgroup wants
to limit the max performance point of tasks attached to it, then
cpu.uclamp.max must be set accordingly.

Or if they want to set different boost value based on cgroup, then
sysctl_sched_util_clamp_min_rt_default must be used to NOT boost to max
and set the right cpu.uclamp.min for each group to let the RT tasks
obtain the desired boost value when attached to that group.

As it stands the dependency on !user_defined flag adds an extra layer of
complexity that is not required now cpu.uclamp.min behaves properly as
a protection.

The propagation model of effective cpu.uclamp.min in child cgroups as
implemented by cpu_util_update_eff() is still correct. The parent
protection sets an upper limit of what the child cgroups will
effectively get.
