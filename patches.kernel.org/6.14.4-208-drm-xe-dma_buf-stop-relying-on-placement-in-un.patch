commit 25583ad42d091819157832e894179200ba8b54ee upstream.

The is_vram() is checking the current placement, however if we consider
exported VRAM with dynamic dma-buf, it looks possible for the xe driver
to async evict the memory, notifying the importer, however importer does
not have to call unmap_attachment() immediately, but rather just as
"soon as possible", like when the dma-resv idles. Following from this we
would then pipeline the move, attaching the fence to the manager, and
then update the current placement. But when the unmap_attachment() runs
at some later point we might see that is_vram() is now false, and take
the complete wrong path when dma-unmapping the sg, leading to
explosions.

To fix this check if the sgl was mapping a struct page.

v2:
  - The attachment can be mapped multiple times it seems, so we can't
    really rely on encoding something in the attachment->priv. Instead
    see if the page_link has an encoded struct page. For vram we expect
    this to be NULL.
