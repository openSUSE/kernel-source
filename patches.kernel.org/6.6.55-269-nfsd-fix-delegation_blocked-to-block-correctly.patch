Subject: [PATCH] nfsd: fix delegation_blocked() to block correctly for at
 least 30 seconds
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.55
Git-commit: 45bb63ed20e02ae146336412889fe5450316a84f

commit 45bb63ed20e02ae146336412889fe5450316a84f upstream.

The pair of bloom filtered used by delegation_blocked() was intended to
block delegations on given filehandles for between 30 and 60 seconds.  A
new filehandle would be recorded in the "new" bit set.  That would then
be switch to the "old" bit set between 0 and 30 seconds later, and it
would remain as the "old" bit set for 30 seconds.

Unfortunately the code intended to clear the old bit set once it reached
30 seconds old, preparing it to be the next new bit set, instead cleared
the *new* bit set before switching it to be the old bit set.  This means
that the "old" bit set is always empty and delegations are blocked
between 0 and 30 seconds.

This patch updates bd->new before clearing the set with that index,
instead of afterwards.
