Subject: [PATCH] usbnet: ipheth: document scope of NCM implementation
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.3
Git-commit: be154b598fa54136e2be17d6dd13c8a8bc0078ce

commit be154b598fa54136e2be17d6dd13c8a8bc0078ce upstream.

Clarify that the "NCM" implementation in `ipheth` is very limited, as
iOS devices aren't compatible with the CDC NCM specification in regular
tethering mode.

For a standards-compliant implementation, one shall turn to
the `cdc_ncm` module.
