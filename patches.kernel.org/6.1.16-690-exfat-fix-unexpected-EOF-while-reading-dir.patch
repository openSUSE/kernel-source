Subject: [PATCH] exfat: fix unexpected EOF while reading dir
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: 6cb5d1a16a51d080fbc1649a5144cbc5ca7d6f88

commit 6cb5d1a16a51d080fbc1649a5144cbc5ca7d6f88 upstream.

If the position is not aligned with the dentry size, the return
value of readdir() will be NULL and errno is 0, which means the
end of the directory stream is reached.

If the position is aligned with dentry size, but there is no file
or directory at the position, exfat_readdir() will continue to
get dentry from the next dentry. So the dentry gotten by readdir()
may not be at the position.

After this commit, if the position is not aligned with the dentry
size, round the position up to the dentry size and continue to get
the dentry.
