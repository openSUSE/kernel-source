Subject: [PATCH] Documentation/hw-vuln: Document the interaction between IBRS
 and STIBP
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: e02b50ca442e88122e1302d4dbc1b71a4808c13f

commit e02b50ca442e88122e1302d4dbc1b71a4808c13f upstream.

Explain why STIBP is needed with legacy IBRS as currently implemented
(KERNEL_IBRS) and why STIBP is not needed when enhanced IBRS is enabled.
