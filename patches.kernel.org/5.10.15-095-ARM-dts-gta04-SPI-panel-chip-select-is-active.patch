Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts; gta04: SPI panel chip select is active low
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.15
Git-commit: 181739822cf6f8f4e12b173913af2967a28906c0

commit 181739822cf6f8f4e12b173913af2967a28906c0 upstream.

With the arrival of

commit 2fee9583198eb9 ("spi: dt-bindings: clarify CS behavior for spi-cs-high and gpio descriptors")

it was clarified what the proper state for cs-gpios should be, even if the
flag is ignored. The driver code is doing the right thing since

766c6b63aa04 ("spi: fix client driver breakages when using GPIO descriptors")

The chip-select of the td028ttec1 panel is active-low, so we must omit spi-cs-high;
attribute (already removed by separate patch) and should now use GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW for
the client device description to be fully consistent.

Fixes: 766c6b63aa04 ("spi: fix client driver breakages when using GPIO descriptors")
