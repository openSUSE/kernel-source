Subject: [PATCH] KVM: SVM: Process ICR on AVIC IPI delivery failure due to
 invalid target
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: 5aede752a839904059c2b5d68be0dc4501c6c15f

commit 5aede752a839904059c2b5d68be0dc4501c6c15f upstream.

Emulate ICR writes on AVIC IPI failures due to invalid targets using the
same logic as failures due to invalid types.  AVIC acceleration fails if
_any_ of the targets are invalid, and crucially VM-Exits before sending
IPIs to targets that _are_ valid.  In logical mode, the destination is a
bitmap, i.e. a single IPI can target multiple logical IDs.  Doing nothing
causes KVM to drop IPIs if at least one target is valid and at least one
target is invalid.

Fixes: 18f40c53e10f ("svm: Add VMEXIT handlers for AVIC")
