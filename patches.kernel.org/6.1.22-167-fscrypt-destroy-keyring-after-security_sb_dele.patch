Subject: [PATCH] fscrypt: destroy keyring after security_sb_delete()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.22
Git-commit: ccb820dc7d2236b1af0d54ae038a27b5b6d5ae5a

commit ccb820dc7d2236b1af0d54ae038a27b5b6d5ae5a upstream.

fscrypt_destroy_keyring() must be called after all potentially-encrypted
inodes were evicted; otherwise it cannot safely destroy the keyring.
Since inodes that are in-use by the Landlock LSM don't get evicted until
security_sb_delete(), this means that fscrypt_destroy_keyring() must be
called *after* security_sb_delete().

This fixes a WARN_ON followed by a NULL dereference, only possible if
Landlock was being used on encrypted files.

Fixes: d7e7b9af104c ("fscrypt: stop using keyrings subsystem for fscrypt_master_key")
