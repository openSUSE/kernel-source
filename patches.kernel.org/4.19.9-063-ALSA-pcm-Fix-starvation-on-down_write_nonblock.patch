Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: pcm: Fix starvation on down_write_nonblock()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.9
Git-commit: b888a5f713e4d17faaaff24316585a4eb07f35b7

commit b888a5f713e4d17faaaff24316585a4eb07f35b7 upstream.

Commit 67ec1072b053 ("ALSA: pcm: Fix rwsem deadlock for non-atomic PCM
stream") fixes deadlock for non-atomic PCM stream. But, This patch
causes antother stuck.
If writer is RT thread and reader is a normal thread, the reader
thread will be difficult to get scheduled. It may not give chance to
release readlocks and writer gets stuck for a long time if they are
pinned to single cpu.

The deadlock described in the previous commit is because the linux
rwsem queues like a FIFO. So, we might need non-FIFO writelock, not
non-block one.

My suggestion is that the writer gives reader a chance to be scheduled
by using the minimum msleep() instaed of spinning without blocking by
writer. Also, The *_nonblock may be changed to *_nonfifo appropriately
to this concept.
In terms of performance, when trylock is failed, this minimum periodic
msleep will have the same performance as the tick-based
schedule()/wake_up_q().

[ Although this has a fairly high performance penalty, the relevant
  code path became already rare due to the previous commit ("ALSA:
  pcm: Call snd_pcm_unlink() conditionally at closing").  That is, now
  this unconditional msleep appears only when using linked streams,
  and this must be a rare case.  So we accept this as a quick
  workaround until finding a more suitable one -- tiwai ]
