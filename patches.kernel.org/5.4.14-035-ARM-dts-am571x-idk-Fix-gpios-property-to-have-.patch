Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: am571x-idk: Fix gpios property to have the correct
 gpio number
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.14
Git-commit: 0c4eb2a6b3c6b0facd0a3bccda5db22e7b3b6f96

commit 0c4eb2a6b3c6b0facd0a3bccda5db22e7b3b6f96 upstream.

commit d23f3839fe97d8dce03d ("ARM: dts: DRA7: Add pcie1 dt node for
EP mode") while adding the dt node for EP mode for DRA7 platform,
added rc node for am571x-idk and populated gpios property with
"gpio3 23". However the GPIO_PCIE_SWRST line is actually connected
to "gpio5 18". Fix it here. (The patch adding "gpio3 23" was tested
with another am57x board in EP mode which doesn't rely on reset from
host).
