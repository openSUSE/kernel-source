Subject: [PATCH] gfs2: fix glock shrinker ref issues
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.6
Git-commit: 62862485a4c3a52029fc30f4bdde9af04afdafc9

[ Upstream commit 62862485a4c3a52029fc30f4bdde9af04afdafc9 ]

Before this patch, function gfs2_scan_glock_lru would only try to free
glocks that had a reference count of 0. But if the reference count ever
got to 0, the glock should have already been freed.

Shrinker function gfs2_dispose_glock_lru checks whether glocks on the
LRU are demote_ok, and if so, tries to demote them. But that's only
possible if the reference count is at least 1.

This patch changes gfs2_scan_glock_lru so it will try to demote and/or
dispose of glocks that have a reference count of 1 and which are either
demotable, or are already unlocked.
