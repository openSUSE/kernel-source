Subject: [PATCH] kfence: await for allocation using wait_event
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.5
Git-commit: 407f1d8c1b5f3ec66a6a3eb835d3b81c76440f4e

[ Upstream commit 407f1d8c1b5f3ec66a6a3eb835d3b81c76440f4e ]

Patch series "kfence: optimize timer scheduling", v2.

We have observed that mostly-idle systems with KFENCE enabled wake up
otherwise idle CPUs, preventing such to enter a lower power state.
Debugging revealed that KFENCE spends too much active time in
toggle_allocation_gate().

While the first version of KFENCE was using all the right bits to be
scheduling optimal, and thus power efficient, by simply using wait_event()
+ wake_up(), that code was unfortunately removed.

As KFENCE was exposed to various different configs and tests, the
scheduling optimal code slowly disappeared.  First because of hung task
warnings, and finally because of deadlocks when an allocation is made by
timer code with debug objects enabled.  Clearly, the "fixes" were not too
friendly for devices that want to be power efficient.

Therefore, let's try a little harder to fix the hung task and deadlock
problems that we have with wait_event() + wake_up(), while remaining as
scheduling friendly and power efficient as possible.

Crucially, we need to defer the wake_up() to an irq_work, avoiding any
potential for deadlock.

The result with this series is that on the devices where we observed a
power regression, power usage returns back to baseline levels.

This patch (of 3):

On mostly-idle systems, we have observed that toggle_allocation_gate() is
a cause of frequent wake-ups, preventing an otherwise idle CPU to go into
a lower power state.

A late change in KFENCE's development, due to a potential deadlock [1],
required changing the scheduling-friendly wait_event_timeout() and
wake_up() to an open-coded wait-loop using schedule_timeout().  [1]
https://lkml.kernel.org/r/000000000000c0645805b7f982e4@google.com

To avoid unnecessary wake-ups, switch to using wait_event_timeout().

Unfortunately, we still cannot use a version with direct wake_up() in
__kfence_alloc() due to the same potential for deadlock as in [1].
Instead, add a level of indirection via an irq_work that is scheduled if
we determine that the kfence_timer requires a wake_up().
