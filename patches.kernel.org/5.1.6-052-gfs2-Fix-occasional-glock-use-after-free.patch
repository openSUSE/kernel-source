Subject: [PATCH] gfs2: Fix occasional glock use-after-free
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.6
Git-commit: 9287c6452d2b1f24ea8e84bd3cf6f3c6f267f712

[ Upstream commit 9287c6452d2b1f24ea8e84bd3cf6f3c6f267f712 ]

This patch has to do with the life cycle of glocks and buffers.  When
gfs2 metadata or journaled data is queued to be written, a gfs2_bufdata
object is assigned to track the buffer, and that is queued to various
lists, including the glock's gl_ail_list to indicate it's on the active
items list.  Once the page associated with the buffer has been written,
it is removed from the ail list, but its life isn't over until a revoke
has been successfully written.

So after the block is written, its bufdata object is moved from the
glock's gl_ail_list to a file-system-wide list of pending revokes,
sd_log_le_revoke.  At that point the glock still needs to track how many
revokes it contributed to that list (in gl_revokes) so that things like
glock go_sync can ensure all the metadata has been not only written, but
also revoked before the glock is granted to a different node.  This is
to guarantee journal replay doesn't replay the block once the glock has
been granted to another node.

Ross Lagerwall recently discovered a race in which an inode could be
evicted, and its glock freed after its ail list had been synced, but
while it still had unwritten revokes on the sd_log_le_revoke list.  The
evict decremented the glock reference count to zero, which allowed the
glock to be freed.  After the revoke was written, function
revoke_lo_after_commit tried to adjust the glock's gl_revokes counter
and clear its GLF_LFLUSH flag, at which time it referenced the freed
glock.

This patch fixes the problem by incrementing the glock reference count
in gfs2_add_revoke when the glock's first bufdata object is moved from
the glock to the global revokes list. Later, when the glock's last such
bufdata object is freed, the reference count is decremented. This
guarantees that whichever process finishes last (the revoke writing or
the evict) will properly free the glock, and neither will reference the
glock after it has been freed.
