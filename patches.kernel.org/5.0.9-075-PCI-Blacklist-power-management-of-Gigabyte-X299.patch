Subject: [PATCH] PCI: Blacklist power management of Gigabyte X299 DESIGNARE EX
 PCIe ports
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.9
Git-commit: 85b0cae89d5266e6a7abb2e83c6f716326fc494c

[ Upstream commit 85b0cae89d5266e6a7abb2e83c6f716326fc494c ]

Gigabyte X299 DESIGNARE EX motherboard has one PCIe root port that is
connected to an Alpine Ridge Thunderbolt controller.  This port has slot
implemented bit set in the config space but other than that it is not
hotplug capable in the sense we are expecting in Linux (it has
dev->is_hotplug_bridge set to 0):

  00:1c.4 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 200 Series PCH PCI Express Root Port #5
    Bus: primary=00, secondary=05, subordinate=46, sec-latency=0
    Memory behind bridge: 78000000-8fffffff [size=384M]
    Prefetchable memory behind bridge: 00003800f8000000-00003800ffffffff [size=128M]
    ...
    Capabilities: [40] Express (v2) Root Port (Slot+), MSI 00
    ...
      SltCap: AttnBtn- PwrCtrl- MRL- AttnInd- PwrInd- HotPlug- Surprise-
	      Slot #8, PowerLimit 25.000W; Interlock- NoCompl+
      SltCtl: Enable: AttnBtn- PwrFlt- MRL- PresDet- CmdCplt- HPIrq- LinkChg-

      SltSta: Status: AttnBtn- PowerFlt- MRL- CmdCplt- PresDet- Interlock-
	      Changed: MRL- PresDet+ LinkState+

This system is using ACPI based hotplug to notify the OS that it needs to
rescan the PCI bus (ACPI hotplug).

If there is nothing connected in any of the Thunderbolt ports the root port
will not have any runtime PM active children and is thus automatically
runtime suspended pretty soon after boot by PCI PM core.  Now, when a
device is connected the BIOS SMI handler responsible for enumerating newly
added devices is not able to find anything because the port is in D3.

Prevent this from happening by blacklisting PCI power management of this
particular Gigabyte system.
