Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: amlogic: meson-g12: Set FL-adj property value
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.15
Git-commit: 7386a559caa6414e74578172c2bc4e636d6bd0a0

[ Upstream commit 7386a559caa6414e74578172c2bc4e636d6bd0a0 ]

In accordance with the DWC USB3 bindings the property is supposed to have
uint32 type. It's erroneous from the DT schema and driver points of view
to declare it as boolean. As Neil suggested set it to 0x20 so not break
the platform and to make the dtbs checker happy.
