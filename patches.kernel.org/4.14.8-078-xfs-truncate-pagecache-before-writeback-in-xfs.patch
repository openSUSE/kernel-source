Subject: [PATCH] xfs: truncate pagecache before writeback in
 xfs_setattr_size()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.8
Git-commit: 350976ae21873b0d36584ea005076356431b8f79

[ Upstream commit 350976ae21873b0d36584ea005076356431b8f79 ]

On truncate down, if new size is not block size aligned, we zero the
rest of block to avoid exposing stale data to user, and
iomap_truncate_page() skips zeroing if the range is already in
unwritten state or a hole. Then we writeback from on-disk i_size to
the new size if this range hasn't been written to disk yet, and
truncate page cache beyond new EOF and set in-core i_size.

The problem is that we could write data between di_size and newsize
before removing the page cache beyond newsize, as the extents may
still be in unwritten state right after a buffer write. As such, the
page of data that newsize lies in has not been zeroed by page cache
invalidation before it is written, and xfs_do_writepage() hasn't
triggered it's "zero data beyond EOF" case because we haven't
updated in-core i_size yet. Then a subsequent mmap read could see
non-zeros past EOF.

I occasionally see this in fsx runs in fstests generic/112, a
simplified fsx operation sequence is like (assuming 4k block size
xfs):

  fallocate 0x0 0x1000 0x0 keep_size
  write 0x0 0x1000 0x0
  truncate 0x0 0x800 0x1000
  punch_hole 0x0 0x800 0x800
  mapread 0x0 0x800 0x800

where fallocate allocates unwritten extent but doesn't update
i_size, buffer write populates the page cache and extent is still
unwritten, truncate skips zeroing page past new EOF and writes the
page to disk, punch_hole invalidates the page cache, at last mapread
reads the block back and sees non-zero beyond EOF.

Fix it by moving truncate_setsize() to before writeback so the page
cache invalidation zeros the partial page at the new EOF. This also
triggers "zero data beyond EOF" in xfs_do_writepage() at writeback
time, because newsize has been set and page straddles the newsize.

Also fixed the wrong 'end' param of filemap_write_and_wait_range()
call while we're at it, the 'end' is inclusive and should be
'newsize - 1'.
