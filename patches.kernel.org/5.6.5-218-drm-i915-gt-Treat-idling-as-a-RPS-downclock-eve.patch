Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915/gt: Treat idling as a RPS downclock event
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.5
Git-commit: 98479ada421a8fd2123b98efd398a6f1379307ab

commit 98479ada421a8fd2123b98efd398a6f1379307ab upstream.

If we park/unpark faster than we can respond to RPS events, we never
will process a downclock event after expiring a waitboost, and thus we
will forever restart the GPU at max clocks even if the workload switches
and doesn't justify full power.

Closes: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/intel/issues/1500
