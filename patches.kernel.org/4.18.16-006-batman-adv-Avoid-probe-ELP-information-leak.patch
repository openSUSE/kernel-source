Subject: [PATCH] batman-adv: Avoid probe ELP information leak
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.16
Git-commit: 88d0895d0ea9d4431507d576c963f2ff9918144d

[ Upstream commit 88d0895d0ea9d4431507d576c963f2ff9918144d ]

The probe ELPs for WiFi interfaces are expanded to contain at least
BATADV_ELP_MIN_PROBE_SIZE bytes. This is usually a lot more than the
number of bytes which the template ELP packet requires.

These extra padding bytes were not initialized and thus could contain data
which were previously stored at the same location. It is therefore required
to set it to some predefined or random values to avoid leaking private
information from the system transmitting these kind of packets.
