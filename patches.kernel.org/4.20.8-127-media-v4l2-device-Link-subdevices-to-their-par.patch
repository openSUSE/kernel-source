Subject: [PATCH] media: v4l2-device: Link subdevices to their parent devices
 if available
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.8
Git-commit: ee494cf377e142f65f202fadf0d859f8e12119fb

[ Upstream commit ee494cf377e142f65f202fadf0d859f8e12119fb ]

Currently v4l2_device_register_subdev_nodes() does not initialize the
dev_parent field of the video_device structs it creates for subdevices
being registered. This leads to __video_register_device() falling back
to the parent device of associated v4l2_device struct, which often does
not match the physical device the subdevice is registered for.

Due to the problem above, the links between real devices and v4l-subdev
nodes cannot be obtained from sysfs, which might be confusing for the
userspace trying to identify the hardware.

Fix this by initializing the dev_parent field of the video_device struct
with the value of dev field of the v4l2_subdev struct. In case of
subdevices without a parent struct device, the field will be NULL and the
old behavior will be preserved by the semantics of
__video_register_device().
