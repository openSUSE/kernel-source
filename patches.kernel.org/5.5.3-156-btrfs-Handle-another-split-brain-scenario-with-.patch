Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: Handle another split brain scenario with metadata uuid
 feature
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.3
Git-commit: 05840710149c7d1a78ea85a2db5723f706e97d8f

commit 05840710149c7d1a78ea85a2db5723f706e97d8f upstream.

There is one more cases which isn't handled by the original metadata
uuid work. Namely, when a filesystem has METADATA_UUID incompat bit and
the user decides to change the FSID to the original one e.g. have
metadata_uuid and fsid match. In case of power failure while this
operation is in progress we could end up in a situation where some of
the disks have the incompat bit removed and the other half have both
METADATA_UUID_INCOMPAT and FSID_CHANGING_IN_PROGRESS flags.

This patch handles the case where a disk that has successfully changed
its FSID such that it equals METADATA_UUID is scanned first.
Subsequently when a disk with both
METADATA_UUID_INCOMPAT/FSID_CHANGING_IN_PROGRESS flags is scanned
find_fsid_changed won't be able to find an appropriate btrfs_fs_devices.
This is done by extending find_fsid_changed to correctly find
btrfs_fs_devices whose metadata_uuid/fsid are the same and they match
the metadata_uuid of the currently scanned device.
