Subject: [PATCH] igb: Use smp_rmb rather than read_barrier_depends
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.3
Git-commit: c4cb99185b4cc96c0a1c70104dc21ae14d7e7f28

commit c4cb99185b4cc96c0a1c70104dc21ae14d7e7f28 upstream.

The original issue being fixed in this patch was seen with the ixgbe
driver, but the same issue exists with igb as well, as the code is
very similar. read_barrier_depends is not sufficient to ensure
loads following it are not speculatively loaded out of order
by the CPU, which can result in stale data being loaded, causing
potential system crashes.
