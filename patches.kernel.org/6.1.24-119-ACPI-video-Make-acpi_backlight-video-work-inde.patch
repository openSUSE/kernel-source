Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: video: Make acpi_backlight=video work independent from
 GPU driver
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.24
Git-commit: e506731c8f35699d746c615164ed620cd53c00ca

commit e506731c8f35699d746c615164ed620cd53c00ca upstream.

Commit 3dbc80a3e4c5 ("ACPI: video: Make backlight class device
registration a separate step (v2)") combined with
commit 5aa9d943e9b6 ("ACPI: video: Don't enable fallback path for
creating ACPI backlight by default")

Means that the video.ko code now fully depends on the GPU driver calling
acpi_video_register_backlight() for the acpi_video# backlight class
devices to get registered.

This means that if the GPU driver does not do this, acpi_backlight=video
on the cmdline, or DMI quirks for selecting acpi_video# will not work.

This is a problem on for example Apple iMac14,1 all-in-ones where
the monitor's LCD panel shows up as a regular DP connection instead of
eDP so the GPU driver will not call acpi_video_register_backlight() [1].

Fix this by making video.ko directly register the acpi_video# devices
when these have been explicitly requested either on the cmdline or
through DMI quirks (rather then auto-detection being used).

[1] GPU drivers only call acpi_video_register_backlight() when an internal
panel is detected, to avoid non working acpi_video# devices getting
registered on desktops which unfortunately is a real issue.
