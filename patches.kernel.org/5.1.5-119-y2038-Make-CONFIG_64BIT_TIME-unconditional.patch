Subject: [PATCH] y2038: Make CONFIG_64BIT_TIME unconditional
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.5
Git-commit: f3d964673b2f1c5d5c68c77273efcf7103eed03b

commit f3d964673b2f1c5d5c68c77273efcf7103eed03b upstream.

As Stepan Golosunov points out, there is a small mistake in the
get_timespec64() function in the kernel. It was originally added under the
assumption that CONFIG_64BIT_TIME would get enabled on all 32-bit and
64-bit architectures, but when the conversion was done, it was only turned
on for 32-bit ones.

The effect is that the get_timespec64() function never clears the upper
half of the tv_nsec field for 32-bit tasks in compat mode. Clearing this is
required for POSIX compliant behavior of functions that pass a 'timespec'
structure with a 64-bit tv_sec and a 32-bit tv_nsec, plus uninitialized
padding.

The easiest fix for linux-5.1 is to just make the Kconfig symbol
unconditional, as it was originally intended. As a follow-up, the #ifdef
CONFIG_64BIT_TIME can be removed completely..

Note: for native 32-bit mode, no change is needed, this works as
designed and user space should never need to clear the upper 32
bits of the tv_nsec field, in or out of the kernel.
