Subject: [PATCH] kthread_worker: fix return value when
 kthread_mod_delayed_work() races with kthread_cancel_delayed_work_sync()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.2
Git-commit: d71ba1649fa3c464c51ec7163e4b817345bff2c7

[ Upstream commit d71ba1649fa3c464c51ec7163e4b817345bff2c7 ]

kthread_mod_delayed_work() might race with
kthread_cancel_delayed_work_sync() or another kthread_mod_delayed_work()
call.  The function lets the other operation win when it sees
work->canceling counter set.  And it returns @false.

But it should return @true as it is done by the related workqueue API, see
mod_delayed_work_on().

The reason is that the return value might be used for reference counting.
It has to distinguish the case when the number of queued works has changed
or stayed the same.

The change is safe.  kthread_mod_delayed_work() return value is not
checked anywhere at the moment.
