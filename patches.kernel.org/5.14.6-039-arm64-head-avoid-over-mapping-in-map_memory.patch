Subject: [PATCH] arm64: head: avoid over-mapping in map_memory
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.6
Git-commit: 90268574a3e8a6b883bd802d702a2738577e1006

commit 90268574a3e8a6b883bd802d702a2738577e1006 upstream.

The `compute_indices` and `populate_entries` macros operate on inclusive
bounds, and thus the `map_memory` macro which uses them also operates
on inclusive bounds.

We pass `_end` and `_idmap_text_end` to `map_memory`, but these are
exclusive bounds, and if one of these is sufficiently aligned (as a
result of kernel configuration, physical placement, and KASLR), then:

* In `compute_indices`, the computed `iend` will be in the page/block *after*
  the final byte of the intended mapping.

* In `populate_entries`, an unnecessary entry will be created at the end
  of each level of table. At the leaf level, this entry will map up to
  SWAPPER_BLOCK_SIZE bytes of physical addresses that we did not intend
  to map.

As we may map up to SWAPPER_BLOCK_SIZE bytes more than intended, we may
violate the boot protocol and map physical address past the 2MiB-aligned
end address we are permitted to map. As we map these with Normal memory
attributes, this may result in further problems depending on what these
physical addresses correspond to.

The final entry at each level may require an additional table at that
level. As EARLY_ENTRIES() calculates an inclusive bound, we allocate
enough memory for this.

Avoid the extraneous mapping by having map_memory convert the exclusive
end address to an inclusive end address by subtracting one, and do
likewise in EARLY_ENTRIES() when calculating the number of required
tables. For clarity, comments are updated to more clearly document which
boundaries the macros operate on.  For consistency with the other
macros, the comments in map_memory are also updated to describe `vstart`
and `vend` as virtual addresses.
