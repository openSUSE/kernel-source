Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sm8250: correct compatible for sm8250-mtp
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.4
Git-commit: d371a931540bc36fd1199de3ec365a1187b7b282

[ Upstream commit d371a931540bc36fd1199de3ec365a1187b7b282 ]

Qualcomm boards should define two compatible strings: one for board,
anoter one for SoC family. sm8250-mtp.dts lists just the board
compatible, which makes it incompatible with qcom.yaml schema.
