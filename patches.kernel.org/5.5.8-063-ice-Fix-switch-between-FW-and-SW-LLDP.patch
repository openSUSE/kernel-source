Subject: [PATCH] ice: Fix switch between FW and SW LLDP
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.8
Git-commit: 53977ee47410885e7d4eee87d2c811a48a275150

[ Upstream commit 53977ee47410885e7d4eee87d2c811a48a275150 ]

When switching between FW and SW LLDP mode, the
number of configured TLV apps in the driver's
DCB configuration is getting out of synch with
what lldpad thinks is configured.  This is causing
a problem when shutting down lldpad.  The cleanup
is trying to delete TLV apps that are not defined
in the kernel.

Since the driver is keeping an accurate account
of the apps defined, use the drivers number of
apps to determine if there is an app to delete.
If the number of apps is <= 1, then do not
attempt to delete.
