commit 87e0d4f0f37fb0c8c4aeeac46fff5e957738df79 upstream.

Prasad reported that he has seen crashes in BPF subsystem with netd
on Android with arm64 in the form of (note, the taint is unrelated):

Android's netd was basically pinning the uid cookie BPF map in BPF
fs (/sys/fs/bpf/traffic_cookie_uid_map) and later on retrieving it
again resulting in above panic. Issue is that the map was wrongly
identified as a prog! Above kernel was compiled with clang 4.0,
and it turns out that clang decided to merge the bpf_prog_iops and
bpf_map_iops into a single memory location, such that the two i_ops
could then not be distinguished anymore.

Reason for this miscompilation is that clang has the more aggressive
-fmerge-all-constants enabled by default. In fact, clang source code
has a comment about it in lib/AST/ExprConstant.cpp on why it is okay
to do so:

  Pointers with different bases cannot represent the same object.
  (Note that clang defaults to -fmerge-all-constants, which can
  lead to inconsistent results for comparisons involving the address
  of a constant; this generally doesn't matter in practice.)

The issue never appeared with gcc however, since gcc does not enable
-fmerge-all-constants by default and even *explicitly* states in
it's option description that using this flag results in non-conforming
behavior, quote from man gcc:

  Languages like C or C++ require each variable, including multiple
  instances of the same variable in recursive calls, to have distinct
  locations, so using this option results in non-conforming behavior.

There are also various clang bug reports open on that matter [1],
where clang developers acknowledge the non-conforming behavior,
and refer to disabling it with -fno-merge-all-constants. But even
if this gets fixed in clang today, there are already users out there
that triggered this. Thus, fix this issue by explicitly adding
-fno-merge-all-constants to the kernel's Makefile to generically
disable this optimization, since potentially other places in the
kernel could subtly break as well.

Note, there is also a flag called -fmerge-constants (not supported
by clang), which is more conservative and only applies to strings
and it's enabled in gcc's -O/-O2/-O3/-Os optimization levels. In
gcc's code, the two flags -fmerge-{all-,}constants share the same
variable internally, so when disabling it via -fno-merge-all-constants,
then we really don't merge any const data (e.g. strings), and text
size increases with gcc (14,927,214 -> 14,942,646 for vmlinux.o).

  $ gcc -fverbose-asm -O2 foo.c -S -o foo.S
    -> foo.S lists -fmerge-constants under options enabled
  $ gcc -fverbose-asm -O2 -fno-merge-all-constants foo.c -S -o foo.S
    -> foo.S doesn't list -fmerge-constants under options enabled
  $ gcc -fverbose-asm -O2 -fno-merge-all-constants -fmerge-constants foo.c -S -o foo.S
    -> foo.S lists -fmerge-constants under options enabled

Thus, as a workaround we need to set both -fno-merge-all-constants
*and* -fmerge-constants in the Makefile in order for text size to
stay as is.
