Subject: [PATCH] Btrfs: send, fix race with transaction commits that create
 snapshots
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.1
Git-commit: be6821f82c3cc36e026f5afd10249988852b35ea

commit be6821f82c3cc36e026f5afd10249988852b35ea upstream.

If we create a snapshot of a snapshot currently being used by a send
operation, we can end up with send failing unexpectedly (returning
-ENOENT error to user space for example). The following diagram shows
how this happens.

                                                                        (...)

    -> uses an eb that now
       belongs to some other
       tree and no more matches
       the commit root of the
       snapshot, resuts will be
       unpredictable

The consequences of this race can be various, and can lead to searches in
the commit root performed by the send task failing unexpectedly (unable to
find inode items, returning -ENOENT to user space, for example) or not
failing because an inode item with the same number was added to the tree
that reused the metadata extent, in which case send can behave incorrectly
in the worst case or just fail later for some reason.

Fix this by performing a copy of the commit root's extent buffer when doing
a search in the context of a send operation.
