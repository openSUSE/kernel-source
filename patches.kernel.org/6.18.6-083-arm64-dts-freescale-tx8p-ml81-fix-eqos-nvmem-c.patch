Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: freescale: tx8p-ml81: fix eqos nvmem-cells
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.6
Git-commit: cdf4e631eec5ddd49bb625df9fb144d6ecdd6f15

[ Upstream commit cdf4e631eec5ddd49bb625df9fb144d6ecdd6f15 ]

On this SoM eqos is the primary ethernet interface, Ka-Ro fuses the
address for it in eth_mac1, eth_mac2 seems to be left unfused. In their
downstream u-boot they fetch it from eth_mac1 [1][2], by setting alias
of eqos to ethernet0, the driver then fetches the mac address based on
the alias number.

Set eqos to read from eth_mac1 instead of eth_mac2. Also set fec to
point at eth_mac2 as it may be fused later even though it is disabled
by default.

With this changed barebox is now capable of loading the correct address.
