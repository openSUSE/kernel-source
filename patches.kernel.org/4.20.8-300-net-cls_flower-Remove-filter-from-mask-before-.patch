Subject: [PATCH] net: cls_flower: Remove filter from mask before freeing it
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.8
Git-commit: c1f7e02979edd7a3a3e69fe04be60b1d650dc8a7

[ Upstream commit c1f7e02979edd7a3a3e69fe04be60b1d650dc8a7 ]

In fl_change(), when adding a new rule (i.e. fold == NULL), a driver may
reject the new rule, for example due to resource exhaustion. By that
point, the new rule was already assigned a mask, and it was added to
that mask's hash table. The clean-up path that's invoked as a result of
the rejection however neglects to undo the hash table addition, and
proceeds to free the new rule, thus leaving a dangling pointer in the
hash table.

Fix by removing fnew from the mask's hash table before it is freed.

Fixes: 35cc3cefc4de ("net/sched: cls_flower: Reject duplicated rules also under skip_sw")
