commit f54db39fbe40731c40aefdd3bc26e7d56d668c64 upstream.

Commit 062cfab7069f ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Make VP block size
configurable") updated kvmppc_xive_vcpu_id_valid() in a way that
allows userspace to trigger an assertion in skiboot and crash the host:

[  696.186248988,3] XIVE[ IC 08  ] eq_blk != vp_blk (0 vs. 1) for target 0x4300008c/0

XIVE maintains the interrupt context state of non-dispatched vCPUs in
an internal VP structure. We allocate a bunch of those on startup to
accommodate all possible vCPUs. Each VP has an id, that we derive from
the vCPU id for efficiency:

static inline u32 kvmppc_xive_vp(struct kvmppc_xive *xive, u32 server)
{
	return xive->vp_base + kvmppc_pack_vcpu_id(xive->kvm, server);
}

The KVM XIVE device used to allocate KVM_MAX_VCPUS VPs. This was
limitting the number of concurrent VMs because the VP space is
limited on the HW. Since most of the time, VMs run with a lot less
vCPUs, commit 062cfab7069f ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Make VP
block size configurable") gave the possibility for userspace to
tune the size of the VP block through the KVM_DEV_XIVE_NR_SERVERS
attribute.

The check in kvmppc_pack_vcpu_id() was changed from

	cpu < KVM_MAX_VCPUS * xive->kvm->arch.emul_smt_mode

to

	cpu < xive->nr_servers * xive->kvm->arch.emul_smt_mode

The previous check was based on the fact that the VP block had
KVM_MAX_VCPUS entries and that kvmppc_pack_vcpu_id() guarantees
that packed vCPU ids are below KVM_MAX_VCPUS. We've changed the
size of the VP block, but kvmppc_pack_vcpu_id() has nothing to
do with it and it certainly doesn't ensure that the packed vCPU
ids are below xive->nr_servers. kvmppc_xive_vcpu_id_valid() might
thus return true when the VM was configured with a non-standard
VSMT mode, even if the packed vCPU id is higher than what we
expect. We end up using an unallocated VP id, which confuses
OPAL. The assert in OPAL is probably abusive and should be
converted to a regular error that the kernel can handle, but
we shouldn't really use broken VP ids in the first place.

Fix kvmppc_xive_vcpu_id_valid() so that it checks the packed
vCPU id is below xive->nr_servers, which is explicitly what we
want.
