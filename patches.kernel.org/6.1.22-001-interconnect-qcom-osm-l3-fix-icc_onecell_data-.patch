Subject: [PATCH] interconnect: qcom: osm-l3: fix icc_onecell_data allocation
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.22
Git-commit: f77ebdda0ee652124061c2ac42399bb6c367e729

[ Upstream commit f77ebdda0ee652124061c2ac42399bb6c367e729 ]

This is a struct with a trailing zero-length array of icc_node pointers
but it's allocated as if it were a single array of icc_nodes instead.

Fortunately this overallocates memory rather then allocating less memory
than required.

Fix by replacing devm_kcalloc() with devm_kzalloc() and struct_size()
macro.
