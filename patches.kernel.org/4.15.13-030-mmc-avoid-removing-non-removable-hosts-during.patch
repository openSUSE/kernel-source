Subject: [PATCH] mmc: avoid removing non-removable hosts during suspend
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.13
Git-commit: de8dcc3d2c0e08e5068ee1e26fc46415c15e3637

[ Upstream commit de8dcc3d2c0e08e5068ee1e26fc46415c15e3637 ]

The Weibu F3C MiniPC has an onboard AP6255 module, presenting
two SDIO functions on a single MMC host (Bluetooth/btsdio and
WiFi/brcmfmac), and the mmc layer correctly detects this as
non-removable.

After suspend/resume, the wifi and bluetooth interfaces disappear
and do not get probed again.

The conditions here are:

 1. During suspend, we reach mmc_pm_notify()

 2. mmc_pm_notify() calls mmc_sdio_pre_suspend() to see if we can
    suspend the SDIO host. However, mmc_sdio_pre_suspend() returns
    -ENOSYS because btsdio_driver does not have a suspend method.

 3. mmc_pm_notify() proceeds to remove the card

 4. Upon resume, mmc_rescan() does nothing with this host, because of
    the rescan_entered check which aims to only scan a non-removable
    device a single time (i.e. during boot).

Fix the loss of functionality by detecting that we are unable to
suspend a non-removable host, so avoid the forced removal in that
case. The comment above this function already indicates that this
code was only intended for removable devices.
