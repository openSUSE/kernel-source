Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/hdmi - Read the pin sense from register when
 repolling
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.4
Git-commit: 8c2e6728c2bf95765b724e07d0278ae97cd1ee0d

commit 8c2e6728c2bf95765b724e07d0278ae97cd1ee0d upstream.

The driver will check the monitor presence when resuming from suspend,
starting poll or interrupt triggers. In these 3 situations, the
jack_dirty will be set to 1 first, then the hda_jack.c reads the
pin_sense from register, after reading the register, the jack_dirty
will be set to 0. But hdmi_repoll_work() is enabled in these 3
situations, It will read the pin_sense a couple of times subsequently,
since the jack_dirty is 0 now, It does not read the register anymore,
instead it uses the shadow pin_sense which is read at the first time.

It is meaningless to check the shadow pin_sense a couple of times,
we need to read the register to check the real plugging state, so
we set the jack_dirty to 1 in the hdmi_repoll_work().
