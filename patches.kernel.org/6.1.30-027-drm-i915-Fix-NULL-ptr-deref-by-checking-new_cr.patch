Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: Fix NULL ptr deref by checking new_crtc_state
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.30
Git-commit: a41d985902c153c31c616fe183cf2ee331e95ecb

[ Upstream commit a41d985902c153c31c616fe183cf2ee331e95ecb ]

intel_atomic_get_new_crtc_state can return NULL, unless crtc state wasn't
obtained previously with intel_atomic_get_crtc_state, so we must check it
for NULLness here, just as in many other places, where we can't guarantee
that intel_atomic_get_crtc_state was called.
We are currently getting NULL ptr deref because of that, so this fix was
confirmed to help.
