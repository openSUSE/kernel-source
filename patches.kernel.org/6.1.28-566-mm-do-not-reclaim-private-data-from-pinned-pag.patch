Subject: [PATCH] mm: do not reclaim private data from pinned page
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.28
Git-commit: d824ec2a154677f63c56cc71ffe4578274f6e32e

commit d824ec2a154677f63c56cc71ffe4578274f6e32e upstream.

If the page is pinned, there's no point in trying to reclaim it.
Furthermore if the page is from the page cache we don't want to reclaim
fs-private data from the page because the pinning process may be writing
to the page at any time and reclaiming fs private info on a dirty page can
upset the filesystem (see link below).
