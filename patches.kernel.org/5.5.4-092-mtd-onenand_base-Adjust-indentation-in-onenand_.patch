Subject: [PATCH] mtd: onenand_base: Adjust indentation in
 onenand_read_ops_nolock
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.4
Git-commit: 0e7ca83e82d021c928dadf4c13c137d57337540d

commit 0e7ca83e82d021c928dadf4c13c137d57337540d upstream.

Clang warns:

../drivers/mtd/nand/onenand/onenand_base.c:1269:3: warning: misleading
indentation; statement is not part of the previous 'if'
[-Wmisleading-indentation]
        while (!ret) {
        ^
../drivers/mtd/nand/onenand/onenand_base.c:1266:2: note: previous
statement is here
        if (column + thislen > writesize)
        ^
1 warning generated.

This warning occurs because there is a space before the tab of the while
loop. There are spaces at the beginning of a lot of the lines in this
block, remove them so that the indentation is consistent with the Linux
kernel coding style and clang no longer warns.
