Subject: [PATCH] arm64: KVM: Add SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_1 fast handling
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.4
Git-commit: 4a345e5e87310a898696806705a0f054be2aae09

Commit f72af90c3783 upstream.

We want SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_1 to be fast. As fast as possible.
So let's intercept it as early as we can by testing for the
function call number as soon as we've identified a HVC call
coming from the guest.
