Subject: [PATCH] x86/entry/64: Fix CR3 restore in paranoid_exit()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.5
Git-commit: e48657573481a5dff7cfdc3d57005c80aa816500

commit e48657573481a5dff7cfdc3d57005c80aa816500 upstream.

Josh Poimboeuf noticed the following bug:

 "The paranoid exit code only restores the saved CR3 when it switches back
  to the user GS.  However, even in the kernel GS case, it's possible that
  it needs to restore a user CR3, if for example, the paranoid exception
  occurred in the syscall exit path between SWITCH_TO_USER_CR3_STACK and
  SWAPGS."

Josh also confirmed via targeted testing that it's possible to hit this bug.

Fix the bug by also restoring CR3 in the paranoid_exit_no_swapgs branch.

The reason we haven't seen this bug reported by users yet is probably because
"paranoid" entry points are limited to the following cases:

 idtentry double_fault       do_double_fault  has_error_code=1  paranoid=2
 idtentry debug              do_debug         has_error_code=0  paranoid=1 shift_ist=DEBUG_STACK
 idtentry int3               do_int3          has_error_code=0  paranoid=1 shift_ist=DEBUG_STACK
 idtentry machine_check      do_mce           has_error_code=0  paranoid=1

Amongst those entry points only machine_check is one that will interrupt an
IRQS-off critical section asynchronously - and machine check events are rare.

The other main asynchronous entries are NMI entries, which can be very high-freq
with perf profiling, but they are special: they don't use the 'idtentry' macro but
are open coded and restore user CR3 unconditionally so don't have this bug.
