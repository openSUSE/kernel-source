Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/hdmi: Preserve the previous PCM device upon
 re-enablement
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.24
Git-commit: f785f5ee968f7045268b8be6b0abc850c4a4277c

[ Upstream commit f785f5ee968f7045268b8be6b0abc850c4a4277c ]

When a DRM driver turns on or off the screen with the audio
capability, it notifies the ELD to HD-audio HDMI codec driver via
component ops.  HDMI codec driver, in turn, attaches or detaches the
PCM stream for the given port on the fly.

The problem is that, since the recent code change, the HDMI driver
always treats the PCM stream assignment dynamically; this ended up the
confusion of the PCM device appearance.  e.g. when a screen goes once
off and on again, it may appear on a different PCM device before the
screen-off.  Although the application should treat such a change, it
doesn't seem working gracefully with the current pipewire (maybe
PulseAudio, too).

As a workaround, this patch changes the HDMI codec driver behavior
slightly to be more consistent.  Now it remembers the previous PCM
slot for the given port and try to assign to it.  That is, if a port
is re-enabled, the driver tries to use the same PCM slot that was
assigned to that port previously.  If it conflicts, a new slot is
searched and used like before, instead.

Note that multiple monitor connections are the only typical case where
the PCM slot preservation is effective.  As long as only a single
monitor is connected, the behavior isn't changed, and the first PCM
slot is still assigned always.
