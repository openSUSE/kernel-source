Subject: [PATCH] ipv6: Reflect MTU changes on PMTU of exceptions for MTU-less
 routes
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.15
Git-commit: e9fa1495d738e34fcec88a3d2ec9101a9ee5b310

[ Upstream commit e9fa1495d738e34fcec88a3d2ec9101a9ee5b310 ]

Currently, administrative MTU changes on a given netdevice are
not reflected on route exceptions for MTU-less routes, with a
set PMTU value, for that device:

 # ip -6 route get 2001:db8::b
 2001:db8::b from :: dev vti_a proto kernel src 2001:db8::a metric 256 pref medium
 # ping6 -c 1 -q -s10000 2001:db8::b > /dev/null
 # ip netns exec a ip -6 route get 2001:db8::b
 2001:db8::b from :: dev vti_a src 2001:db8::a metric 0
     cache expires 571sec mtu 4926 pref medium
 # ip link set dev vti_a mtu 3000
 # ip -6 route get 2001:db8::b
 2001:db8::b from :: dev vti_a src 2001:db8::a metric 0
     cache expires 571sec mtu 4926 pref medium
 # ip link set dev vti_a mtu 9000
 # ip -6 route get 2001:db8::b
 2001:db8::b from :: dev vti_a src 2001:db8::a metric 0
     cache expires 571sec mtu 4926 pref medium

The first issue is that since commit fb56be83e43d ("net-ipv6: on
device mtu change do not add mtu to mtu-less routes") we don't
call rt6_exceptions_update_pmtu() from rt6_mtu_change_route(),
which handles administrative MTU changes, if the regular route
is MTU-less.

However, PMTU exceptions should be always updated, as long as
RTAX_MTU is not locked. Keep the check for MTU-less main route,
as introduced by that commit, but, for exceptions,
call rt6_exceptions_update_pmtu() regardless of that check.

Once that is fixed, one problem remains: MTU changes are not
reflected if the new MTU is higher than the previous one,
because rt6_exceptions_update_pmtu() doesn't allow that. We
should instead allow PMTU increase if the old PMTU matches the
local MTU, as that implies that the old MTU was the lowest in the
path, and PMTU discovery might lead to different results.

The existing check in rt6_mtu_change_route() correctly took that
case into account (for regular routes only), so factor it out
and re-use it also in rt6_exceptions_update_pmtu().

While at it, fix comments style and grammar, and try to be a bit
more descriptive.
