Subject: [PATCH] PM / OPP: Update performance state when freq == old_freq
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.4
Git-commit: faef080f6db5320011862f7baf1aa66d0851559f

commit faef080f6db5320011862f7baf1aa66d0851559f upstream.

At boot up, CPUFreq core performs a sanity check to see if the system is
running at a frequency defined in the frequency table of the CPU. If so,
we try to find a valid frequency (lowest frequency greater than the
currently programmed frequency) from the table and set it. When the call
reaches dev_pm_opp_set_rate(), it calls _find_freq_ceil(opp_table,
&old_freq) to find the previously configured OPP and this call also
updates the old_freq. This eventually sets the old_freq == freq (new
target requested by cpufreq core) and we skip updating the performance
state in this case.

Fix this by also updating the performance state when the old_freq ==
freq.
