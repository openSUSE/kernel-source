Subject: [PATCH] i2c: dev: prevent adapter retries and timeout being set as
 minus value
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.3
Git-commit: 6ebec961d59bccf65d08b13fc1ad4e6272a89338

commit 6ebec961d59bccf65d08b13fc1ad4e6272a89338 upstream.

If adapter->retries is set to a minus value from user space via ioctl,
it will make __i2c_transfer and __i2c_smbus_xfer skip the calling to
adapter->algo->master_xfer and adapter->algo->smbus_xfer that is
registered by the underlying bus drivers, and return value 0 to all the
callers. The bus driver will never be accessed anymore by all users,
besides, the users may still get successful return value without any
error or information log print out.

If adapter->timeout is set to minus value from user space via ioctl,
it will make the retrying loop in __i2c_transfer and __i2c_smbus_xfer
always break after the the first try, due to the time_after always
returns true.
