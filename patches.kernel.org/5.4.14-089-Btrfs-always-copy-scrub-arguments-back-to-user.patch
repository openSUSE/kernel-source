Subject: [PATCH] Btrfs: always copy scrub arguments back to user space
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.14
Git-commit: 5afe6ce748c1ea99e0d648153c05075e1ab93afb

commit 5afe6ce748c1ea99e0d648153c05075e1ab93afb upstream.

If scrub returns an error we are not copying back the scrub arguments
structure to user space. This prevents user space to know how much
progress scrub has done if an error happened - this includes -ECANCELED
which is returned when users ask for scrub to stop. A particular use
case, which is used in btrfs-progs, is to resume scrub after it is
canceled, in that case it relies on checking the progress from the scrub
arguments structure and then use that progress in a call to resume
scrub.

So fix this by always copying the scrub arguments structure to user
space, overwriting the value returned to user space with -EFAULT only if
copying the structure failed to let user space know that either that
copying did not happen, and therefore the structure is stale, or it
happened partially and the structure is probably not valid and corrupt
due to the partial copy.
