Subject: [PATCH] structleak: disable STRUCTLEAK_BYREF in combination with
 KASAN_STACK
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.5
Git-commit: 173e6ee21e2b3f477f07548a79c43b8d9cfbb37d

commit 173e6ee21e2b3f477f07548a79c43b8d9cfbb37d upstream.

The combination of KASAN_STACK and GCC_PLUGIN_STRUCTLEAK_BYREF
leads to much larger kernel stack usage, as seen from the warnings
about functions that now exceed the 2048 byte limit:

The structleak plugin was previously disabled for CONFIG_COMPILE_TEST,
but meant we missed some bugs, so this time we should address them.

The frame size warnings are distracting, and risking a kernel stack
overflow is generally not beneficial to performance, so it may be best
to disallow that particular combination. This can be done by turning
off either one. I picked the dependency in GCC_PLUGIN_STRUCTLEAK_BYREF
and GCC_PLUGIN_STRUCTLEAK_BYREF_ALL, as this option is designed to
make uninitialized stack usage less harmful when enabled on its own,
but it also prevents KASAN from detecting those cases in which it was
in fact needed.

KASAN_STACK is currently implied by KASAN on gcc, but could be made a
user selectable option if we want to allow combining (non-stack) KASAN
with GCC_PLUGIN_STRUCTLEAK_BYREF.

Note that it would be possible to specifically address the files that
print the warning, but presumably the overall stack usage is still
significantly higher than in other configurations, so this would not
address the full problem.

I could not test this with CONFIG_INIT_STACK_ALL, which may or may not
suffer from a similar problem.
