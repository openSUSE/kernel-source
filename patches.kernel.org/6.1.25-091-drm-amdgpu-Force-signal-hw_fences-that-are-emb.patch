Subject: [PATCH] drm/amdgpu: Force signal hw_fences that are embedded in
 non-sched jobs
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.25
Git-commit: 033c56474acf567a450f8bafca50e0b610f2b716

[ Upstream commit 033c56474acf567a450f8bafca50e0b610f2b716 ]

[Why]
For engines not supporting soft reset, i.e. VCN, there will be a failed
ib test before mode 1 reset during asic reset. The fences in this case
are never signaled and next time when we try to free the sa_bo, kernel
will hang.

[How]
During pre_asic_reset, driver will clear job fences and afterwards the
fences' refcount will be reduced to 1. For drm_sched_jobs it will be
released in job_free_cb, and for non-sched jobs like ib_test, it's meant
to be released in sa_bo_free but only when the fences are signaled. So
we have to force signal the non_sched bad job's fence during
pre_asic_reset or the clear is not complete.
