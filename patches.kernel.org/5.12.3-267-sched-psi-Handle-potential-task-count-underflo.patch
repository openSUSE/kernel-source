Subject: [PATCH] sched,psi: Handle potential task count underflow bugs more
 gracefully
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.3
Git-commit: 9d10a13d1e4c349b76f1c675a874a7f981d6d3b4

[ Upstream commit 9d10a13d1e4c349b76f1c675a874a7f981d6d3b4 ]

psi_group_cpu->tasks, represented by the unsigned int, stores the
number of tasks that could be stalled on a psi resource(io/mem/cpu).
Decrementing these counters at zero leads to wrapping which further
leads to the psi_group_cpu->state_mask is being set with the
respective pressure state. This could result into the unnecessary time
sampling for the pressure state thus cause the spurious psi events.
This can further lead to wrong actions being taken at the user land
based on these psi events.

Though psi_bug is set under these conditions but that just for debug
purpose. Fix it by decrementing the ->tasks count only when it is
non-zero.
