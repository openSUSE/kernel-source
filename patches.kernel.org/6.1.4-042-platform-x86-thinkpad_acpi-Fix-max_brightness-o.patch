[ Upstream commit db5e2a4ca0a7a5fe54f410590292ea2e91de6798 ]

Thinklight has only two values, on/off so it's reasonable for
max_brightness to be 0 and 1 as if you write anything between 0 and 255
it will be 255 anyway so there's no point for it to be 255.

This may look like it is a userspace API change, but writes with
a value larget then the new max_brightness will still be accepted,
these will be silently clamped to the new max_brightness by
led_set_brightness_nosleep(). So no userspace API problems are
expected.
