Subject: [PATCH] arm64/hugetlb: fix CMA gigantic page order for non-4K
 PAGE_SIZE
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.14
Git-commit: 2e5809a4ddb15969503e43b06662a9a725f613ea

commit 2e5809a4ddb15969503e43b06662a9a725f613ea upstream.

For non-4K PAGE_SIZE configs, the largest gigantic huge page size is
CONT_PMD_SHIFT order. On arm64 with 64K PAGE_SIZE, the gigantic page is
16G. Therefore, one should be able to specify 'hugetlb_cma=16G' on the
kernel command line so that one gigantic page can be allocated from CMA.
However, when adding such an option the following message is produced:

hugetlb_cma: cma area should be at least 8796093022208 MiB

This is because the calculation for non-4K gigantic page order is
incorrect in the arm64 specific routine arm64_hugetlb_cma_reserve().

Fixes: abb7962adc80 ("arm64/hugetlb: Reserve CMA areas for gigantic pages on 16K and 64K configs")
