Subject: [PATCH] i2c: imx-lpi2c: change to PIO mode in system-wide
 suspend/resume progress
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.7
Git-commit: f2a3f51365bf672dab4b58d1e8954926a9196b44

[ Upstream commit f2a3f51365bf672dab4b58d1e8954926a9196b44 ]

EDMA resumes early and suspends late in the system power transition
sequence, while LPI2C enters the NOIRQ stage for both suspend and resume.
This means LPI2C resources become available before EDMA is fully resumed.
Once IRQs are enabled, a slave device may immediately trigger an LPI2C
transfer. If the transfer length meets DMA requirements, the driver will
attempt to use EDMA even though EDMA may still be unavailable.

This timing gap can lead to transfer failures. To prevent this, force
LPI2C to use PIO mode during system-wide suspend and resume transitions.
This reduces dependency on EDMA and avoids using an unready DMA resource.
