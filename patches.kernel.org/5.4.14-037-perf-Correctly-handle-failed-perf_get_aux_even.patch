Subject: [PATCH] perf: Correctly handle failed perf_get_aux_event()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.14
Git-commit: da9ec3d3dd0f1240a48920be063448a2242dbd90

commit da9ec3d3dd0f1240a48920be063448a2242dbd90 upstream.

Vince reports a worrying issue:

| so I was tracking down some odd behavior in the perf_fuzzer which turns
| out to be because perf_even_open() sometimes returns 0 (indicating a file
| descriptor of 0) even though as far as I can tell stdin is still open.

... and further the cause:

| error is triggered if aux_sample_size has non-zero value.
|
| seems to be this line in kernel/events/core.c:
|
| if (perf_need_aux_event(event) && !perf_get_aux_event(event, group_leader))
|                goto err_locked;
|
| (note, err is never set)

This seems to be a thinko in commit:

  ab43762ef010967e ("perf: Allow normal events to output AUX data")

... and we should probably return -EINVAL here, as this should only
happen when the new event is mis-configured or does not have a
compatible aux_event group leader.

Fixes: ab43762ef010967e ("perf: Allow normal events to output AUX data")
