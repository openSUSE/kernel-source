Subject: [PATCH] tty: Handle problem if line discipline does not have
 receive_buf
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.6
Git-commit: 27cfb3a53be46a54ec5e0bd04e51995b74c90343

commit 27cfb3a53be46a54ec5e0bd04e51995b74c90343 upstream.

Some tty line disciplines do not have a receive buf callback, so
properly check for that before calling it.  If they do not have this
callback, just eat the character quietly, as we can't fail this call.
