Subject: [PATCH] regulator: core: Avoid potential deadlock on
 regulator_unregister
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.6
Git-commit: 063773011d33bb36588a90385aa9eb75d13c6d80

[ Upstream commit 063773011d33bb36588a90385aa9eb75d13c6d80 ]

Lockdep reports the following issue on my setup:

Possible unsafe locking scenario:

CPU0                    CPU1
----                    ----
lock((work_completion)(&(&rdev->disable_work)->work));
                        lock(regulator_list_mutex);
                        lock((work_completion)(&(&rdev->disable_work)->work));
lock(regulator_list_mutex);

The problem is that regulator_unregister takes the
regulator_list_mutex and then calls flush_work on disable_work. But
regulator_disable_work calls regulator_lock_dependent which will
also take the regulator_list_mutex. Resulting in a deadlock if the
flush_work call actually needs to flush the work.

Fix this issue by moving the flush_work outside of the
regulator_list_mutex. The list mutex is not used to guard the point at
which the delayed work is queued, so its use adds no additional safety.
