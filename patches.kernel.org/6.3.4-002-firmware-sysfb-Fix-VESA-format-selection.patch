Subject: [PATCH] firmware/sysfb: Fix VESA format selection
Patch-mainline: 6.3.4
References: bsc#1012628 bsc#1211119
Git-commit: 1b617bc93178912fa36f87a957c15d1f1708c299

[ Upstream commit 1b617bc93178912fa36f87a957c15d1f1708c299 ]

Some legacy BIOSes report no reserved bits in their 32-bit rgb mode,
breaking the calculation of bits_per_pixel in  commit f35cd3fa7729
("firmware/sysfb: Fix EFI/VESA format selection").  However they report
lfb_depth correctly for those modes.  Keep the computation but
set bits_per_pixel to lfb_depth if the latter is larger.

v2 fixes the warnings from a max3() macro with arguments of different
types;  split the bits_per_pixel assignment to avoid uglyfing the code
with too many typecasts.

v3 fixes space and formatting blips pointed out by Javier, and change
the bit_per_pixel assignment back to a single statement using two casts.

v4 go back to v2 and use max_t()
