Subject: [PATCH] cpufreq: Fix new policy initialization during limits updates
 via sysfs
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.3
Git-commit: c7d1f119c48f64bebf0fa1e326af577c6152fe30

commit c7d1f119c48f64bebf0fa1e326af577c6152fe30 upstream.

If the policy limits are updated via cpufreq_update_policy() and
subsequently via sysfs, the limits stored in user_policy may be
set incorrectly.

For example, if both min and max are set via sysfs to the maximum
available frequency, user_policy.min and user_policy.max will also
be the maximum.  If a policy notifier triggered by
cpufreq_update_policy() lowers both the min and the max at this
point, that change is not reflected by the user_policy limits, so
if the max is updated again via sysfs to the same lower value,
then user_policy.max will be lower than user_policy.min which
shouldn't happen.  In particular, if one of the policy CPUs is
then taken offline and back online, cpufreq_set_policy() will
fail for it due to a failing limits check.

To prevent that from happening, initialize the min and max fields
of the new_policy object to the ones stored in user_policy that
were previously set via sysfs.
