Subject: [PATCH] backlight: led-bl: Add devlink to supplier LEDs
References: bsc#1012628 CVE-2025-68758 bsc#1255944
Patch-mainline: 6.18.2
Git-commit: 9341d6698f4cfdfc374fb6944158d111ebe16a9d

[ Upstream commit 9341d6698f4cfdfc374fb6944158d111ebe16a9d ]

LED Backlight is a consumer of one or multiple LED class devices, but
devlink is currently unable to create correct supplier-producer links when
the supplier is a class device. It creates instead a link where the
supplier is the parent of the expected device.

One consequence is that removal order is not correctly enforced.

Issues happen for example with the following sections in a device tree
overlay:

    // An LED driver chip
    pca9632@62 {
        compatible = "nxp,pca9632";
        reg = <0x62>;

	// ...

        addon_led_pwm: led-pwm@3 {
            reg = <3>;
            label = "addon:led:pwm";
        };
    };

    backlight-addon {
        compatible = "led-backlight";
        leds = <&addon_led_pwm>;
        brightness-levels = <255>;
        default-brightness-level = <255>;
    };

In this example, the devlink should be created between the backlight-addon
(consumer) and the pca9632@62 (supplier). Instead it is created between the
backlight-addon (consumer) and the parent of the pca9632@62, which is
typically the I2C bus adapter.

On removal of the above overlay, the LED driver can be removed before the
backlight device, resulting in:

    Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000010
    ...
    Call trace:
     led_put+0xe0/0x140
     devm_led_release+0x6c/0x98

Another way to reproduce the bug without any device tree overlays is
unbinding the LED class device (pca9632@62) before unbinding the consumer
(backlight-addon):

  echo 11-0062 >/sys/bus/i2c/drivers/leds-pca963x/unbind
  echo ...backlight-dock >/sys/bus/platform/drivers/led-backlight/unbind

Fix by adding a devlink between the consuming led-backlight device and the
supplying LED device, as other drivers and subsystems do as well.
