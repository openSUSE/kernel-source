Subject: [PATCH] irqchip/apple-aic: Fix irq_disable from within irq handlers
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.4
Git-commit: 60a1cd10b222e004f860d14651e80089c77e8e6b

[ Upstream commit 60a1cd10b222e004f860d14651e80089c77e8e6b ]

When disable_irq_nosync for an interrupt is called from within its
interrupt handler, this interrupt is only marked as disabled with the
intention to mask it when it triggers again.
The AIC hardware however automatically masks the interrupt when it is read.
aic_irq_eoi then unmasks it again if it's not disabled *and* not masked.
This results in a state mismatch between the hardware state and the
state kept in irq_data: The hardware interrupt is masked but
IRQD_IRQ_MASKED is not set. Any further calls to unmask_irq will directly
return and the interrupt can never be enabled again.

Fix this by keeping the hardware and irq_data state in sync by unmasking in
aic_irq_eoi if and only if the irq_data state also assumes the interrupt to
be unmasked.
