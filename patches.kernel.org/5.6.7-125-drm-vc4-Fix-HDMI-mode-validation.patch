Subject: [PATCH] drm/vc4: Fix HDMI mode validation
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.7
Git-commit: b1e7396a1d0e6af6806337fdaaa44098d6b3343c

[ Upstream commit b1e7396a1d0e6af6806337fdaaa44098d6b3343c ]

Current mode validation impedes setting up some video modes which should
be supported otherwise. Namely 1920x1200@60Hz.

Fix this by lowering the minimum HDMI state machine clock to pixel clock
ratio allowed.

Fixes: 32e823c63e90 ("drm/vc4: Reject HDMI modes with too high of clocks.")
