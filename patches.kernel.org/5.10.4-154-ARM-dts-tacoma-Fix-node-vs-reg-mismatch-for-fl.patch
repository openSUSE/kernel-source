Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: tacoma: Fix node vs reg mismatch for flash memory
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.4
Git-commit: cbee028da69d31cb927142e2828710de55a49f2a

[ Upstream commit cbee028da69d31cb927142e2828710de55a49f2a ]

The mismatch lead to a miscalculation of regions in another patch, and
shouldn't be mismatched anyway, so make them consistent.
