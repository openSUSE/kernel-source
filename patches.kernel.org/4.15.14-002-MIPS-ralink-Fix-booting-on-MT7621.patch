Subject: [PATCH] MIPS: ralink: Fix booting on MT7621
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.14
Git-commit: a63d706ea719190a79a6c769e898f70680044d3e

commit a63d706ea719190a79a6c769e898f70680044d3e upstream.

Since commit 3af5a67c86a3 ("MIPS: Fix early CM probing") the MT7621 has
not been able to boot.

This commit caused mips_cm_probe() to be called before
mt7621.c::proc_soc_init().

prom_soc_init() has a comment explaining that mips_cm_probe() "wipes out
the bootloader config" and means that configuration registers are no
longer available. It has some code to re-enable this config.

Before this re-enable code is run, the sysc register cannot be read, so
when SYSC_REG_CHIP_NAME0 is read, a garbage value is returned and
panic() is called.

If we move the config-repair code to the top of prom_soc_init(), the
registers can be read and boot can proceed.

Very occasionally, the first register read after the reconfiguration
returns garbage, so add a call to __sync().
