Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: es8328: fix route from DAC to output
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.6
Git-commit: 5b0c02f9b8acf2a791e531bbc09acae2d51f4f9b

[ Upstream commit 5b0c02f9b8acf2a791e531bbc09acae2d51f4f9b ]

The ES8328 codec driver, which is also used for the ES8388 chip that
appears to have an identical register map, claims that the output can
either take the route from DAC->Mixer->Output or through DAC->Output
directly. To the best of what I could find, this is not true, and
creates problems.

Without DACCONTROL17 bit index 7 set for the left channel, as well as
DACCONTROL20 bit index 7 set for the right channel, I cannot get any
analog audio out on Left Out 2 and Right Out 2 respectively, despite the
DAPM routes claiming that this should be possible. Furthermore, the same
is the case for Left Out 1 and Right Out 1, showing that those two don't
have a direct route from DAC to output bypassing the mixer either.

Those control bits toggle whether the DACs are fed (stale bread?) into
their respective mixers. If one "unmutes" the mixer controls in
alsamixer, then sure, the audio output works, but if it doesn't work
without the mixer being fed the DAC input then evidently it's not a
direct output from the DAC.

ES8328/ES8388 are seemingly not alone in this. ES8323, which uses a
separate driver for what appears to be a very similar register map,
simply flips those two bits on in its probe function, and then pretends
there is no power management whatsoever for the individual controls.
Fair enough.

My theory as to why nobody has noticed this up to this point is that
everyone just assumes it's their fault when they had to unmute an
additional control in ALSA.

Fix this in the es8328 driver by removing the erroneous direct route,
then get rid of the playback switch controls and have those bits tied to
the mixer's widget instead, which until now had no register to play
with.
