Subject: [PATCH] serial: 8250: Don't service RX FIFO if interrupts are
 disabled
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.12
Git-commit: 2e9fe539108320820016f78ca7704a7342788380

[ Upstream commit 2e9fe539108320820016f78ca7704a7342788380 ]

Currently, data in RX FIFO is read based on UART_LSR register state even
if RDI and RLSI interrupts are disabled in UART_IER register.
This is because when IRQ handler is called due to TX FIFO empty event,
RX FIFO is serviced based on UART_LSR register status instead of
UART_IIR status. This defeats the purpose of disabling UART RX
FIFO interrupts during throttling(see, omap_8250_throttle()) as IRQ
handler continues to drain UART RX FIFO resulting in overflow of buffer
at tty layer.
Fix this by making sure that driver drains UART RX FIFO only when
UART_IIR_RDI is set along with UART_LSR_BI or UART_LSR_DR bits.
