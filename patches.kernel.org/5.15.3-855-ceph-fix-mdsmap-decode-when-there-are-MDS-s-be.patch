Subject: [PATCH] ceph: fix mdsmap decode when there are MDS's beyond max_mds
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.3
Git-commit: 0e24421ac431e7af62d4acef6c638b85aae51728

commit 0e24421ac431e7af62d4acef6c638b85aae51728 upstream.

If the max_mds is decreased in a cephfs cluster, there is a window
of time before the MDSs are removed. If a map goes out during this
period, the mdsmap may show the decreased max_mds but still shows
those MDSes as in or in the export target list.

Ensure that we don't fail the map decode in that case.
