Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: scrub: replace max_t()/min_t() with clamp() in
 scrub_throttle_dev_io()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.7
Git-commit: a7f3dfb8293c4cee99743132d69863a92e8f4875

[ Upstream commit a7f3dfb8293c4cee99743132d69863a92e8f4875 ]

Replace max_t() followed by min_t() with a single clamp().

As was pointed by David Laight in
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-btrfs/20250906122458.75dfc8f0@pumpkin/
the calculation may overflow u32 when the input value is too large, so
clamp_t() is not used.  In practice the expected values are in range of
megabytes to gigabytes (throughput limit) so the bug would not happen.
