Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: s5pv210: correct fuel gauge interrupt trigger level
 on Fascinate family
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.4
Git-commit: 214e6ec8c9f5a3353d3282b3ff475d3ee86cc21a

[ Upstream commit 214e6ec8c9f5a3353d3282b3ff475d3ee86cc21a ]

The Maxim fuel gauge datasheets describe the interrupt line as active
low with a requirement of acknowledge from the CPU.  The falling edge
interrupt will mostly work but it's not correct.
