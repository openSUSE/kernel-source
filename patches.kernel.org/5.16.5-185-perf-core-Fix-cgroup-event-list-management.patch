Subject: [PATCH] perf/core: Fix cgroup event list management
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.16.5
Git-commit: c5de60cd622a2607c043ba65e25a6e9998a369f9

commit c5de60cd622a2607c043ba65e25a6e9998a369f9 upstream.

The active cgroup events are managed in the per-cpu cgrp_cpuctx_list.
This list is only accessed from current cpu and not protected by any
locks.  But from the commit ef54c1a476ae ("perf: Rework
perf_event_exit_event()"), it's possible to access (actually modify)
the list from another cpu.

In the perf_remove_from_context(), it can remove an event from the
context without an IPI when the context is not active.  This is not
safe with cgroup events which can have some active events in the
context even if ctx->is_active is 0 at the moment.  The target cpu
might be in the middle of list iteration at the same time.

If the event is enabled when it's about to be closed, it might call
perf_cgroup_event_disable() and list_del() with the cgrp_cpuctx_list
on a different cpu.

This resulted in a crash due to an invalid list pointer access during
the cgroup list traversal on the cpu which the event belongs to.

Let's fallback to IPI to access the cgrp_cpuctx_list from that cpu.
Similarly, perf_install_in_context() should use IPI for the cgroup
events too.
