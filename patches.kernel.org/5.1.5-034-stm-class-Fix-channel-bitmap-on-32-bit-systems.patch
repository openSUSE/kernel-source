Subject: [PATCH] stm class: Fix channel bitmap on 32-bit systems
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.5
Git-commit: 51e0f227812ed81a368de54157ebe14396b4be03

commit 51e0f227812ed81a368de54157ebe14396b4be03 upstream.

Commit 7bd1d4093c2f ("stm class: Introduce an abstraction for System Trace
Module devices") naively calculates the channel bitmap size in 64-bit
chunks regardless of the size of underlying unsigned long, making the
bitmap half as big on a 32-bit system. This leads to an out of bounds
access with the upper half of the bitmap.

Fix this by using BITS_TO_LONGS. While at it, convert to using
struct_size() for the total size calculation of the master struct.
