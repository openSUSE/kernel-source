Subject: [PATCH] scsi: NCR5380: Check for phase match during PDMA fixup
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.2
Git-commit: 5768718da9417331803fc4bc090544c2a93b88dc

[ Upstream commit 5768718da9417331803fc4bc090544c2a93b88dc ]

It's not an error for a target to change the bus phase during a transfer.
Unfortunately, the FLAG_DMA_FIXUP workaround does not allow for that -- a
phase change produces a DRQ timeout error and the device borken flag will
be set.

Check the phase match bit during FLAG_DMA_FIXUP processing. Don't forget to
decrement the command residual. While we are here, change shost_printk()
into scmd_printk() for better consistency with other DMA error messages.
