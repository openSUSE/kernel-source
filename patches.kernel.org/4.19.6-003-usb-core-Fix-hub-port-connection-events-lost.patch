Subject: [PATCH] usb: core: Fix hub port connection events lost
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.6
Git-commit: 22454b79e6de05fa61a2a72d00d2eed798abbb75

commit 22454b79e6de05fa61a2a72d00d2eed798abbb75 upstream.

This will clear the USB_PORT_FEAT_C_CONNECTION bit in case of a hub port reset
only if a device is was attached to the hub port before resetting the hub port.

Using a Lenovo T480s attached to the ultra dock it was not possible to detect
some usb-c devices at the dock usb-c ports because the hub_port_reset code
will clear the USB_PORT_FEAT_C_CONNECTION bit after the actual hub port reset.
Using this device combo the USB_PORT_FEAT_C_CONNECTION bit was set between the
actual hub port reset and the clear of the USB_PORT_FEAT_C_CONNECTION bit.
This ends up with clearing the USB_PORT_FEAT_C_CONNECTION bit after the
new device was attached such that it was not detected.

This patch will not clear the USB_PORT_FEAT_C_CONNECTION bit if there is
currently no device attached to the port before the hub port reset.
This will avoid clearing the connection bit for new attached devices.
