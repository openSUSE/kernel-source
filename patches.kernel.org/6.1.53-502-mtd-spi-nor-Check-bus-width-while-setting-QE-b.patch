Subject: [PATCH] mtd: spi-nor: Check bus width while setting QE bit
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.53
Git-commit: f01d8155a92e33cdaa85d20bfbe6c441907b3c1f

[ Upstream commit f01d8155a92e33cdaa85d20bfbe6c441907b3c1f ]

spi_nor_write_16bit_sr_and_check() should also check if bus width is
4 before setting QE bit.

Fixes: 39d1e3340c73 ("mtd: spi-nor: Fix clearing of QE bit on lock()/unlock()")
