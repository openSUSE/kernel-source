Subject: [PATCH] ARC: mm: Use max_high_pfn as a HIGHMEM zone border
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.5
Git-commit: 1d5e4640e5df15252398c1b621f6bd432f2d7f17

commit 1d5e4640e5df15252398c1b621f6bd432f2d7f17 upstream.

Commit 4af22ded0ecf ("arc: fix memory initialization for systems
with two memory banks") fixed highmem, but for the PAE case it causes
bug messages:

| BUG: Bad page state in process swapper  pfn:80000

This is because the fix expects highmem to be always less than
lowmem and uses min_low_pfn as an upper zone border for highmem.

max_high_pfn should be ok for both highmem and highmem+PAE cases.
