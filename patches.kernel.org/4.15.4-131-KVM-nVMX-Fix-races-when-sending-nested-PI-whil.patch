commit 6b6977117f50d60455ace86b2d256f6fb4f3de05 upstream.

Consider the following scenario:
1. CPU A calls vmx_deliver_nested_posted_interrupt() to send an IPI
to CPU B via virtual posted-interrupt mechanism.
2. CPU B is currently executing L2 guest.
3. vmx_deliver_nested_posted_interrupt() calls
kvm_vcpu_trigger_posted_interrupt() which will note that
vcpu->mode == IN_GUEST_MODE.
4. Assume that before CPU A sends the physical POSTED_INTR_NESTED_VECTOR
IPI, CPU B exits from L2 to L0 during event-delivery
(valid IDT-vectoring-info).
5. CPU A now sends the physical IPI. The IPI is received in host and
it's handler (smp_kvm_posted_intr_nested_ipi()) does nothing.
6. Assume that before CPU A sets pi_pending=true and KVM_REQ_EVENT,
CPU B continues to run in L0 and reach vcpu_enter_guest(). As
KVM_REQ_EVENT is not set yet, vcpu_enter_guest() will continue and resume
L2 guest.
7. At this point, CPU A sets pi_pending=true and KVM_REQ_EVENT but
it's too late! CPU B already entered L2 and KVM_REQ_EVENT will only be
consumed at next L2 entry!

Another scenario to consider:
1. CPU A calls vmx_deliver_nested_posted_interrupt() to send an IPI
to CPU B via virtual posted-interrupt mechanism.
2. Assume that before CPU A calls kvm_vcpu_trigger_posted_interrupt(),
CPU B is at L0 and is about to resume into L2. Further assume that it is
in vcpu_enter_guest() after check for KVM_REQ_EVENT.
3. At this point, CPU A calls kvm_vcpu_trigger_posted_interrupt() which
will note that vcpu->mode != IN_GUEST_MODE. Therefore, do nothing and
return false. Then, will set pi_pending=true and KVM_REQ_EVENT.
4. Now CPU B continue and resumes into L2 guest without processing
the posted-interrupt until next L2 entry!

To fix both issues, we just need to change
vmx_deliver_nested_posted_interrupt() to set pi_pending=true and
KVM_REQ_EVENT before calling kvm_vcpu_trigger_posted_interrupt().

It will fix the first scenario by chaging step (6) to note that
KVM_REQ_EVENT and pi_pending=true and therefore process
nested posted-interrupt.

It will fix the second scenario by two possible ways:
1. If kvm_vcpu_trigger_posted_interrupt() is called while CPU B has changed
vcpu->mode to IN_GUEST_MODE, physical IPI will be sent and will be received
when CPU resumes into L2.
2. If kvm_vcpu_trigger_posted_interrupt() is called while CPU B hasn't yet
changed vcpu->mode to IN_GUEST_MODE, then after CPU B will change
vcpu->mode it will call kvm_request_pending() which will return true and
therefore force another round of vcpu_enter_guest() which will note that
KVM_REQ_EVENT and pi_pending=true and therefore process nested
posted-interrupt.
