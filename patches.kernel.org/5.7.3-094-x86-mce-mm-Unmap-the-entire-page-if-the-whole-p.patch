Subject: [PATCH] x86/{mce,mm}: Unmap the entire page if the whole page is
 affected and poisoned
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.3
Git-commit: 17fae1294ad9d711b2c3dd0edef479d40c76a5e8

commit 17fae1294ad9d711b2c3dd0edef479d40c76a5e8 upstream.

An interesting thing happened when a guest Linux instance took a machine
check. The VMM unmapped the bad page from guest physical space and
passed the machine check to the guest.

Linux took all the normal actions to offline the page from the process
that was using it. But then guest Linux crashed because it said there
was a second machine check inside the kernel with this stack trace:

do_memory_failure
    set_mce_nospec
         set_memory_uc
              _set_memory_uc
                   change_page_attr_set_clr
                        cpa_flush
                             clflush_cache_range_opt

This was odd, because a CLFLUSH instruction shouldn't raise a machine
check (it isn't consuming the data). Further investigation showed that
the VMM had passed in another machine check because is appeared that the
guest was accessing the bad page.

Fix is to check the scope of the poison by checking the MCi_MISC register.
If the entire page is affected, then unmap the page. If only part of the
page is affected, then mark the page as uncacheable.

This assumes that VMMs will do the logical thing and pass in the "whole
page scope" via the MCi_MISC register (since they unmapped the entire
page).

  [ bp: Adjust to x86/entry changes. ]
