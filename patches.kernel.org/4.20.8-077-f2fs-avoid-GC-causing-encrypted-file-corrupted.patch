Subject: [PATCH] f2fs: avoid GC causing encrypted file corrupted
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.8
Git-commit: 9bf1a3f73927492c8be127b642197125e9d52be8

[ Upstream commit 9bf1a3f73927492c8be127b642197125e9d52be8 ]

The encrypted file may be corrupted by GC in following case:

Time 1: | segment 1 blkaddr = A |  GC -> | segment 2 blkaddr = B |
Encrypted block 1 is moved from blkaddr A of segment 1 to blkaddr B of
segment 2,

Time 2: | segment 1 blkaddr = B |  GC -> | segment 3 blkaddr = C |

Before page 1 is written back and if segment 2 become a victim, then
page 1 is moved from blkaddr B of segment 2 to blkaddr Cof segment 3,
during the GC process of Time 2, f2fs should wait for page 1 written back
before reading it, or move_data_block will read a garbage block from
blkaddr B since page is not written back to blkaddr B yet.

Commit 6aa58d8a ("f2fs: readahead encrypted block during GC") introduce
ra_data_block to read encrypted block, but it forgets to add
f2fs_wait_on_page_writeback to avoid racing between GC and flush.
