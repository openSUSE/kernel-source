Subject: [PATCH] ocfs2: fix cluster hang after a node dies
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.2
Git-commit: 1c01967116a678fed8e2c68a6ab82abc8effeddc

commit 1c01967116a678fed8e2c68a6ab82abc8effeddc upstream.

When a node dies, other live nodes have to choose a new master for an
existed lock resource mastered by the dead node.

As for ocfs2/dlm implementation, this is done by function -
dlm_move_lockres_to_recovery_list which marks those lock rsources as
DLM_LOCK_RES_RECOVERING and manages them via a list from which DLM
changes lock resource's master later.

So without invoking dlm_move_lockres_to_recovery_list, no master will be
choosed after dlm recovery accomplishment since no lock resource can be
found through ::resource list.

What's worse is that if DLM_LOCK_RES_RECOVERING is not marked for lock
resources mastered a dead node, it will break up synchronization among
nodes.

So invoke dlm_move_lockres_to_recovery_list again.

Fixs: 'commit ee8f7fcbe638 ("ocfs2/dlm: continue to purge recovery lockres when recovery master goes down")'
