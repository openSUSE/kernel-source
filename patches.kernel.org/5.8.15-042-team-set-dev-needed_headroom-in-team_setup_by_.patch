Subject: [PATCH] team: set dev->needed_headroom in team_setup_by_port()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.15
Git-commit: 89d01748b2354e210b5d4ea47bc25a42a1b42c82

commit 89d01748b2354e210b5d4ea47bc25a42a1b42c82 upstream.

Some devices set needed_headroom. If we ignore it, we might
end up crashing in various skb_push() for example in ipgre_header()
since some layers assume enough headroom has been reserved.
