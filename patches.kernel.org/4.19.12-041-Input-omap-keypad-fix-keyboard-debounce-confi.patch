Subject: [PATCH] Input: omap-keypad - fix keyboard debounce configuration
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.12
Git-commit: 6c3516fed7b61a3527459ccfa67fab130d910610

[ Upstream commit 6c3516fed7b61a3527459ccfa67fab130d910610 ]

I noticed that the Android v3.0.8 kernel on droid4 is using different
keypad values from the mainline kernel and does not have issues with
keys occasionally being stuck until pressed again. Turns out there was
an earlier patch posted to fix this as "Input: omap-keypad: errata i689:
Correct debounce time", but it was never reposted to fix use macros
for timing calculations.

This updated version is using macros, and also fixes the use of the
input clock rate to use 32768KiHz instead of 32000KiHz. And we want to
use the known good Android kernel values of 3 and 6 instead of 2 and 6
in the earlier patch.
