Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/powernv/cpufreq: Fix the frequency read by
 /proc/cpuinfo
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.8
Git-commit: cd77b5ce208c153260ed7882d8910f2395bfaabd

[ Upstream commit cd77b5ce208c153260ed7882d8910f2395bfaabd ]

The call to /proc/cpuinfo in turn calls cpufreq_quick_get() which
returns the last frequency requested by the kernel, but may not
reflect the actual frequency the processor is running at. This patch
makes a call to cpufreq_get() instead which returns the current
frequency reported by the hardware.
