Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: Register engines early to avoid type confusion
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.8
Git-commit: 6007265ad70a87aa9b4eea79b5e5828da452cfd8

[ Upstream commit 6007265ad70a87aa9b4eea79b5e5828da452cfd8 ]

Commit 1ec23ed7126e ("drm/i915: Use uabi engines for the default engine
map") switched from using for_each_engine() to for_each_uabi_engine() to
iterate over the user engines. While this seems to be a sensible change,
it's only safe to do when the engines are actually chained using the
rb-tree structure which is not the case during early driver
initialization where it can be either a lock-less list or regular
double-linked list.

In fact, the modesetting initialization code may end up calling
default_engines() through the fb helper code while the engines list
is still llist_node-based:

  i915_driver_probe() ->
    intel_display_driver_probe() ->
      intel_fbdev_init() ->
        drm_fb_helper_init() ->
          drm_client_init() ->
            drm_client_open() ->
              drm_file_alloc() ->
                i915_driver_open() ->
                  i915_gem_open() ->
                    i915_gem_context_open() ->
                      i915_gem_create_context() ->
                        default_engines()

Using for_each_uabi_engine() in default_engines() is therefore wrong, as
it would try to interpret the llist as rb-tree, making it find no engine
at all, as the rb_left and rb_right members will still be NULL, as they
haven't been initialized yet.

To fix this type confusion register the engines earlier and at the same
time reduce the amount of code that has to deal with the intermediate
llist state.
