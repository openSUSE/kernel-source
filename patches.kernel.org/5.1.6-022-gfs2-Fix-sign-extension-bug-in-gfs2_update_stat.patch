Subject: [PATCH] gfs2: Fix sign extension bug in gfs2_update_stats
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.6
Git-commit: 5a5ec83d6ac974b12085cd99b196795f14079037

commit 5a5ec83d6ac974b12085cd99b196795f14079037 upstream.

Commit 4d207133e9c3 changed the types of the statistic values in struct
gfs2_lkstats from s64 to u64.  Because of that, what should be a signed
value in gfs2_update_stats turned into an unsigned value.  When shifted
right, we end up with a large positive value instead of a small negative
value, which results in an incorrect variance estimate.

Fixes: 4d207133e9c3 ("gfs2: Make statistics unsigned, suitable for use with do_div()")
