Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: seq: Break too long mutex context in the write loop
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.3
Git-commit: ede34f397ddb063b145b9e7d79c6026f819ded13

commit ede34f397ddb063b145b9e7d79c6026f819ded13 upstream.

The fix for the racy writes and ioctls to sequencer widened the
application of client->ioctl_mutex to the whole write loop.  Although
it does unlock/relock for the lengthy operation like the event dup,
the loop keeps the ioctl_mutex for the whole time in other
situations.  This may take quite long time if the user-space would
give a huge buffer, and this is a likely cause of some weird behavior
spotted by syzcaller fuzzer.

This patch puts a simple workaround, just adding a mutex break in the
loop when a large number of events have been processed.  This
shouldn't hit any performance drop because the threshold is set high
enough for usual operations.

Fixes: 7bd800915677 ("ALSA: seq: More protection for concurrent write and ioctl races")
