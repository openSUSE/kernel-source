Subject: [PATCH] fuse: fix congested state leak on aborted connections
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.4
Git-commit: 8a301eb16d99983a4961f884690ec97b92e7dcfe

commit 8a301eb16d99983a4961f884690ec97b92e7dcfe upstream.

If a connection gets aborted while congested, FUSE can leave
nr_wb_congested[] stuck until reboot causing wait_iff_congested() to
wait spuriously which can lead to severe performance degradation.

The leak is caused by gating congestion state clearing with
fc->connected test in request_end().  This was added way back in 2009
by 26c3679101db ("fuse: destroy bdi on umount").  While the commit
description doesn't explain why the test was added, it most likely was
to avoid dereferencing bdi after it got destroyed.

Since then, bdi lifetime rules have changed many times and now we're
always guaranteed to have access to the bdi while the superblock is
alive (fc->sb).

Drop fc->connected conditional to avoid leaking congestion states.
