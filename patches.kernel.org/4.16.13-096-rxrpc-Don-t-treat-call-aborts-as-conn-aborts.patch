Subject: [PATCH] rxrpc: Don't treat call aborts as conn aborts
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.13
Git-commit: 57b0c9d49b94bbeb53649b7fbd264603c1ebd585

[ Upstream commit 57b0c9d49b94bbeb53649b7fbd264603c1ebd585 ]

If a call-level abort is received for the previous call to complete on a
connection channel, then that abort is queued for the connection processor
to handle.  Unfortunately, the connection processor then assumes without
checking that the abort is connection-level (ie. callNumber is 0) and
distributes it over all active calls on that connection, thereby
incorrectly aborting them.

Fix this by discarding aborts aimed at a completed call.

Further, discard all packets aimed at a call that's complete if there's
currently an active call on a channel, since the DATA packets associated
with the new call automatically terminate the old call.

Fixes: 18bfeba50dfd ("rxrpc: Perform terminal call ACK/ABORT retransmission from conn processor")
