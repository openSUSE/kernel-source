Subject: [PATCH] x86/fpu/xstate: Prevent false-positive warning in
 __copy_xstate_uabi_buf()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.22
Git-commit: b15888840207c2bfe678dd1f68a32db54315e71f

commit b15888840207c2bfe678dd1f68a32db54315e71f upstream.

__copy_xstate_to_uabi_buf() copies either from the tasks XSAVE buffer
or from init_fpstate into the ptrace buffer. Dynamic features, like
XTILEDATA, have an all zeroes init state and are not saved in
init_fpstate, which means the corresponding bit is not set in the
xfeatures bitmap of the init_fpstate header.

But __copy_xstate_to_uabi_buf() retrieves addresses for both the tasks
xstate and init_fpstate unconditionally via __raw_xsave_addr().

So if the tasks XSAVE buffer has a dynamic feature set, then the
address retrieval for init_fpstate triggers the warning in
__raw_xsave_addr() which checks the feature bit in the init_fpstate
header.

Remove the address retrieval from init_fpstate for extended features.
They have an all zeroes init state so init_fpstate has zeros for them.
Then zeroing the user buffer for the init state is the same as copying
them from init_fpstate.
