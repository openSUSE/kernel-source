Subject: [PATCH] io_uring: fix manual setup of iov_iter for fixed buffers
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.10
Git-commit: 99c79f6692ccdc42e04deea8a36e22bb48168a62

commit 99c79f6692ccdc42e04deea8a36e22bb48168a62 upstream.

Commit bd11b3a391e3 ("io_uring: don't use iov_iter_advance() for fixed
buffers") introduced an optimization to avoid using the slow
iov_iter_advance by manually populating the iov_iter iterator in some
cases.

However, the computation of the iterator count field was erroneous: The
first bvec was always accounted for an extent of page size even if the
bvec length was smaller.

In consequence, some I/O operations on fixed buffers were unable to
operate on the full extent of the buffer, consistently skipping some
bytes at the end of it.

Fixes: bd11b3a391e3 ("io_uring: don't use iov_iter_advance() for fixed buffers")
