Subject: [PATCH] KVM: Forbid the use of tagged userspace addresses for
 memslots
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.13
Git-commit: 139bc8a6146d92822c866cf2fd410159c56b3648

commit 139bc8a6146d92822c866cf2fd410159c56b3648 upstream.

The use of a tagged address could be pretty confusing for the
whole memslot infrastructure as well as the MMU notifiers.

Forbid it altogether, as it never quite worked the first place.

+On architectures that support a form of address tagging, userspace_addr must
+be an untagged address.

 It is recommended that the lower 21 bits of guest_phys_addr and userspace_addr
 be identical.  This allows large pages in the guest to be backed by large
 pages in the host.
