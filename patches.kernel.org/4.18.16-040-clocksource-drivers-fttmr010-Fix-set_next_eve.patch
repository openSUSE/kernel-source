Subject: [PATCH] clocksource/drivers/fttmr010: Fix set_next_event handler
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.16
Git-commit: 4451d3f59f2a6f95e5d205c2d04ea072955d080d

[ Upstream commit 4451d3f59f2a6f95e5d205c2d04ea072955d080d ]

Currently, the aspeed MATCH1 register is updated to <current_count -
cycles> in set_next_event handler, with the assumption that COUNT
register value is preserved when the timer is disabled and it continues
decrementing after the timer is enabled. But the assumption is wrong:
RELOAD register is loaded into COUNT register when the aspeed timer is
enabled, which means the next event may be delayed because timer
interrupt won't be generated until <0xFFFFFFFF - current_count +
cycles>.

The problem can be fixed by updating RELOAD register to <cycles>, and
COUNT register will be re-loaded when the timer is enabled and interrupt
is generated when COUNT register overflows.

The test result on Facebook Backpack-CMM BMC hardware (AST2500) shows
the issue is fixed: without the patch, usleep(100) suspends the process
for several milliseconds (and sometimes even over 40 milliseconds);
after applying the fix, usleep(100) takes averagely 240 microseconds to
return under the same workload level.
