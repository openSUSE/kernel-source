Subject: [PATCH] power: supply: cpcap-battery: Check voltage before
 orderly_poweroff
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.7
Git-commit: 639c1524da3b273d20c42ff2387d08eb4b12e903

[ Upstream commit 639c1524da3b273d20c42ff2387d08eb4b12e903 ]

We can get the low voltage interrupt trigger sometimes way too early,
maybe because of CPU load spikes. This causes orderly_poweroff() be
called too easily.

Let's check the voltage before orderly_poweroff in case it was not
yet a permanent condition. We will be getting more interrupts anyways
if the condition persists.

Let's also show the measured voltages for low battery and battery
empty warnings since we have them.
