Subject: [PATCH] clk: fix false-positive Wmaybe-uninitialized warning
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.4
Git-commit: ce33f284935e08229046b30635e6aadcbab02b53

commit ce33f284935e08229046b30635e6aadcbab02b53 upstream.

When we build this driver with on x86-32, gcc produces a false-positive warning:

drivers/clk/renesas/clk-sh73a0.c: In function 'sh73a0_cpg_clocks_init':
drivers/clk/renesas/clk-sh73a0.c:155:10: error: 'parent_name' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
   return clk_register_fixed_factor(NULL, name, parent_name, 0,

We can work around that warning by adding a fake initialization, I tried
and failed to come up with any better workaround. This is currently one
of few remaining warnings for a 4.14.y randconfig build, so it would be
good to also have it backported at least to that version. Older versions
have more randconfig warnings, so we might not care.

I had not noticed this earlier, because one patch in my randconfig test
tree removes the '-ffreestanding' option on x86-32, and that avoids
the warning. The -ffreestanding flag was originally global but moved
into arch/i386 by Andi Kleen in commit 6edfba1b33c7 ("[PATCH] x86_64:
Don't define string functions to builtin") as a 'temporary workaround'.

Like many temporary hacks, this turned out to be rather long-lived, from
all I can tell we still need a simple fix to asm/string_32.h before it
can be removed, but I'm not sure about how to best do that.
