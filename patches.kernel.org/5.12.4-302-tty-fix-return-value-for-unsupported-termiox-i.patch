Subject: [PATCH] tty: fix return value for unsupported termiox ioctls
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.4
Git-commit: 8871de06ff78e9333d86c87d7071452b690e7c9b

[ Upstream commit 8871de06ff78e9333d86c87d7071452b690e7c9b ]

Drivers should return -ENOTTY ("Inappropriate I/O control operation")
when an ioctl isn't supported, while -EINVAL is used for invalid
arguments.

Support for termiox was added by commit 1d65b4a088de ("tty: Add
termiox") in 2008 but no driver support ever followed and it was
recently ripped out by commit e0efb3168d34 ("tty: Remove dead termiox
code").

Fix the return value for the unsupported termiox ioctls, which have
always returned -EINVAL, by explicitly returning -ENOTTY rather than
removing them completely and falling back to the default unrecognised-
ioctl handling.

Fixes: 1d65b4a088de ("tty: Add termiox")
