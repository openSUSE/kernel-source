Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: marvell: keep SMMU disabled by default for Armada
 7040 and 8040
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.4
Git-commit: f43cadef2df260101497a6aace05e24201f00202

commit f43cadef2df260101497a6aace05e24201f00202 upstream.

FW has to configure devices' StreamIDs so that SMMU is able to lookup
context and do proper translation later on. For Armada 7040 & 8040 and
publicly available FW, most of the devices are configured properly,
but some like ap_sdhci0, PCIe, NIC still remain unassigned which
results in SMMU faults about unmatched StreamID (assuming
ARM_SMMU_DISABLE_BYPASS_BY_DEFAUL=y).

Since there is dependency on custom FW let SMMU be disabled by default.
People who still willing to use SMMU need to enable manually and
use ARM_SMMU_DISABLE_BYPASS_BY_DEFAUL=n (or via kernel command line)
with extra caution.
