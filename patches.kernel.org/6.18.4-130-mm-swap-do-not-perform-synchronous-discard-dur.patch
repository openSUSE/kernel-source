Subject: [PATCH] mm, swap: do not perform synchronous discard during
 allocation
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.4
Git-commit: 9fb749cd15078c7bdc46e5d45c37493f83323e33

commit 9fb749cd15078c7bdc46e5d45c37493f83323e33 upstream.

Patch series "mm, swap: misc cleanup and bugfix", v2.

A few cleanups and a bugfix that are either suitable after the swap table
phase I or found during code review.

Patch 1 is a bugfix and needs to be included in the stable branch, the
rest have no behavioral change.


This patch (of 5):

Since commit 1b7e90020eb77 ("mm, swap: use percpu cluster as allocation
fast path"), swap allocation is protected by a local lock, which means we
can't do any sleeping calls during allocation.

However, the discard routine is not taken well care of.  When the swap
allocator failed to find any usable cluster, it would look at the pending
discard cluster and try to issue some blocking discards.  It may not
necessarily sleep, but the cond_resched at the bio layer indicates this is
wrong when combined with a local lock.  And the bio GFP flag used for
discard bio is also wrong (not atomic).

It's arguable whether this synchronous discard is helpful at all.  In most
cases, the async discard is good enough.  And the swap allocator is doing
very differently at organizing the clusters since the recent change, so it
is very rare to see discard clusters piling up.

So far, no issues have been observed or reported with typical SSD setups
under months of high pressure.  This issue was found during my code
review.  But by hacking the kernel a bit: adding a mdelay(500) in the
async discard path, this issue will be observable with WARNING triggered
by the wrong GFP and cond_resched in the bio layer for debug builds.

So now let's apply a hotfix for this issue: remove the synchronous discard
in the swap allocation path.  And when order 0 is failing with all cluster
list drained on all swap devices, try to do a discard following the swap
device priority list.  If any discards released some cluster, try the
allocation again.  This way, we can still avoid OOM due to swap failure if
the hardware is very slow and memory pressure is extremely high.

This may cause more fragmentation issues if the discarding hardware is
really slow.  Ideally, we want to discard pending clusters before
continuing to iterate the fragment cluster lists.  This can be implemented
in a cleaner way if we clean up the device list iteration part first.
