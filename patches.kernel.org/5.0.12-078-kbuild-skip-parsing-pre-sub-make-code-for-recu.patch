Subject: [PATCH] kbuild: skip parsing pre sub-make code for recursion
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.12
Git-commit: 221cc2d27ddc49b3e06d4637db02bf78e70c573c

[ Upstream commit 221cc2d27ddc49b3e06d4637db02bf78e70c573c ]

When Make recurses to the top Makefile with sub-make-done unset,
the code block surrounded by 'ifneq ($(sub-make-done),1) ... endif'
is parsed multiple times. This happens for in-tree building of
include/config/auto.conf, *-pkg, etc. with GNU Make 4.x.

This is a slight regression by commit 688931a5ad4e ("kbuild: skip
sub-make for in-tree build with GNU Make 4.x") in terms of performance
since that code block contains one $(shell ...) invocation.

Fix it by exporting the variable irrespective of sub-make being run.
I renamed it because GNU Make cannot properly export variables
containing hyphens. This is probably a bug of GNU Make, and the issue
in Kbuild had already been reported by commit 2bfbe7881ee0 ("kbuild:
Do not use hyphen in exported variable name").
