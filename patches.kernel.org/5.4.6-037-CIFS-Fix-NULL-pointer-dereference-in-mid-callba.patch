Subject: [PATCH] CIFS: Fix NULL pointer dereference in mid callback
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.6
Git-commit: 86a7964be7afaf3df6b64faaa10a7032d2444e51

commit 86a7964be7afaf3df6b64faaa10a7032d2444e51 upstream.

There is a race between a system call processing thread
and the demultiplex thread when mid->resp_buf becomes NULL
and later is being accessed to get credits. It happens when
the 1st thread wakes up before a mid callback is called in
the 2nd one but the mid state has already been set to
MID_RESPONSE_RECEIVED. This causes NULL pointer dereference
in mid callback.

Fix this by saving credits from the response before we
update the mid state and then use this value in the mid
callback rather then accessing a response buffer.
