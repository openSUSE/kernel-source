Subject: [PATCH] platform/x86: intel_scu_ipc: Check status upon timeout in
 ipc_wait_for_interrupt()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.56
Git-commit: 427fada620733e6474d783ae6037a66eae42bf8c

[ Upstream commit 427fada620733e6474d783ae6037a66eae42bf8c ]

It's possible for the completion in ipc_wait_for_interrupt() to timeout,
simply because the interrupt was delayed in being processed. A timeout
in itself is not an error. This driver should check the status register
upon a timeout to ensure that scheduling or interrupt processing delays
don't affect the outcome of the IPC return value.

 ipc_wait_for_interrupt()
  wait_for_completion_timeout(&scu->cmd_complete)
  [TIMEOUT]                                             status[IPC_STATUS_BUSY]=0

Fix this problem by reading the status bit in all cases, regardless of
the timeout. If the completion times out, we'll assume the problem was
that the IPC_STATUS_BUSY bit was still set, but if the status bit is
cleared in the meantime we know that we hit some scheduling delay and we
should just check the error bit.
