Subject: [PATCH] proc: Check /proc/$pid/attr/ writes against file opener
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.9
Git-commit: bfb819ea20ce8bbeeba17e1a6418bf8bda91fc28

commit bfb819ea20ce8bbeeba17e1a6418bf8bda91fc28 upstream.

Fix another "confused deputy" weakness[1]. Writes to /proc/$pid/attr/
files need to check the opener credentials, since these fds do not
transition state across execve(). Without this, it is possible to
trick another process (which may have different credentials) to write
to its own /proc/$pid/attr/ files, leading to unexpected and possibly
exploitable behaviors.
