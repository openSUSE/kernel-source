Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: Apply runtime updates to current CPUID during
 KVM_SET_CPUID{,2}
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.3
Git-commit: e2b43fb25243d502ad36b07bab9de09f4b76fff9

commit e2b43fb25243d502ad36b07bab9de09f4b76fff9 upstream.

When handling KVM_SET_CPUID{,2}, do runtime CPUID updates on the vCPU's
current CPUID (and caps) prior to swapping in the incoming CPUID state so
that KVM doesn't lose pending updates if the incoming CPUID is rejected,
and to prevent a false failure on the equality check.

Note, runtime updates are unconditionally performed on the incoming/new
CPUID (and associated caps), i.e. clearing the dirty flag won't negatively
affect the new CPUID.

Fixes: 93da6af3ae56 ("KVM: x86: Defer runtime updates of dynamic CPUID bits until CPUID emulation")
