[ Upstream commit 2de42f79bb21a412f40ade8831eb6fc445cb78a4 ]

Consider the following scenario:
1. nonblocking enable crtc
2. wait for the event
3. nonblocking disable crtc

On i915 this can lead to a spurious -EBUSY from step 3 on
account of non-enabled planes getting the fake_commit in step 1
and we don't complete the fake_commit-> flip_done until
drm_atomic_helper_commit_hw_done() which can happen a long
time after the flip event was sent out.

This will become somewhat easy to hit on SKL+ once we start
to add all the planes for the crtc to every modeset commit
for the purposes of forcing a watermark register programming
[1].

To make the race a little less pronounced let's complete
fake_commit->flip_done after drm_atomic_helper_wait_for_flip_done().
For the single crtc case this should make the race quite
theoretical, assuming drm_atomic_helper_wait_for_flip_done()
actually has to wait for the real commit flip_done. In case
the real commit flip_done gets completed singificantly before
drm_atomic_helper_wait_for_flip_done(), or we are dealing with
multiple crtcs whose vblanks don't line up nicely the race still
exists.
