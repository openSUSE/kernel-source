Subject: [PATCH] block: use 32-bit blk_status_t on Alpha
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.4
Git-commit: 6e2fb22103b99c26ae30a46512abe75526d8e4c9

commit 6e2fb22103b99c26ae30a46512abe75526d8e4c9 upstream.

Early alpha processors cannot write a single byte or word; they read 8
bytes, modify the value in registers and write back 8 bytes.

The type blk_status_t is defined as one byte, it is often written
asynchronously by I/O completion routines, this asynchronous modification
can corrupt content of nearby bytes if these nearby bytes can be written
simultaneously by another CPU.

- one example of such corruption is the structure dm_io where
  "blk_status_t status" is written by an asynchronous completion routine
  and "atomic_t io_count" is modified synchronously
- another example is the structure dm_buffer where "unsigned hold_count"
  is modified synchronously from process context and "blk_status_t
  write_error" is modified asynchronously from bio completion routine

This patch fixes the bug by changing the type blk_status_t to 32 bits if
we are on Alpha and if we are compiling for a processor that doesn't have
the byte-word-extension.
