Subject: [PATCH] pinctrl: avoid reload of p state in list iteration
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.5
Git-commit: 4198a9b571065978632276264e01d71d68000ac5

commit 4198a9b571065978632276264e01d71d68000ac5 upstream.

When in the list_for_each_entry iteration, reload of p->state->settings
with a local setting from old_state will turn the list iteration into an
infinite loop.

The typical symptom when the issue happens, will be a printk message like:

  "not freeing pin xx (xxx) as part of deactivating group xxx - it is
already used for some other setting".

This is a compiler-dependent problem, one instance occurred using Clang
version 10.0 on the arm64 architecture with linux version 4.19.
