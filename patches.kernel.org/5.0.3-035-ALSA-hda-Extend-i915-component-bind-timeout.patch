Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda: Extend i915 component bind timeout
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.3
Git-commit: cfc35f9c128cea8fce6a5513b1de50d36f3b209f

commit cfc35f9c128cea8fce6a5513b1de50d36f3b209f upstream.

I set 10 seconds for the timeout of the i915 audio component binding
with a hope that recent machines are fast enough to handle all probe
tasks in that period, but I was too optimistic.  The binding may take
longer than that, and this caused a problem on the machine with both
audio and graphics driver modules loaded in parallel, as Paul Menzel
experienced.  This problem haven't hit so often just because the KMS
driver is loaded in initrd on most machines.

As a simple workaround, extend the timeout to 60 seconds.
