Subject: [PATCH] net: stmmac: Fix unset max_speed difference between DT and
 non-DT platforms
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.3
Git-commit: c21cabb0fd0b54b8b54235fc1ecfe1195a23bcb2

[ Upstream commit c21cabb0fd0b54b8b54235fc1ecfe1195a23bcb2 ]

In commit 9cbadf094d9d ("net: stmmac: support max-speed device tree
property"), when DT platforms don't set "max-speed", max_speed is set to
-1; for non-DT platforms, it stays the default 0.

Prior to commit eeef2f6b9f6e ("net: stmmac: Start adding phylink support"),
the check for a valid max_speed setting was to check if it was greater
than zero. This commit got it right, but subsequent patches just checked
for non-zero, which is incorrect for DT platforms.

In commit 92c3807b9ac3 ("net: stmmac: convert to phylink_get_linkmodes()")
the conversion switched completely to checking for non-zero value as a
valid value, which caused 1000base-T to stop getting advertised by
default.

Instead of trying to fix all the checks, simply leave max_speed alone if
DT property parsing fails.

Fixes: 9cbadf094d9d ("net: stmmac: support max-speed device tree property")
Fixes: 92c3807b9ac3 ("net: stmmac: convert to phylink_get_linkmodes()")
