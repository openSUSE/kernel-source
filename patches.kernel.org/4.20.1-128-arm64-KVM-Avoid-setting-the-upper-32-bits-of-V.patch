Subject: [PATCH] arm64: KVM: Avoid setting the upper 32 bits of VTCR_EL2 to 1
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.1
Git-commit: df655b75c43fba0f2621680ab261083297fd6d16

commit df655b75c43fba0f2621680ab261083297fd6d16 upstream.

Although bit 31 of VTCR_EL2 is RES1, we inadvertently end up setting all
of the upper 32 bits to 1 as well because we define VTCR_EL2_RES1 as
signed, which is sign-extended when assigning to kvm->arch.vtcr.

Lucky for us, the architecture currently treats these upper bits as RES0
so, whilst we've been naughty, we haven't set fire to anything yet.
