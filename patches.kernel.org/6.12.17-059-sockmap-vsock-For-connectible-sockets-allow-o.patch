Subject: [PATCH] sockmap, vsock: For connectible sockets allow only connected
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.17
Git-commit: 8fb5bb169d17cdd12c2dcc2e96830ed487d77a0f

[ Upstream commit 8fb5bb169d17cdd12c2dcc2e96830ed487d77a0f ]

sockmap expects all vsocks to have a transport assigned, which is expressed
in vsock_proto::psock_update_sk_prot(). However, there is an edge case
where an unconnected (connectible) socket may lose its previously assigned
transport. This is handled with a NULL check in the vsock/BPF recv path.

Another design detail is that listening vsocks are not supposed to have any
transport assigned at all. Which implies they are not supported by the
sockmap. But this is complicated by the fact that a socket, before
switching to TCP_LISTEN, may have had some transport assigned during a
failed connect() attempt. Hence, we may end up with a listening vsock in a
sockmap, which blows up quickly:

For connectible sockets, instead of relying solely on the state of
vsk->transport, tell sockmap to only allow those representing established
connections. This aligns with the behaviour for AF_INET and AF_UNIX.
