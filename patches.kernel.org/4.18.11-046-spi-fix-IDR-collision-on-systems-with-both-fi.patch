Subject: [PATCH] spi: fix IDR collision on systems with both fixed and dynamic
 SPI bus numbers
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.11
Git-commit: 1a4327fbf4554d5b78d75b19a13d40d6de220159

commit 1a4327fbf4554d5b78d75b19a13d40d6de220159 upstream.

On systems where some controllers get a dynamic ID assigned and some have
a fixed number (e.g. from ACPI tables), the current implementation might
run into an IDR collision: in case of a fixed bus number is gotten by a
driver (but not marked busy in IDR tree) and a driver with dynamic bus
number gets the same ID and predictably fails.

Fix this by means of checking-in fixed IDsin IDR as far as dynamic ones
at the moment of the controller registration.

Fixes: 9b61e302210e (spi: Pick spi bus number from Linux idr or spi alias)
