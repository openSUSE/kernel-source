Subject: [PATCH] NFS: Only change the cookie verifier if the directory page
 cache is empty
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.5
Git-commit: f892c41c14e0fa3d78ce37de1d5c8161ed13bf08

[ Upstream commit f892c41c14e0fa3d78ce37de1d5c8161ed13bf08 ]

The cached NFSv3/v4 readdir cookies are associated with a verifier,
which is checked by the server on subsequent calls to readdir, and is
only expected to change when the cookies (and hence also the page cache
contents) are considered invalid.
We therefore do have to store the verifier, but only when the page cache
is empty.
