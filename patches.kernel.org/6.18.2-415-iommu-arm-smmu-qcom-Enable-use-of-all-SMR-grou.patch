Subject: [PATCH] iommu/arm-smmu-qcom: Enable use of all SMR groups when
 running bare-metal
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.2
Git-commit: 5583a55e074b33ccd88ac0542fd7cd656a7e2c8c

[ Upstream commit 5583a55e074b33ccd88ac0542fd7cd656a7e2c8c ]

Some platforms (e.g. SC8280XP and X1E) support more than 128 stream
matching groups. This is more than what is defined as maximum by the ARM
SMMU architecture specification. Commit 122611347326 ("iommu/arm-smmu-qcom:
Limit the SMR groups to 128") disabled use of the additional groups because
they don't exhibit the same behavior as the architecture supported ones.

It seems like this is just another quirk of the hypervisor: When running
bare-metal without the hypervisor, the additional groups appear to behave
just like all others. The boot firmware uses some of the additional groups,
so ignoring them in this situation leads to stream match conflicts whenever
we allocate a new SMR group for the same SID.

The workaround exists primarily because the bypass quirk detection fails
when using a S2CR register from the additional matching groups, so let's
perform the test with the last reliable S2CR (127) and then limit the
number of SMR groups only if we detect that we are running below the
hypervisor (because of the bypass quirk).
