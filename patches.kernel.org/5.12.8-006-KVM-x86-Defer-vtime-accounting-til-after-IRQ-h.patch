Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: Defer vtime accounting 'til after IRQ handling
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.8
Git-commit: 160457140187c5fb127b844e5a85f87f00a01b14

commit 160457140187c5fb127b844e5a85f87f00a01b14 upstream.

Defer the call to account guest time until after servicing any IRQ(s)
that happened in the guest or immediately after VM-Exit.  Tick-based
accounting of vCPU time relies on PF_VCPU being set when the tick IRQ
handler runs, and IRQs are blocked throughout the main sequence of
vcpu_enter_guest(), including the call into vendor code to actually
enter and exit the guest.

This fixes a bug where reported guest time remains '0', even when
running an infinite loop in the guest:
