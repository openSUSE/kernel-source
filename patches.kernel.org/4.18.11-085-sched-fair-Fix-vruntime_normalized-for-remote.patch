Subject: [PATCH] sched/fair: Fix vruntime_normalized() for remote
 non-migration wakeup
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.11
Git-commit: d0cdb3ce8834332d918fc9c8ff74f8a169ec9abe

commit d0cdb3ce8834332d918fc9c8ff74f8a169ec9abe upstream.

When a task which previously ran on a given CPU is remotely queued to
wake up on that same CPU, there is a period where the task's state is
TASK_WAKING and its vruntime is not normalized. This is not accounted
for in vruntime_normalized() which will cause an error in the task's
vruntime if it is switched from the fair class during this time.

For example if it is boosted to RT priority via rt_mutex_setprio(),
rq->min_vruntime will not be subtracted from the task's vruntime but
it will be added again when the task returns to the fair class. The
task's vruntime will have been erroneously doubled and the effective
priority of the task will be reduced.

Note this will also lead to inflation of all vruntimes since the doubled
vruntime value will become the rq's min_vruntime when other tasks leave
the rq. This leads to repeated doubling of the vruntime and priority
penalty.

Fix this by recognizing a WAKING task's vruntime as normalized only if
sched_remote_wakeup is true. This indicates a migration, in which case
the vruntime would have been normalized in migrate_task_rq_fair().

Based on a similar patch from John Dias <joaodias@google.com>.
