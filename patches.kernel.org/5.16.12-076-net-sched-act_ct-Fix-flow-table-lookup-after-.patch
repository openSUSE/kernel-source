Subject: [PATCH] net/sched: act_ct: Fix flow table lookup after ct clear or
 switching zones
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.16.12
Git-commit: 2f131de361f6d0eaff17db26efdb844c178432f8

commit 2f131de361f6d0eaff17db26efdb844c178432f8 upstream.

Flow table lookup is skipped if packet either went through ct clear
action (which set the IP_CT_UNTRACKED flag on the packet), or while
switching zones and there is already a connection associated with
the packet. This will result in no SW offload of the connection,
and the and connection not being removed from flow table with
TCP teardown (fin/rst packet).

To fix the above, remove these unneccary checks in flow
table lookup.
