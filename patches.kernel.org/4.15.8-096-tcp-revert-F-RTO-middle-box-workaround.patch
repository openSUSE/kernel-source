Subject: [PATCH] tcp: revert F-RTO middle-box workaround
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.8
Git-commit: d4131f09770d9b7471c9da65e6ecd2477746ac5c

[ Upstream commit d4131f09770d9b7471c9da65e6ecd2477746ac5c ]

This reverts commit cc663f4d4c97b7297fb45135ab23cfd508b35a77. While fixing
some broken middle-boxes that modifies receive window fields, it does not
address middle-boxes that strip off SACK options. The best solution is
to fully revert this patch and the root F-RTO enhancement.

Fixes: cc663f4d4c97 ("tcp: restrict F-RTO to work-around broken middle-boxes")
