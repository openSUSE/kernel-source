Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: keystone-k2e-clocks: Fix missing unit address
 separator
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.13

[ Upstream commit 5a3a03905a433216f517babd0a343ae7265e9ca1 ]

Commit 95d8b41c765b ("ARM: dts: keystone-k2e-clocks: Add missing unit
name to clock nodes that have regs") fixed the unit names on various
clock nodes but missed out adding the unit address separator on the
clkhyperlink0 clock node. Fix the same.
