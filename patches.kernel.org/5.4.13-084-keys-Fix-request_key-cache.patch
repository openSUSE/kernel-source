Subject: [PATCH] keys: Fix request_key() cache
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.13
Git-commit: 8379bb84be757d5df2d818509faec5d66adb861d

commit 8379bb84be757d5df2d818509faec5d66adb861d upstream.

When the key cached by request_key() and co.  is cleaned up on exit(),
the code looks in the wrong task_struct, and so clears the wrong cache.
This leads to anomalies in key refcounting when doing, say, a kernel
build on an afs volume, that then trigger kasan to report a
use-after-free when the key is viewed in /proc/keys.

Fix this by making exit_creds() look in the passed-in task_struct rather
than in current (the task_struct cleanup code is deferred by RCU and
potentially run in another task).

Fixes: 7743c48e54ee ("keys: Cache result of request_key*() temporarily in task_struct")
