Subject: [PATCH] mmc: sdhci-xenon: add timeout for PHY init complete
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.21
Git-commit: 09e23823ae9a3e2d5d20f2e1efe0d6e48cef9129

commit 09e23823ae9a3e2d5d20f2e1efe0d6e48cef9129 upstream.

AC5X spec says PHY init complete bit must be polled until zero.
We see cases in which timeout can take longer than the standard
calculation on AC5X, which is expected following the spec comment above.
According to the spec, we must wait as long as it takes for that bit to
toggle on AC5X.
Cap that with 100 delay loops so we won't get stuck forever.
