Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm64: Write arch.mdcr_el2 changes since last vcpu_load
 on VHE
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.1
Git-commit: 4942dc6638b07b5326b6d2faa142635c559e7cd5

commit 4942dc6638b07b5326b6d2faa142635c559e7cd5 upstream.

On VHE systems arch.mdcr_el2 is written to mdcr_el2 at vcpu_load time to
set options for self-hosted debug and the performance monitors
extension.

Unfortunately the value of arch.mdcr_el2 is not calculated until
kvm_arm_setup_debug() in the run loop after the vcpu has been loaded.
This means that the initial brief iterations of the run loop use a zero
value of mdcr_el2 - until the vcpu is preempted. This also results in a
delay between changes to vcpu->guest_debug taking effect.

Fix this by writing to mdcr_el2 in kvm_arm_setup_debug() on VHE systems
when a change to arch.mdcr_el2 has been detected.
