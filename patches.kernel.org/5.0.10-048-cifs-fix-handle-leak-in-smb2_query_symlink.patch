Subject: [PATCH] cifs: fix handle leak in smb2_query_symlink()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.10
Git-commit: e6d0fb7b34f264f72c33053558a360a6a734905e

commit e6d0fb7b34f264f72c33053558a360a6a734905e upstream.

If we enter smb2_query_symlink() for something that is not a symlink
and where the SMB2_open() would succeed we would never end up
closing this handle and would thus leak a handle on the server.

Fix this by immediately calling SMB2_close() on successfull open.
