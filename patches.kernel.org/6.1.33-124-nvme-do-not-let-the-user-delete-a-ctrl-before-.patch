Subject: [PATCH] nvme: do not let the user delete a ctrl before a complete
 initialization
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.33
Git-commit: 2eb94dd56a4a4e3fe286def3e2ba207804a37345

[ Upstream commit 2eb94dd56a4a4e3fe286def3e2ba207804a37345 ]

If a userspace application performes a "delete_controller" command
early during the ctrl initialization, the delete operation
may race against the init code and the kernel will crash.

nvme nvme5: Connect command failed: host path error
nvme nvme5: failed to connect queue: 0 ret=880
PF: supervisor write access in kernel mode
PF: error_code(0x0002) - not-present page

 nvme_do_delete_ctrl+0x7f/0x8b [nvme_core]

 kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x124/0x1b0
 new_sync_write+0xff/0x190
 vfs_write+0x1ef/0x280

Fix the crash by checking the NVME_CTRL_STARTED_ONCE bit;
if it's not set it means that the nvme controller is still
in the process of getting initialized and the kernel
will return an -EBUSY error to userspace.
Set the NVME_CTRL_STARTED_ONCE later in the nvme_start_ctrl()
function, after the controller start operation is completed.
