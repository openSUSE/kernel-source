Subject: [PATCH] sysctl: clarify register_sysctl_init() base directory order
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.29
Git-commit: 228b09de936395ddd740df3522ea35ae934830d8

commit 228b09de936395ddd740df3522ea35ae934830d8 upstream.

Relatively new docs which I added which hinted the base directories needed
to be created before is wrong, remove that incorrect comment. This has been
hinted before by Eric twice already [0] [1], I had just not verified that
until now. Now that I've verified that updates the docs to relax the context
described.
