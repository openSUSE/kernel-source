Subject: [PATCH] KVM: SVM: Manually context switch DEBUGCTL if LBR
 virtualization is disabled
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.19
Git-commit: 433265870ab3455b418885bff48fa5fd02f7e448

commit 433265870ab3455b418885bff48fa5fd02f7e448 upstream.

Manually load the guest's DEBUGCTL prior to VMRUN (and restore the host's
value on #VMEXIT) if it diverges from the host's value and LBR
virtualization is disabled, as hardware only context switches DEBUGCTL if
LBR virtualization is fully enabled.  Running the guest with the host's
value has likely been mildly problematic for quite some time, e.g. it will
result in undesirable behavior if BTF diverges (with the caveat that KVM
now suppresses guest BTF due to lack of support).

But the bug became fatal with the introduction of Bus Lock Trap ("Detect"
in kernel paralance) support for AMD (commit 408eb7417a92
("x86/bus_lock: Add support for AMD")), as a bus lock in the guest will
trigger an unexpected #DB.

Note, suppressing the bus lock #DB, i.e. simply resuming the guest without
injecting a #DB, is not an option.  It wouldn't address the general issue
with DEBUGCTL, e.g. for things like BTF, and there are other guest-visible
side effects if BusLockTrap is left enabled.

If BusLockTrap is disabled, then DR6.BLD is reserved-to-1; any attempts to
clear it by software are ignored.  But if BusLockTrap is enabled, software
can clear DR6.BLD:

  Software enables bus lock trap by setting DebugCtl MSR[BLCKDB] (bit 2)
  to 1.  When bus lock trap is enabled, ... The processor indicates that
  this #DB was caused by a bus lock by clearing DR6[BLD] (bit 11).  DR6[11]
  previously had been defined to be always 1.

and clearing DR6.BLD is "sticky" in that it's not set (i.e. lowered) by
other #DBs:

  All other #DB exceptions leave DR6[BLD] unmodified

E.g. leaving BusLockTrap enable can confuse a legacy guest that writes '0'
to reset DR6.
