commit 64531a3b70b17c8d3e77f2e49e5e1bb70f571266 upstream.

Commit 147277540bbc ("kvm: svm: Add support for additional SVM NPF error
codes", 2016-11-23) added a new error code to aid nested page fault
handling.  The commit unprotects (kvm_mmu_unprotect_page) the page when
we get a NPF due to guest page table walk where the page was marked RO.

However, if an L0->L2 shadow nested page table can also be marked read-only
when a page is read only in L1's nested page table.  If such a page
is accessed by L2 while walking page tables it can cause a nested
page fault (page table walks are write accesses).  However, after
kvm_mmu_unprotect_page we may get another page fault, and again in an
endless stream.

To cover this use case, we qualify the new error_code check with
vcpu->arch.mmu_direct_map so that the error_code check would run on L1
guest, and not the L2 guest.  This avoids hitting the above scenario.
