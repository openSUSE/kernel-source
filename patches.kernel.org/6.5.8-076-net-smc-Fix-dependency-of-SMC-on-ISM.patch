Subject: [PATCH] net/smc: Fix dependency of SMC on ISM
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.8
Git-commit: a72178cfe855c283224f393d94a1332b90d1483e

[ Upstream commit a72178cfe855c283224f393d94a1332b90d1483e ]

When the SMC protocol is built into the kernel proper while ISM is
configured to be built as module, linking the kernel fails due to
unresolved dependencies out of net/smc/smc_ism.o to
ism_get_smcd_ops, ism_register_client, and ism_unregister_client
as reported via the linux-next test automation (see link).
This however is a bug introduced a while ago.

Correct the dependency list in ISM's and SMC's Kconfig to reflect the
dependencies that are actually inverted. With this you cannot build a
kernel with CONFIG_SMC=y and CONFIG_ISM=m. Either ISM needs to be 'y',
too - or a 'n'. That way, SMC can still be configured on non-s390
architectures that do not have (nor need) an ISM driver.
