Subject: [PATCH] selftests: settings: tests can be in subsubdirs
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.6
Git-commit: ac87813d4372f4c005264acbe3b7f00c1dee37c4

[ Upstream commit ac87813d4372f4c005264acbe3b7f00c1dee37c4 ]

Commit 852c8cbf34d3 ("selftests/kselftest/runner.sh: Add 45 second
timeout per test") adds support for a new per-test-directory "settings"
file. But this only works for tests not in a sub-subdirectories, e.g.

 - tools/testing/selftests/rtc (rtc) is OK,
 - tools/testing/selftests/net/mptcp (net/mptcp) is not.

We have to increase the timeout for net/mptcp tests which are not
upstreamed yet but this fix is valid for other tests if they need to add
a "settings" file, see the full list with:

  tools/testing/selftests/*/*/**/Makefile

Note that this patch changes the text header message printed at the end
of the execution but this text is modified only for the tests that are
in sub-subdirectories, e.g.

  ok 1 selftests: net/mptcp: mptcp_connect.sh

Before we had:

  ok 1 selftests: mptcp: mptcp_connect.sh

But showing the full target name is probably better, just in case a
subsubdir has the same name as another one in another subdirectory.
