Subject: [PATCH] rxrpc: Fix resend event time calculation
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.13
Git-commit: 59299aa1028fce051adbd25aaff7c387b865cd6d

[ Upstream commit 59299aa1028fce051adbd25aaff7c387b865cd6d ]

Commit a158bdd3 ("rxrpc: Fix call timeouts") reworked the time calculation
for the next resend event.  For this calculation, "oldest" will be before
"now", so ktime_sub(oldest, now) will yield a negative value.  When passed
to nsecs_to_jiffies which expects an unsigned value, the end result will be
a very large value, and a resend event scheduled far into the future.  This
could cause calls to stall if some packets were lost.

Fix by ordering the arguments to ktime_sub correctly.
