Subject: [PATCH] mm/vmalloc: Fix unlock order in s_stop()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.4
Git-commit: 0a7dd4e901b8a4ee040ba953900d1d7120b34ee5

[ Upstream commit 0a7dd4e901b8a4ee040ba953900d1d7120b34ee5 ]

When multiple locks are acquired, they should be released in reverse
order. For s_start() and s_stop() in mm/vmalloc.c, that is not the
case.

  s_start: mutex_lock(&vmap_purge_lock); spin_lock(&vmap_area_lock);
  s_stop : mutex_unlock(&vmap_purge_lock); spin_unlock(&vmap_area_lock);

This unlock sequence, though allowed, is not optimal. If a waiter is
present, mutex_unlock() will need to go through the slowpath of waking
up the waiter with preemption disabled. Fix that by releasing the
spinlock first before the mutex.
