Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: omap3: n900: Correct obsolete TWL4030 power
 compatible
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.63
Git-commit: 3862123e9b56663c7a3e4a308e6e65bffe44f646

[ Upstream commit 3862123e9b56663c7a3e4a308e6e65bffe44f646 ]

The "ti,twl4030-power-n900" compatible string is obsolete and is not
supported by any in-kernel driver. Currently, the kernel falls back to
the second entry, "ti,twl4030-power-idle-osc-off", to bind a driver to
this node.

Make this fallback explicit by removing the obsolete board-specific
compatible. This preserves the existing functionality while making the
DTS compliant with the new, stricter 'ti,twl.yaml' binding.
