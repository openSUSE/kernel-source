Subject: [PATCH] media: ov01a10: Enable runtime PM before registering async
 sub-device
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.3
Git-commit: 47a78052db51b16e8045524fbf33373b58f1323b

commit 47a78052db51b16e8045524fbf33373b58f1323b upstream.

As the sensor device maybe accessible right after its async sub-device is
registered, such as ipu-bridge will try to power up sensor by sensor's
client device's runtime PM from the async notifier callback, if runtime PM
is not enabled, it will fail.

So runtime PM should be ready before its async sub-device is registered
and accessible by others.

It also sets the runtime PM status to active as the sensor was turned
on by i2c-core.
