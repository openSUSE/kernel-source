Subject: [PATCH] net: dsa: b53: VLAN filtering is global to all users
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.11
Git-commit: d45c36bafb94e72fdb6dee437279b61b6d97e706

commit d45c36bafb94e72fdb6dee437279b61b6d97e706 upstream.

The bcm_sf2 driver uses the b53 driver as a library but does not make
usre of the b53_setup() function, this made it fail to inherit the
vlan_filtering_is_global attribute. Fix this by moving the assignment to
b53_switch_alloc() which is used by bcm_sf2.
