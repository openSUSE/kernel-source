Subject: [PATCH] fs/proc/array.c: allow reporting eip/esp for all coredumping
 threads
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.16
Git-commit: cb8f381f1613cafe3aec30809991cd56e7135d92

commit cb8f381f1613cafe3aec30809991cd56e7135d92 upstream.

0a1eb2d474ed ("fs/proc: Stop reporting eip and esp in /proc/PID/stat")
stopped reporting eip/esp and fd7d56270b52 ("fs/proc: Report eip/esp in
/prod/PID/stat for coredumping") reintroduced the feature to fix a
regression with userspace core dump handlers (such as minicoredumper).

Because PF_DUMPCORE is only set for the primary thread, this didn't fix
the original problem for secondary threads.  Allow reporting the eip/esp
for all threads by checking for PF_EXITING as well.  This is set for all
the other threads when they are killed.  coredump_wait() waits for all the
tasks to become inactive before proceeding to invoke a core dumper.
