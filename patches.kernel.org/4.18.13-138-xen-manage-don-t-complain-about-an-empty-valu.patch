Subject: [PATCH] xen/manage: don't complain about an empty value in
 control/sysrq node
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.13
Git-commit: 87dffe86d406bee8782cac2db035acb9a28620a7

[ Upstream commit 87dffe86d406bee8782cac2db035acb9a28620a7 ]

When guest receives a sysrq request from the host it acknowledges it by
writing '\0' to control/sysrq xenstore node. This, however, make xenstore
watch fire again but xenbus_scanf() fails to parse empty value with "%c"
format string:

 sysrq: SysRq : Emergency Sync
 Emergency Sync complete
 xen:manage: Error -34 reading sysrq code in control/sysrq

Ignore -ERANGE the same way we already ignore -ENOENT, empty value in
control/sysrq is totally legal.
