Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: timer: renesas, cmt: Fix SoC-specific compatible
 values
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.5
Git-commit: e20824e944c3bf4352fcd8d9f446c41b53901e7b

[ Upstream commit e20824e944c3bf4352fcd8d9f446c41b53901e7b ]

While the new family-specific compatible values introduced by commit
6f54cc1adcc8957f ("devicetree: bindings: R-Car Gen2 CMT0 and CMT1
bindings") use the recommended order "<vendor>,<family>-<device>", the
new SoC-specific compatible values still use the old and deprecated
order "<vendor>,<device>-<soc>".

Switch the SoC-specific compatible values to the recommended order while
there are no upstream users of these compatible values yet.

Fixes: 7f03a0ecfdc786c1 ("devicetree: bindings: r8a73a4 and R-Car Gen2 CMT bindings")
Fixes: 63d9e8ca0dd4bfa4 ("devicetree: bindings: Deprecate property, update example")
