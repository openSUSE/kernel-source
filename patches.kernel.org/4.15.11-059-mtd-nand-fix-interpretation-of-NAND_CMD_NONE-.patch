Subject: [PATCH] mtd: nand: fix interpretation of NAND_CMD_NONE in
 nand_command[_lp]()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.11
Git-commit: df467899da0b71465760b4e35127bce837244eee

[ Upstream commit df467899da0b71465760b4e35127bce837244eee ]

Some drivers (like nand_hynix.c) call ->cmdfunc() with NAND_CMD_NONE
and a column address and expect the controller to only send address
cycles. Right now, the default ->cmdfunc() implementations provided by
the core do not filter out the command cycle in this case and forwards
the request to the controller driver through the ->cmd_ctrl() method.
The thing is, NAND controller drivers can get this wrong and send a
command cycle with a NAND_CMD_NONE opcode and since NAND_CMD_NONE is
-1, and the command field is usually casted to an u8, we end up sending
the 0xFF command which is actually a RESET operation.

Add conditions in nand_command[_lp]() functions to sending the initial
command cycle when command == NAND_CMD_NONE.
