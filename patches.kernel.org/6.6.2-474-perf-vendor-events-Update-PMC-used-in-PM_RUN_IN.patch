Subject: [PATCH] perf vendor events: Update PMC used in PM_RUN_INST_CMPL event
 for power10 platform
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.2
Git-commit: 3f8b6e5b11192dacb721d2d28ea4589917f5e822

[ Upstream commit 3f8b6e5b11192dacb721d2d28ea4589917f5e822 ]

The CPI_STALL_RATIO metric group can be used to present the high
level CPI stall breakdown metrics in powerpc, which will show:

- DISPATCH_STALL_CPI ( Dispatch stall cycles per insn )
- ISSUE_STALL_CPI ( Issue stall cycles per insn )
- EXECUTION_STALL_CPI ( Execution stall cycles per insn )
- COMPLETION_STALL_CPI ( Completion stall cycles per insn )

Commit cf26e043c2a9 ("perf vendor events power10: Add JSON
metric events to present CPI stall cycles in powerpc)" which added
the CPI_STALL_RATIO metric group, also modified
the PMC value used in PM_RUN_INST_CMPL event from PMC4 to PMC5,
to avoid multiplexing of events.
But that got revert in recent changes. Fix this issue by changing
back the PMC value used in PM_RUN_INST_CMPL to PMC5.

Result with the fix:

 ./perf stat --metric-no-group -M CPI_STALL_RATIO <workload>

 Performance counter stats for 'workload':

        68,745,426      PM_CMPL_STALL                    #     0.21 COMPLETION_STALL_CPI
         7,692,827      PM_ISSUE_STALL                   #     0.02 ISSUE_STALL_CPI
       322,638,223      PM_RUN_INST_CMPL                 #     0.05 DISPATCH_STALL_CPI
                                                  #     0.48 EXECUTION_STALL_CPI
        16,858,553      PM_DISP_STALL_CYC
       153,880,133      PM_EXEC_STALL

       0.089774592 seconds time elapsed

"--metric-no-group" is used for forcing PM_RUN_INST_CMPL to be scheduled
in all group for more accuracy.
