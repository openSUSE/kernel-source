Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sm8250-edo: Panel framebuffer is 2.5k
 instead of 4k
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.39
Git-commit: 223ce29c8b7e5b00f01a68387aabeefd77d97f06

[ Upstream commit 223ce29c8b7e5b00f01a68387aabeefd77d97f06 ]

The framebuffer configuration for edo pdx203, written in edo dtsi (which
is overwritten in pdx206 dts for its smaller panel) has to use a
1096x2560 configuration as this is what the panel (and framebuffer area)
has been initialized to.  Downstream userspace also has access to (and
uses) this 2.5k mode by default, and only switches the panel to 4k when
requested.

This is similar to commit be8de06dc397 ("arm64: dts: qcom:
sm8150-kumano: Panel framebuffer is 2.5k instead of 4k") which fixed the
same for the previous generation Sony platform.

Fixes: 69cdb97ef652 ("arm64: dts: qcom: sm8250: Add support for SONY Xperia 1 II / 5 II (Edo platform)")
