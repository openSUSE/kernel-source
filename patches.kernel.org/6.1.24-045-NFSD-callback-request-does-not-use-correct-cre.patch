Subject: [PATCH] NFSD: callback request does not use correct credential for
 AUTH_SYS
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.24
Git-commit: 7de82c2f36fb26aa78440bbf0efcf360b691d98b

[ Upstream commit 7de82c2f36fb26aa78440bbf0efcf360b691d98b ]

Currently callback request does not use the credential specified in
CREATE_SESSION if the security flavor for the back channel is AUTH_SYS.

Problem was discovered by pynfs 4.1 DELEG5 and DELEG7 test with error:
DELEG5   st_delegation.testCBSecParms     : FAILURE
           expected callback with uid, gid == 17, 19, got 0, 0
