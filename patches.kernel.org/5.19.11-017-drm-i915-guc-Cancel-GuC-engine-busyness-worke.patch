Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915/guc: Cancel GuC engine busyness worker synchronously
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.11
Git-commit: aee5ae7c8492eaca2be20d202887c9c716ffc86f

[ Upstream commit aee5ae7c8492eaca2be20d202887c9c716ffc86f ]

The worker is canceled in gt_park path, but earlier it was assumed that
gt_park path cannot sleep and the cancel is asynchronous. This caused a
race with suspend flow where the worker runs after suspend and causes an
unclaimed register access warning. Cancel the worker synchronously since
the gt_park is indeed allowed to sleep.
