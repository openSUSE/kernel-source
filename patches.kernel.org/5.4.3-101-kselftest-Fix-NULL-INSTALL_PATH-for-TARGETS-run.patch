Subject: [PATCH] kselftest: Fix NULL INSTALL_PATH for TARGETS runlist
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.3
Git-commit: 02bf1f8b3c43eec5053c35c14fb9f138186b4123

[ Upstream commit 02bf1f8b3c43eec5053c35c14fb9f138186b4123 ]

As per commit 131b30c94fbc ("kselftest: exclude failed TARGETS from
runlist") failed targets were excluded from the runlist. But value
$$INSTALL_PATH is always NULL. It should be $INSTALL_PATH instead
$$INSTALL_PATH.

So, fix Makefile to use $INSTALL_PATH.

Fixes: 131b30c94fbc ("kselftest: exclude failed TARGETS from runlist")
