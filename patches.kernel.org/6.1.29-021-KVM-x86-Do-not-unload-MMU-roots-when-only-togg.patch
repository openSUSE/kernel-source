Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: Do not unload MMU roots when only toggling CR0.WP
 with TDP enabled
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.29
Git-commit: 01b31714bd90be2784f7145bf93b7f78f3d081e1

[ Upstream commit 01b31714bd90be2784f7145bf93b7f78f3d081e1 ]

There is no need to unload the MMU roots with TDP enabled when only
CR0.WP has changed -- the paging structures are still valid, only the
permission bitmap needs to be updated.

One heavy user of toggling CR0.WP is grsecurity's KERNEXEC feature to
implement kernel W^X.

The optimization brings a huge performance gain for this case as the
following micro-benchmark running 'ssdd 10 50000' from rt-tests[1] on a
grsecurity L1 VM shows (runtime in seconds, lower is better):

                       legacy     TDP    shadow
kvm-x86/next@d8708b     8.43s    9.45s    70.3s
             +patch     5.39s    5.63s    70.2s

For legacy MMU this is ~36% faster, for TDP MMU even ~40% faster. Also
TDP and legacy MMU now both have a similar runtime which vanishes the
need to disable TDP MMU for grsecurity.

Shadow MMU sees no measurable difference and is still slow, as expected.
