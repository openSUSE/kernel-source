Subject: [PATCH] rxrpc: Call state should be read with READ_ONCE() under some
 circumstances
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.10
Git-commit: a95d25dd7b94a5ba18246da09b4218f132fed60e

[ Upstream commit a95d25dd7b94a5ba18246da09b4218f132fed60e ]

The call state may be changed at any time by the data-ready routine in
response to received packets, so if the call state is to be read and acted
upon several times in a function, READ_ONCE() must be used unless the call
state lock is held.

As it happens, we used READ_ONCE() to read the state a few lines above the
unmarked read in rxrpc_input_data(), so use that value rather than
re-reading it.
