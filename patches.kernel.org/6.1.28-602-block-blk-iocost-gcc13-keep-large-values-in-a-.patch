Subject: [PATCH] block/blk-iocost (gcc13): keep large values in a new enum
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.28
Git-commit: ff1cc97b1f4c10db224f276d9615b22835b8c424

commit ff1cc97b1f4c10db224f276d9615b22835b8c424 upstream.

Since gcc13, each member of an enum has the same type as the enum [1]. And
that is inherited from its members. Provided:
  VTIME_PER_SEC_SHIFT     = 37,
  VTIME_PER_SEC           = 1LLU << VTIME_PER_SEC_SHIFT,
  ...
  AUTOP_CYCLE_NSEC        = 10LLU * NSEC_PER_SEC,
the named type is unsigned long.

This generates warnings with gcc-13:
  block/blk-iocost.c: In function 'ioc_weight_prfill':
  block/blk-iocost.c:3037:37: error: format '%u' expects argument of type 'unsigned int', but argument 4 has type 'long unsigned int'

  block/blk-iocost.c: In function 'ioc_weight_show':
  block/blk-iocost.c:3047:34: error: format '%u' expects argument of type 'unsigned int', but argument 3 has type 'long unsigned int'

So split the anonymous enum with large values to a separate enum, so
that they don't affect other members.
