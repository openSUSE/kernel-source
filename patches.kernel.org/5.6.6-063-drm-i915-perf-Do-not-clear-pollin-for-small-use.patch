Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915/perf: Do not clear pollin for small user read
 buffers
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.6
Git-commit: bcad588dea538a4fc173d16a90a005536ec8dbf2

commit bcad588dea538a4fc173d16a90a005536ec8dbf2 upstream.

It is wrong to block the user thread in the next poll when OA data is
already available which could not fit in the user buffer provided in
the previous read. In several cases the exact user buffer size is not
known. Blocking user space in poll can lead to data loss when the
buffer size used is smaller than the available data.

This change fixes this issue and allows user space to read all OA data
even when using a buffer size smaller than the available data using
multiple non-blocking reads rather than staying blocked in poll till
the next timer interrupt.

v2: Fix ret value for blocking reads (Umesh)
v3: Mistake during patch send (Ashutosh)
v4: Remove -EAGAIN from comment (Umesh)
v5: Improve condition for clearing pollin and return (Lionel)
v6: Improve blocking read loop and other cleanups (Lionel)
v7: Added Cc stable
