Subject: [PATCH] bpf: Fix BTF_ID symbol generation collision
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.6
Git-commit: 8f908db77782630c45ba29dac35c434b5ce0b730

commit 8f908db77782630c45ba29dac35c434b5ce0b730 upstream.

Marcus and Satya reported an issue where BTF_ID macro generates same
symbol in separate objects and that breaks final vmlinux link.

ld.lld: error: ld-temp.o <inline asm>:14577:1: symbol
'__BTF_ID__struct__cgroup__624' is already defined

This can be triggered under specific configs when __COUNTER__ happens to
be the same for the same symbol in two different translation units,
which is already quite unlikely to happen.

Add __LINE__ number suffix to make BTF_ID symbol more unique, which is
not a complete fix, but it would help for now and meanwhile we can work
on better solution as suggested by Andrii.
