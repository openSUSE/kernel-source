Subject: [PATCH] arm64: cpufeature: Don't treat granule sizes as strict
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.12
Git-commit: 5717fe5ab38f9ccb32718bcb03bea68409c9cce4

[ Upstream commit 5717fe5ab38f9ccb32718bcb03bea68409c9cce4 ]

If a CPU doesn't support the page size for which the kernel is
configured, then we will complain and refuse to bring it online. For
secondary CPUs (and the boot CPU on a system booting with EFI), we will
also print an error identifying the mismatch.

Consequently, the only time that the cpufeature code can detect a
granule size mismatch is for a granule other than the one that is
currently being used. Although we would rather such systems didn't
exist, we've unfortunately lost that battle and Kevin reports that
on his amlogic S922X (odroid-n2 board) we end up warning and taining
with defconfig because 16k pages are not supported by all of the CPUs.

In such a situation, we don't actually care about the feature mismatch,
particularly now that KVM only exposes the sanitised view of the CPU
registers (commit 93390c0a1b20 - "arm64: KVM: Hide unsupported AArch64
CPU features from guests"). Treat the granule fields as non-strict and
let Kevin run without a tainted kernel.
