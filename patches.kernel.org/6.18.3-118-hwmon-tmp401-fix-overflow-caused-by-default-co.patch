Subject: [PATCH] hwmon: (tmp401) fix overflow caused by default conversion
 rate value
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.3
Git-commit: 82f2aab35a1ab2e1460de06ef04c726460aed51c

[ Upstream commit 82f2aab35a1ab2e1460de06ef04c726460aed51c ]

The driver computes conversion intervals using the formula:

    interval = (1 << (7 - rate)) * 125ms

where 'rate' is the sensor's conversion rate register value. According to
the datasheet, the power-on reset value of this register is 0x8, which
could be assigned to the register, after handling i2c general call.
Using this default value causes a result greater than the bit width of
left operand and an undefined behaviour in the calculation above, since
shifting by values larger than the bit width is undefined behaviour as
per C language standard.

Limit the maximum usable 'rate' value to 7 to prevent undefined
behaviour in calculations.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Svace.

Note (groeck):
    This does not matter in practice unless someone overwrites the chip
    configuration from outside the driver while the driver is loaded.
    The conversion time register is initialized with a value of 5 (500ms)
    when the driver is loaded, and the driver never writes a bad value.
