Subject: [PATCH] net: phy: Warn about incorrect mdio_bus_phy_resume() state
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.4
Git-commit: 744d23c71af39c7dc77ac7c3cac87ae86a181a85

commit 744d23c71af39c7dc77ac7c3cac87ae86a181a85 upstream.

Calling mdio_bus_phy_resume() with neither the PHY state machine set to
PHY_HALTED nor phydev->mac_managed_pm set to true is a good indication
that we can produce a race condition looking like this:

CPU0						CPU1
bcmgenet_resume
 -> phy_resume
   -> phy_init_hw
 -> phy_start
   -> phy_resume
                                                phy_start_aneg()
mdio_bus_phy_resume
 -> phy_resume
    -> phy_write(..., BMCR_RESET)
     -> usleep()                                  -> phy_read()

with the phy_resume() function triggering a PHY behavior that might have
to be worked around with (see bf8bfc4336f7 ("net: phy: broadcom: Fix
brcm_fet_config_init()") for instance) that ultimately leads to an error
reading from the PHY.
