Subject: [PATCH] s390/smp: Fix fallback CPU detection
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.63
Git-commit: 07a75d08cfa1b883a6e1256666e5f0617ee99231

[ Upstream commit 07a75d08cfa1b883a6e1256666e5f0617ee99231 ]

In case SCLP CPU detection does not work a fallback mechanism using SIGP is
in place. Since a cleanup this does not work correctly anymore: new CPUs
are only considered if their type matches the boot CPU.

Before the cleanup the information if a CPU type should be considered was
also part of a structure generated by the fallback mechanism and indicated
that a CPU type should not be considered when adding CPUs.

Since the rework a global SCLP state is used instead. If the global SCLP
state indicates that the CPU type should be considered and the fallback
mechanism is used, there may be a mismatch with CPU types if CPUs are
added. This can lead to a system with only a single CPU even tough there
are many more CPUs.

Address this by simply copying the boot cpu type into the generated data
structure from the fallback mechanism.
