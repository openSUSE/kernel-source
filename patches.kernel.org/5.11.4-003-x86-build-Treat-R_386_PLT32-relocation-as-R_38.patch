Subject: [PATCH] x86/build: Treat R_386_PLT32 relocation as R_386_PC32
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.4
Git-commit: bb73d07148c405c293e576b40af37737faf23a6a

commit bb73d07148c405c293e576b40af37737faf23a6a upstream.

This is similar to commit

  b21ebf2fb4cd ("x86: Treat R_X86_64_PLT32 as R_X86_64_PC32")

but for i386. As far as the kernel is concerned, R_386_PLT32 can be
treated the same as R_386_PC32.

R_386_PLT32/R_X86_64_PLT32 are PC-relative relocation types which
can only be used by branches. If the referenced symbol is defined
externally, a PLT will be used.

R_386_PC32/R_X86_64_PC32 are PC-relative relocation types which can be
used by address taking operations and branches. If the referenced symbol
is defined externally, a copy relocation/canonical PLT entry will be
created in the executable.

On x86-64, there is no PIC vs non-PIC PLT distinction and an
R_X86_64_PLT32 relocation is produced for both `call/jmp foo` and
`call/jmp foo@PLT` with newer (2018) GNU as/LLVM integrated assembler.
This avoids canonical PLT entries (st_shndx=0, st_value!=0).

On i386, there are 2 types of PLTs, PIC and non-PIC. Currently,
the GCC/GNU as convention is to use R_386_PC32 for non-PIC PLT and
R_386_PLT32 for PIC PLT. Copy relocations/canonical PLT entries
are possible ABI issues but GCC/GNU as will likely keep the status
quo because (1) the ABI is legacy (2) the change will drop a GNU
ld diagnostic for non-default visibility ifunc in shared objects.

clang-12 -fno-pic (since [1]) can emit R_386_PLT32 for compiler
generated function declarations, because preventing canonical PLT
entries is weighed over the rare ifunc diagnostic.
