Subject: [PATCH] mm/swap: use nr_node_ids for avail_lists in swap_info_struct
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.5
Git-commit: 66f71da9dd38af17dc17209cdde7987d4679a699

[ Upstream commit 66f71da9dd38af17dc17209cdde7987d4679a699 ]

Since a2468cc9bfdf ("swap: choose swap device according to numa node"),
avail_lists field of swap_info_struct is changed to an array with
MAX_NUMNODES elements.  This made swap_info_struct size increased to 40KiB
and needs an order-4 page to hold it.

This is not optimal in that:
1 Most systems have way less than MAX_NUMNODES(1024) nodes so it
  is a waste of memory;
2 It could cause swapon failure if the swap device is swapped on
  after system has been running for a while, due to no order-4
  page is available as pointed out by Vasily Averin.

Solve the above two issues by using nr_node_ids(which is the actual
possible node number the running system has) for avail_lists instead of
MAX_NUMNODES.

nr_node_ids is unknown at compile time so can't be directly used when
declaring this array.  What I did here is to declare avail_lists as zero
element array and allocate space for it when allocating space for
swap_info_struct.  The reason why keep using array but not pointer is
plist_for_each_entry needs the field to be part of the struct, so pointer
will not work.

This patch is on top of Vasily Averin's fix commit.  I think the use of
kvzalloc for swap_info_struct is still needed in case nr_node_ids is
really big on some systems.
