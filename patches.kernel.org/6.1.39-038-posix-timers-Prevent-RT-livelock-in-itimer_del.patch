Subject: [PATCH] posix-timers: Prevent RT livelock in itimer_delete()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.39
Git-commit: 9d9e522010eb5685d8b53e8a24320653d9d4cbbf

[ Upstream commit 9d9e522010eb5685d8b53e8a24320653d9d4cbbf ]

itimer_delete() has a retry loop when the timer is concurrently expired. On
non-RT kernels this just spin-waits until the timer callback has completed,
except for posix CPU timers which have HAVE_POSIX_CPU_TIMERS_TASK_WORK
enabled.

In that case and on RT kernels the existing task could live lock when
preempting the task which does the timer delivery.

Replace spin_unlock() with an invocation of timer_wait_running() to handle
it the same way as the other retry loops in the posix timer code.

Fixes: ec8f954a40da ("posix-timers: Use a callback for cancel synchronization on PREEMPT_RT")
