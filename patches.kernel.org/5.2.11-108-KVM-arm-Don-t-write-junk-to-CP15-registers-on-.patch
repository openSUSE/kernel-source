Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm: Don't write junk to CP15 registers on reset
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.11
Git-commit: c69509c70aa45a8c4954c88c629a64acf4ee4a36

[ Upstream commit c69509c70aa45a8c4954c88c629a64acf4ee4a36 ]

At the moment, the way we reset CP15 registers is mildly insane:
We write junk to them, call the reset functions, and then check that
we have something else in them.

The "fun" thing is that this can happen while the guest is running
(PSCI, for example). If anything in KVM has to evaluate the state
of a CP15 register while junk is in there, bad thing may happen.

Let's stop doing that. Instead, we track that we have called a
reset function for that register, and assume that the reset
function has done something.

In the end, the very need of this reset check is pretty dubious,
as it doesn't check everything (a lot of the CP15 reg leave outside
of the cp15_regs[] array). It may well be axed in the near future.
