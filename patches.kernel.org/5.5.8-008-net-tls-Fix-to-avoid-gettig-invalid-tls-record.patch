Subject: [PATCH] net/tls: Fix to avoid gettig invalid tls record
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.8
Git-commit: 06f5201c6392f998a49ca9c9173e2930c8eb51d8

[ Upstream commit 06f5201c6392f998a49ca9c9173e2930c8eb51d8 ]

Current code doesn't check if tcp sequence number is starting from (/after)
1st record's start sequnce number. It only checks if seq number is before
1st record's end sequnce number. This problem will always be a possibility
in re-transmit case. If a record which belongs to a requested seq number is
already deleted, tls_get_record will start looking into list and as per the
check it will look if seq number is before the end seq of 1st record, which
will always be true and will return 1st record always, it should in fact
return NULL.
As part of the fix, start looking each record only if the sequence number
lies in the list else return NULL.
There is one more check added, driver look for the start marker record to
handle tcp packets which are before the tls offload start sequence number,
hence return 1st record if the record is tls start marker and seq number is
before the 1st record's starting sequence number.
