Subject: [PATCH] dlm: Don't swamp the CPU with callbacks queued during
 recovery
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.8
Git-commit: 216f0efd19b9cc32207934fd1b87a45f2c4c593e

[ Upstream commit 216f0efd19b9cc32207934fd1b87a45f2c4c593e ]

Before this patch, recovery would cause all callbacks to be delayed,
put on a queue, and afterward they were all queued to the callback
work queue. This patch does the same thing, but occasionally takes
a break after 25 of them so it won't swamp the CPU at the expense
of other RT processes like corosync.
