Subject: [PATCH] x86/entry/64: Use JMP instead of JMPQ
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.7
Git-commit: 64dbc122b20f75183d8822618c24f85144a5a94d

commit 64dbc122b20f75183d8822618c24f85144a5a94d upstream

Somehow the swapgs mitigation entry code patch ended up with a JMPQ
instruction instead of JMP, where only the short jump is needed.  Some
assembler versions apparently fail to optimize JMPQ into a two-byte JMP
when possible, instead always using a 7-byte JMP with relocation.  For
some reason that makes the entry code explode with a #GP during boot.

Change it back to "JMP" as originally intended.

Fixes: 18ec54fdd6d1 ("x86/speculation: Prepare entry code for Spectre v1 swapgs mitigations")
