Subject: [PATCH] net: When removing nexthops, don't call synchronize_net if it
 is not necessary
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.8
Git-commit: b0ac6d3b56a2384db151696cfda2836a8a961b6d

[ Upstream commit b0ac6d3b56a2384db151696cfda2836a8a961b6d ]

When removing a nexthop, commit
90f33bffa382 ("nexthops: don't modify published nexthop groups") added a
call to synchronize_rcu() (later changed to _net()) to make sure
everyone sees the new nexthop-group before the rtnl-lock is released.

When one wants to delete a large number of groups and nexthops, it is
fastest to first flush the groups (ip nexthop flush groups) and then
flush the nexthops themselves (ip -6 nexthop flush). As that way the
groups don't need to be rebalanced.

However, `ip -6 nexthop flush` will still take a long time if there is
a very large number of nexthops because of the call to
synchronize_net(). Now, if there are no more groups, there is no point
in calling synchronize_net(). So, let's skip that entirely by checking
if nh->grp_list is empty.

This gives us a nice speedup:

BEFORE:
=======

$ time sudo ip -6 nexthop flush
Dump was interrupted and may be inconsistent.
Flushed 2097152 nexthops

real	1m45.345s
user	0m0.001s
sys	0m0.005s

$ time sudo ip -6 nexthop flush
Dump was interrupted and may be inconsistent.
Flushed 4194304 nexthops

real	3m10.430s
user	0m0.002s
sys	0m0.004s

AFTER:
======

$ time sudo ip -6 nexthop flush
