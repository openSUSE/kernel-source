Subject: [PATCH] media: cec: core: add adap_nb_transmit_canceled() callback
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.53
Git-commit: da53c36ddd3f118a525a04faa8c47ca471e6c467

[ Upstream commit da53c36ddd3f118a525a04faa8c47ca471e6c467 ]

A potential deadlock was found by Zheng Zhang with a local syzkaller
instance.

The problem is that when a non-blocking CEC transmit is canceled by calling
cec_data_cancel, that in turn can call the high-level received() driver
callback, which can call cec_transmit_msg() to transmit a new message.

The cec_data_cancel() function is called with the adap->lock mutex held,
and cec_transmit_msg() tries to take that same lock.

The root cause is that the received() callback can either be used to pass
on a received message (and then adap->lock is not held), or to report a
canceled transmit (and then adap->lock is held).

This is confusing, so create a new low-level adap_nb_transmit_canceled
callback that reports back that a non-blocking transmit was canceled.

And the received() callback is only called when a message is received,
as was the case before commit f9d0ecbf56f4 ("media: cec: correctly pass
on reply results") complicated matters.
