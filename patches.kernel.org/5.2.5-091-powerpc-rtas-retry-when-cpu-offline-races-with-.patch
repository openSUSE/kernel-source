Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/rtas: retry when cpu offline races with
 suspend/migration
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.5
Git-commit: 9fb603050ffd94f8127df99c699cca2f575eb6a0

[ Upstream commit 9fb603050ffd94f8127df99c699cca2f575eb6a0 ]

The protocol for suspending or migrating an LPAR requires all present
processor threads to enter H_JOIN. So if we have threads offline, we
have to temporarily bring them up. This can race with administrator
actions such as SMT state changes. As of dfd718a2ed1f ("powerpc/rtas:
Fix a potential race between CPU-Offline & Migration"),
rtas_ibm_suspend_me() accounts for this, but errors out with -EBUSY
for what almost certainly is a transient condition in any reasonable
scenario.

Callers of rtas_ibm_suspend_me() already retry when -EAGAIN is
returned, and it is typical during a migration for that to happen
repeatedly for several minutes polling the H_VASI_STATE hcall result
before proceeding to the next stage.

So return -EAGAIN instead of -EBUSY when this race is
encountered. Additionally: logging this event is still appropriate but
use pr_info instead of pr_err; and remove use of unlikely() while here
as this is not a hot path at all.
