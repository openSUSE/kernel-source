Subject: [PATCH] regulator: core: resolve supply for boot-on/always-on
 regulators
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.11
Git-commit: 98e48cd9283dbac0e1445ee780889f10b3d1db6a

commit 98e48cd9283dbac0e1445ee780889f10b3d1db6a upstream.

For the boot-on/always-on regulators the set_machine_constrainst() is
called before resolving rdev->supply. Thus the code would try to enable
rdev before enabling supplying regulator. Enforce resolving supply
regulator before enabling rdev.

Fixes: aea6cb99703e ("regulator: resolve supply after creating regulator")
