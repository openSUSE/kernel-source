Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: check for commit error at
 btrfs_attach_transaction_barrier()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.43
Git-commit: b28ff3a7d7e97456fd86b68d24caa32e1cfa7064

commit b28ff3a7d7e97456fd86b68d24caa32e1cfa7064 upstream.

btrfs_attach_transaction_barrier() is used to get a handle pointing to the
current running transaction if the transaction has not started its commit
yet (its state is < TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_START). If the transaction commit
has started, then we wait for the transaction to commit and finish before
returning - however we completely ignore if the transaction was aborted
due to some error during its commit, we simply return ERR_PT(-ENOENT),
which makes the caller assume everything is fine and no errors happened.

This could make an fsync return success (0) to user space when in fact we
had a transaction abort and the target inode changes were therefore not
persisted.

Fix this by checking for the return value from btrfs_wait_for_commit(),
and if it returned an error, return it back to the caller.
