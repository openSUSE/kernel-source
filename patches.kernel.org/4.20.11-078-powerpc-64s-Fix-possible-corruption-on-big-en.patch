Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/64s: Fix possible corruption on big endian due to
 pgd/pud_present()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.11
Git-commit: a58007621be33e9f7c7bed5d5ff8ecb914e1044a

commit a58007621be33e9f7c7bed5d5ff8ecb914e1044a upstream.

In v4.20 we changed our pgd/pud_present() to check for _PAGE_PRESENT
rather than just checking that the value is non-zero, e.g.:

  static inline int pgd_present(pgd_t pgd)
  {
 -       return !pgd_none(pgd);
 +       return (pgd_raw(pgd) & cpu_to_be64(_PAGE_PRESENT));
  }

Unfortunately this is broken on big endian, as the result of the
bitwise & is truncated to int, which is always zero because
_PAGE_PRESENT is 0x8000000000000000ul. This means pgd_present() and
pud_present() are always false at compile time, and the compiler
elides the subsequent code.

Remarkably with that bug present we are still able to boot and run
with few noticeable effects. However under some work loads we are able
to trigger a warning in the ext4 code:

  WARNING: CPU: 11 PID: 29593 at fs/ext4/inode.c:3927 .ext4_set_page_dirty+0x70/0xb0
  CPU: 11 PID: 29593 Comm: debugedit Not tainted 4.20.0-rc1 #1
  ...
  NIP .ext4_set_page_dirty+0x70/0xb0
  LR  .set_page_dirty+0xa0/0x150
  Call Trace:
   .set_page_dirty+0xa0/0x150

   .__vm_munmap+0x80/0x110
   .__se_sys_munmap+0x14/0x30
   system_call+0x5c/0x70

The fix is simple, we need to convert the result of the bitwise & to
an int before returning it.

Thanks to Erhard, Jan Kara and Aneesh for help with debugging.
