Subject: [PATCH] x86/vsyscall: Do not require X86_PF_INSTR to emulate vsyscall
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.8
Git-commit: 8ba38a7a9a699905b84fa97578a8291010dec273

[ Upstream commit 8ba38a7a9a699905b84fa97578a8291010dec273 ]

emulate_vsyscall() expects to see X86_PF_INSTR in PFEC on a vsyscall
page fault, but the CPU does not report X86_PF_INSTR if neither
X86_FEATURE_NX nor X86_FEATURE_SMEP are enabled.

X86_FEATURE_NX should be enabled on nearly all 64-bit CPUs, except for
early P4 processors that did not support this feature.

Instead of explicitly checking for X86_PF_INSTR, compare the fault
address to RIP.

On machines with X86_FEATURE_NX enabled, issue a warning if RIP is equal
to fault address but X86_PF_INSTR is absent.
