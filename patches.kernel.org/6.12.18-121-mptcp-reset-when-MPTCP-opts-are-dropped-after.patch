Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: reset when MPTCP opts are dropped after join
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.18
Git-commit: 8668860b0ad32a13fcd6c94a0995b7aa7638c9ef

commit 8668860b0ad32a13fcd6c94a0995b7aa7638c9ef upstream.

Before this patch, if the checksum was not used, the subflow was only
reset if map_data_len was != 0. If there were no MPTCP options or an
invalid mapping, map_data_len was not set to the data len, and then the
subflow was not reset as it should have been, leaving the MPTCP
connection in a wrong fallback mode.

This map_data_len condition has been introduced to handle the reception
of the infinite mapping. Instead, a new dedicated mapping error could
have been returned and treated as a special case. However, the commit
31bf11de146c ("mptcp: introduce MAPPING_BAD_CSUM") has been introduced
by Paolo Abeni soon after, and backported later on to stable. It better
handle the csum case, and it means the exception for valid_csum_seen in
subflow_can_fallback(), plus this one for the infinite mapping in
subflow_check_data_avail(), are no longer needed.

In other words, the code can be simplified there: a fallback should only
be done if msk->allow_infinite_fallback is set. This boolean is set to
false once MPTCP-specific operations acting on the whole MPTCP
connection vs the initial path have been done, e.g. a second path has
been created, or an MPTCP re-injection -- yes, possible even with a
single subflow. The subflow_can_fallback() helper can then be dropped,
and replaced by this single condition.

This also makes the code clearer: a fallback should only be done if it
is possible to do so.

While at it, no need to set map_data_len to 0 in get_mapping_status()
for the infinite mapping case: it will be set to skb->len just after, at
the end of subflow_check_data_avail(), and not read in between.
