Subject: [PATCH] scsi: mpt3sas: Fix IO error occurs on pulling out a drive
 from RAID1 volume created on two SATA drive
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.9
Git-commit: 2ce9a3645299ba1752873d333d73f67620f4550b

[ Upstream commit 2ce9a3645299ba1752873d333d73f67620f4550b ]

Whenever an I/O for a RAID volume fails with IOCStatus
MPI2_IOCSTATUS_SCSI_IOC_TERMINATED and SCSIStatus equal to
(MPI2_SCSI_STATE_TERMINATED | MPI2_SCSI_STATE_NO_SCSI_STATUS) then
return the I/O to SCSI midlayer with "DID_RESET" (i.e. retry the IO
infinite times) set in the host byte.

Previously, the driver was completing the I/O with "DID_SOFT_ERROR"
which causes the I/O to be quickly retried. However, firmware needed
more time and hence I/Os were failing.
