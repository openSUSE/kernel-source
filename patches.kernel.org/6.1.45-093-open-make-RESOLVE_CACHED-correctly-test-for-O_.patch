Subject: [PATCH] open: make RESOLVE_CACHED correctly test for O_TMPFILE
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.45
Git-commit: a0fc452a5d7fed986205539259df1d60546f536c

commit a0fc452a5d7fed986205539259df1d60546f536c upstream.

O_TMPFILE is actually __O_TMPFILE|O_DIRECTORY. This means that the old
fast-path check for RESOLVE_CACHED would reject all users passing
O_DIRECTORY with -EAGAIN, when in fact the intended test was to check
for __O_TMPFILE.
