[ Upstream commit c1a9acbc5295e278d788e9f7510f543bc9864fa2 ]

Intel SDM vol. 3, 5.3:
The processor causes a
general-protection exception (or, if the segment is SS, a stack-fault
exception) any time an attempt is made to access the following addresses
in a segment:
- A byte at an offset greater than the effective limit
- A word at an offset greater than the (effective-limit â€“ 1)
- A doubleword at an offset greater than the (effective-limit â€“ 3)
- A quadword at an offset greater than the (effective-limit â€“ 7)

Therefore, the generic limit checking error condition must be

exn = (off > limit + 1 - access_len) = (off + access_len - 1 > limit)

but not

exn = (off + access_len > limit)

as for now.

Also avoid integer overflow of `off` at 32-bit KVM by casting it to u64.

Note: access length is currently sizeof(u64) which is incorrect. This
will be fixed in the subsequent patch.
