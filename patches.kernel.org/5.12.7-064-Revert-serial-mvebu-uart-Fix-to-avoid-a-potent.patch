Subject: [PATCH] Revert "serial: mvebu-uart: Fix to avoid a potential NULL
 pointer dereference"
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.7
Git-commit: 754f39158441f4c0d7a8255209dd9a939f08ce80

commit 754f39158441f4c0d7a8255209dd9a939f08ce80 upstream.

This reverts commit 32f47179833b63de72427131169809065db6745e.

Because of recent interactions with developers from @umn.edu, all
commits from them have been recently re-reviewed to ensure if they were
correct or not.

Upon review, this commit was found to be not be needed at all as the
change was useless because this function can only be called when
of_match_device matched on something.  So it should be reverted.
