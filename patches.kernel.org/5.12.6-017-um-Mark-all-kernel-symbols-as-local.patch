[ Upstream commit d5027ca63e0e778b641cf23e3f5c6d6212cf412b ]

Ritesh reported a bug [1] against UML, noting that it crashed on
startup. The backtrace shows the following (heavily redacted):

(gdb) bt

indicating that the UML function openpty_cb() calls openpty(),
which internally calls __getgrnam_r(), which causes the nsswitch
machinery to get started.

This loads, through lots of indirection that I snipped, the
libcom_err.so.2 library, which (in an unknown function, "??")
calls sem_init().

Now, of course it wants to get libpthread's sem_init(), since
it's linked against libpthread. However, the dynamic linker
looks up that symbol against the binary first, and gets the
kernel's sem_init().

Hajime Tazaki noted that "objcopy -L" can localize a symbol,
so the dynamic linker wouldn't do the lookup this way. I tried,
but for some reason that didn't seem to work.

Doing the same thing in the linker script instead does seem to
work, though I cannot entirely explain - it *also* works if I
just add "VERSION { { global: *; }; }" instead, indicating that
something else is happening that I don't really understand. It
may be that explicitly doing that marks them with some kind of
empty version, and that's different from the default.

Explicitly marking them with a version breaks kallsyms, so that
doesn't seem to be possible.

Marking all the symbols as local seems correct, and does seem
to address the issue, so do that. Also do it for static link,
nsswitch libraries could still be loaded there.
