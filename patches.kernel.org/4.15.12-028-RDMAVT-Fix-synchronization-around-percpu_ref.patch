Subject: [PATCH] RDMAVT: Fix synchronization around percpu_ref
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.12
Git-commit: 74b44bbe80b4c62113ac1501482ea1ee40eb9d67

commit 74b44bbe80b4c62113ac1501482ea1ee40eb9d67 upstream.

rvt_mregion uses percpu_ref for reference counting and RCU to protect
accesses from lkey_table.  When a rvt_mregion needs to be freed, it
first gets unregistered from lkey_table and then rvt_check_refs() is
called to wait for in-flight usages before the rvt_mregion is freed.

rvt_check_refs() seems to have a couple issues.

* It has a fast exit path which tests percpu_ref_is_zero().  However,
  a percpu_ref reading zero doesn't mean that the object can be
  released.  In fact, the ->release() callback might not even have
  started executing yet.  Proceeding with freeing can lead to
  use-after-free.

* lkey_table is RCU protected but there is no RCU grace period in the
  free path.  percpu_ref uses RCU internally but it's sched-RCU whose
  grace periods are different from regular RCU.  Also, it generally
  isn't a good idea to depend on internal behaviors like this.

To address the above issues, this patch removes the fast exit and adds
an explicit synchronize_rcu().
