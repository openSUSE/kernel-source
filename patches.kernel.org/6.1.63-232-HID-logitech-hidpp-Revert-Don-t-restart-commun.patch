Subject: [PATCH] HID: logitech-hidpp: Revert "Don't restart communication if
 not necessary"
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.63
Git-commit: 55bf70362ffc4ddd7c8745e2fe880edac00e4aff

[ Upstream commit 55bf70362ffc4ddd7c8745e2fe880edac00e4aff ]

Commit 91cf9a98ae41 ("HID: logitech-hidpp: make .probe usbhid capable")
makes hidpp_probe() first call hid_hw_start(hdev, 0) to allow IO
without connecting any hid subdrivers (hid-input, hidraw).

This is done to allow to retrieve the device's name and serial number
and store these in hdev->name and hdev->uniq.

Then later on IO was stopped and started again with hid_hw_start(hdev,
HID_CONNECT_DEFAULT) connecting hid-input and hidraw after the name
and serial number have been setup.

Commit 498ba2069035 ("HID: logitech-hidpp: Don't restart communication
if not necessary") changed the probe() code to only do the start with
a 0 connect-mask + restart later for unifying devices.

But for non unifying devices hdev->name and hdev->uniq are updated too.
So this change re-introduces the problem for which the start with
a 0 connect-mask + restart later behavior was introduced.

The previous patch in this series changes the unifying path to instead of
restarting IO only call hid_connect() later. This avoids possible issues
with restarting IO seen on non unifying devices.

Revert the change to limit the restart behavior to unifying devices to
fix hdev->name changing after userspace facing devices have already been
registered.

This series has been tested on the following devices:
Logitech Bluetooth Laser Travel Mouse (bluetooth, HID++ 1.0)
Logitech M720 Triathlon (bluetooth, HID++ 4.5)
Logitech M720 Triathlon (unifying, HID++ 4.5)
Logitech K400 Pro (unifying, HID++ 4.1)
Logitech K270 (eQUAD nano Lite, HID++ 2.0)
Logitech M185 (eQUAD nano Lite, HID++ 4.5)
Logitech LX501 keyboard (27 Mhz, HID++ builtin scroll-wheel, HID++ 1.0)
Logitech M-RAZ105 mouse (27 Mhz, HID++ extra mouse buttons, HID++ 1.0)

And by bentiss:
Logitech Touchpad T650 (unifying)
Logitech Touchpad T651 (bluetooth)
Logitech MX Master 3B (BLE)
Logitech G403 (plain USB / Gaming receiver)
