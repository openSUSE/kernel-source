Subject: [PATCH] NFSD: Clear TIME_DELEG in the suppattr_exclcreat bitmap
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.3
Git-commit: ad3cbbb0c1892c48919727fcb8dec5965da8bacb

commit ad3cbbb0c1892c48919727fcb8dec5965da8bacb upstream.

>From RFC 8881:

5.8.1.14. Attribute 75: suppattr_exclcreat

> The bit vector that would set all REQUIRED and RECOMMENDED
> attributes that are supported by the EXCLUSIVE4_1 method of file
> creation via the OPEN operation. The scope of this attribute
> applies to all objects with a matching fsid.

There's nothing in RFC 8881 that states that suppattr_exclcreat is
or is not allowed to contain bits for attributes that are clear in
the reported supported_attrs bitmask. But it doesn't make sense for
an NFS server to indicate that it /doesn't/ implement an attribute,
but then also indicate that clients /are/ allowed to set that
attribute using OPEN(create) with EXCLUSIVE4_1.

The FATTR4_WORD2_TIME_DELEG attributes are also not to be allowed
for OPEN(create) with EXCLUSIVE4_1. It doesn't make sense to set
a delegated timestamp on a new file.
