Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/pseries: Don't fail hash page table insert for bolted
 mapping
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.8
Git-commit: 75838a3290cd4ebbd1f567f310ba04b6ef017ce4

[ Upstream commit 75838a3290cd4ebbd1f567f310ba04b6ef017ce4 ]

If the hypervisor returned H_PTEG_FULL for H_ENTER hcall, retry a hash page table
insert by removing a random entry from the group.

After some runtime, it is very well possible to find all the 8 hash page table
entry slot in the hpte group used for mapping. Don't fail a bolted entry insert
in that case. With Storage class memory a user can find this error easily since
a namespace enable/disable is equivalent to memory add/remove.

This results in failures as reported below:

$ ndctl create-namespace -r region1 -t pmem -m devdax -a 65536 -s 100M
libndctl: ndctl_dax_enable: dax1.3: failed to enable
  Error: namespace1.2: failed to enable

failed to create namespace: No such device or address

In kernel log we find the details as below:

Unable to create mapping for hot added memory 0xc000042006000000..0xc00004200d000000: -1
dax_pmem: probe of dax1.3 failed with error -14

This indicates that we failed to create a bolted hash table entry for direct-map
address backing the namespace.

We also observe failures such that not all namespaces will be enabled with
ndctl enable-namespace all command.
