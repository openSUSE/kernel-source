Subject: [PATCH] ARM: at91: pm: fix imbalanced reference counter for ethernet
 devices
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.34
Git-commit: ccd4923d18d5698a5910d516646ce125b9155d47

[ Upstream commit ccd4923d18d5698a5910d516646ce125b9155d47 ]

The of_find_device_by_node() function is returning a struct platform_device
object with the embedded struct device member's reference counter
incremented. This needs to be dropped when done with the platform device
returned by of_find_device_by_node().

at91_pm_eth_quirk_is_valid() calls of_find_device_by_node() on
suspend and resume path. On suspend it calls of_find_device_by_node() and
on resume and failure paths it drops the counter of
struct platform_device::dev.

In case ethernet device may not wakeup there is a put_device() on
at91_pm_eth_quirk_is_valid() which is wrong as it colides with
put_device() on resume path leading to the reference counter of struct
device embedded in struct platform_device to be messed, stack trace to be
displayed (after 5 consecutive suspend/resume cycles) and execution to
hang.

Along with this the error path of at91_pm_config_quirks() had been also
adapted to decrement propertly the reference counter of struct device
embedded in struct platform_device.
