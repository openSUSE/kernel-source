Subject: [PATCH] padata: Honor the caller's alignment in case of chunk_size 0

[ Upstream commit 24cc57d8faaa4060fd58adf810b858fcfb71a02f ]

In the case where we are forcing the ps.chunk_size to be at least 1,
we are ignoring the caller's alignment.

Move the forcing of ps.chunk_size to be at least 1 before rounding it
up to caller's alignment, so that caller's alignment is honored.

While at it, use max() to force the ps.chunk_size to be at least 1 to
improve readability.
