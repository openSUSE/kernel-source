Subject: [PATCH] ceph: reconnect connection if session hang in opening state
References: bnc#1151927
Patch-mainline: 5.3.6
Git-commit: 71a228bc8d65900179e37ac309e678f8c523f133

[ Upstream commit 71a228bc8d65900179e37ac309e678f8c523f133 ]

If client mds session is evicted in CEPH_MDS_SESSION_OPENING state,
mds won't send session msg to client, and delayed_work skip
CEPH_MDS_SESSION_OPENING state session, the session hang forever.

Allow ceph_con_keepalive to reconnect a session in OPENING to avoid
session hang. Also, ensure that we skip sessions in RESTARTING and
REJECTED states since those states can't be resurrected by issuing
a keepalive.
