Subject: [PATCH] genirq/matrix: Exclude managed interrupts in
 irq_matrix_allocated()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.63
Git-commit: a0b0bad10587ae2948a7c36ca4ffc206007fbcf3

[ Upstream commit a0b0bad10587ae2948a7c36ca4ffc206007fbcf3 ]

When a CPU is about to be offlined, x86 validates that all active
interrupts which are targeted to this CPU can be migrated to the remaining
online CPUs. If not, the offline operation is aborted.

The validation uses irq_matrix_allocated() to retrieve the number of
vectors which are allocated on the outgoing CPU. The returned number of
allocated vectors includes also vectors which are associated to managed
interrupts.

That's overaccounting because managed interrupts are:

  - not migrated when the affinity mask of the interrupt targets only
    the outgoing CPU

  - migrated to another CPU, but in that case the vector is already
    pre-allocated on the potential target CPUs and must not be taken into
    account.

As a consequence the check whether the remaining online CPUs have enough
capacity for migrating the allocated vectors from the outgoing CPU might
fail incorrectly.

Let irq_matrix_allocated() return only the number of allocated non-managed
interrupts to make this validation check correct.
