Subject: [PATCH] mm, percpu: do not consider sleepable allocations atomic
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.59
Git-commit: 9a5b183941b52f84c0f9e5f27ce44e99318c9e0f

[ Upstream commit 9a5b183941b52f84c0f9e5f27ce44e99318c9e0f ]

28307d938fb2 ("percpu: make pcpu_alloc() aware of current gfp context")
has fixed a reclaim recursion for scoped GFP_NOFS context.  It has done
that by avoiding taking pcpu_alloc_mutex.  This is a correct solution as
the worker context with full GFP_KERNEL allocation/reclaim power and which
is using the same lock cannot block the NOFS pcpu_alloc caller.

On the other hand this is a very conservative approach that could lead to
failures because pcpu_alloc lockless implementation is quite limited.

We have a bug report about premature failures when scsi array of 193
devices is scanned.  Sometimes (not consistently) the scanning aborts
because the iscsid daemon fails to create the queue for a random scsi
device during the scan.  iscsid itself is running with PR_SET_IO_FLUSHER
set so all allocations from this process context are GFP_NOIO.  This in
turn makes any pcpu_alloc lockless (without pcpu_alloc_mutex) which leads
to pre-mature failures.

It has turned out that iscsid has worked around this by dropping
PR_SET_IO_FLUSHER (https://github.com/open-iscsi/open-iscsi/pull/382) when
scanning host.  But we can do better in this case on the kernel side and
use pcpu_alloc_mutex for NOIO resp.  NOFS constrained allocation scopes
too.  We just need the WQ worker to never trigger IO/FS reclaim.  Achieve
that by enforcing scoped GFP_NOIO for the whole execution of
pcpu_balance_workfn (this will imply NOFS constrain as well).  This will
remove the dependency chain and preserve the full allocation power of the
pcpu_alloc call.

While at it make is_atomic really test for blockable allocations.
