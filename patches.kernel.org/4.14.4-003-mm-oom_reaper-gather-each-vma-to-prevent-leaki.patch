Subject: [PATCH] mm, oom_reaper: gather each vma to prevent leaking TLB entry
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.4
Git-commit: 687cb0884a714ff484d038e9190edc874edcf146

commit 687cb0884a714ff484d038e9190edc874edcf146 upstream.

tlb_gather_mmu(&tlb, mm, 0, -1) means gathering the whole virtual memory
space.  In this case, tlb->fullmm is true.  Some archs like arm64
doesn't flush TLB when tlb->fullmm is true:

  commit 5a7862e83000 ("arm64: tlbflush: avoid flushing when fullmm == 1").

Which causes leaking of tlb entries.

Will clarifies his patch:
 "Basically, we tag each address space with an ASID (PCID on x86) which
  is resident in the TLB. This means we can elide TLB invalidation when
  pulling down a full mm because we won't ever assign that ASID to
  another mm without doing TLB invalidation elsewhere (which actually
  just nukes the whole TLB).

  I think that means that we could potentially not fault on a kernel
  uaccess, because we could hit in the TLB"

There could be a window between complete_signal() sending IPI to other
cores and all threads sharing this mm are really kicked off from cores.
In this window, the oom reaper may calls tlb_flush_mmu_tlbonly() to
flush TLB then frees pages.  However, due to the above problem, the TLB
entries are not really flushed on arm64.  Other threads are possible to
access these pages through TLB entries.  Moreover, a copy_to_user() can
also write to these pages without generating page fault, causes
use-after-free bugs.

This patch gathers each vma instead of gathering full vm space.  In this
case tlb->fullmm is not true.  The behavior of oom reaper become similar
to munmapping before do_exit, which should be safe for all archs.
