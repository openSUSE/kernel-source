Subject: [PATCH] gfs2: read-only mounts should grab the sd_freeze_gl glock
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.10
Git-commit: b780cc615ba4795a7ef0e93b19424828a5ad456a

[ Upstream commit b780cc615ba4795a7ef0e93b19424828a5ad456a ]

Before this patch, only read-write mounts would grab the freeze
glock in read-only mode, as part of gfs2_make_fs_rw. So the freeze
glock was never initialized. That meant requests to freeze, which
request the glock in EX, were granted without any state transition.
That meant you could mount a gfs2 file system, which is currently
frozen on a different cluster node, in read-only mode.

This patch makes read-only mounts lock the freeze glock in SH mode,
which will block for file systems that are frozen on another node.
