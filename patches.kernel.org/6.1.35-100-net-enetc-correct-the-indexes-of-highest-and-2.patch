Subject: [PATCH] net: enetc: correct the indexes of highest and 2nd highest
 TCs
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.35
Git-commit: 21225873be1472b7c59ed3650396af0e40578112

[ Upstream commit 21225873be1472b7c59ed3650396af0e40578112 ]

For ENETC hardware, the TCs are numbered from 0 to N-1, where N
is the number of TCs. Numerically higher TC has higher priority.
It's obvious that the highest priority TC index should be N-1 and
the 2nd highest priority TC index should be N-2.

However, the previous logic uses netdev_get_prio_tc_map() to get
the indexes of highest priority and 2nd highest priority TCs, it
does not make sense and is incorrect to give a "tc" argument to
netdev_get_prio_tc_map(). So the driver may get the wrong indexes
of the two highest priotiry TCs which would lead to failed to set
the CBS for the two highest priotiry TCs.

e.g.
$ tc qdisc add dev eno0 parent root handle 100: mqprio num_tc 6 \
	map 0 0 1 1 2 3 4 5 queues 1@0 1@1 1@2 1@3 2@4 2@6 hw 1
$ tc qdisc replace dev eno0 parent 100:6 cbs idleslope 100000 \
	sendslope -900000 hicredit 12 locredit -113 offload 1
$ Error: Specified device failed to setup cbs hardware offload.
  ^^^^^

In this example, the previous logic deems the indexes of the two
highest priotiry TCs should be 3 and 2. Actually, the indexes are
5 and 4, because the number of TCs is 6. So it would be failed to
configure the CBS for the two highest priority TCs.
