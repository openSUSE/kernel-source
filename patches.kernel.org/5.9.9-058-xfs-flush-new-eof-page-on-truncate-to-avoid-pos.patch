Subject: [PATCH] xfs: flush new eof page on truncate to avoid post-eof
 corruption
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.9
Git-commit: 869ae85dae64b5540e4362d7fe4cd520e10ec05c

[ Upstream commit 869ae85dae64b5540e4362d7fe4cd520e10ec05c ]

It is possible to expose non-zeroed post-EOF data in XFS if the new
EOF page is dirty, backed by an unwritten block and the truncate
happens to race with writeback. iomap_truncate_page() will not zero
the post-EOF portion of the page if the underlying block is
unwritten. The subsequent call to truncate_setsize() will, but
doesn't dirty the page. Therefore, if writeback happens to complete
after iomap_truncate_page() (so it still sees the unwritten block)
but before truncate_setsize(), the cached page becomes inconsistent
with the on-disk block. A mapped read after the associated page is
reclaimed or invalidated exposes non-zero post-EOF data.

For example, consider the following sequence when run on a kernel
modified to explicitly flush the new EOF page within the race
window:

$ xfs_io -fc "falloc 0 4k" -c fsync /mnt/file
$ xfs_io -c "pwrite 0 4k" -c "truncate 1k" /mnt/file
  ...
$ xfs_io -c "mmap 0 4k" -c "mread -v 1k 8" /mnt/file
00000400:  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ........
$ umount /mnt/; mount <dev> /mnt/
$ xfs_io -c "mmap 0 4k" -c "mread -v 1k 8" /mnt/file
00000400:  cd cd cd cd cd cd cd cd  ........

Update xfs_setattr_size() to explicitly flush the new EOF page prior
to the page truncate to ensure iomap has the latest state of the
underlying block.
