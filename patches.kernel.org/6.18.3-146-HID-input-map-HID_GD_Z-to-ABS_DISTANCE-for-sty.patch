Subject: [PATCH] HID: input: map HID_GD_Z to ABS_DISTANCE for stylus/pen
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.3
Git-commit: 7953794f741e94d30df9dafaaa4c031c85b891d6

commit 7953794f741e94d30df9dafaaa4c031c85b891d6 upstream.

HID_GD_Z is mapped to ABS_Z for stylus and pen in hid-input.c. But HID_GD_Z
should be used to report ABS_DISTANCE for stylus and pen as described at:
Documentation/input/event-codes.rst#n226

* ABS_DISTANCE:

  - Used to describe the distance of a tool from an interaction surface. This
    event should only be emitted while the tool is hovering, meaning in close
    proximity of the device and while the value of the BTN_TOUCH code is 0. If
    the input device may be used freely in three dimensions, consider ABS_Z
    instead.
  - BTN_TOOL_<name> should be set to 1 when the tool comes into detectable
    proximity and set to 0 when the tool leaves detectable proximity.
    BTN_TOOL_<name> signals the type of tool that is currently detected by the
    hardware and is otherwise independent of ABS_DISTANCE and/or BTN_TOUCH.

This patch makes the correct mapping. The ABS_DISTANCE is currently not mapped
by any HID usage in hid-generic driver.
