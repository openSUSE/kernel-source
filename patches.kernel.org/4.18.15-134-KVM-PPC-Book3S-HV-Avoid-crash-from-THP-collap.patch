Subject: [PATCH] KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Avoid crash from THP collapse during
 radix page fault
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.15
Git-commit: 6579804c431712d56956a63b1a01509441cc6800

commit 6579804c431712d56956a63b1a01509441cc6800 upstream.

Commit 71d29f43b633 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Don't use compound_order to
determine host mapping size", 2018-09-11) added a call to
__find_linux_pte() and a dereference of the returned PTE pointer to the
radix page fault path in the common case where the page is normal
system memory.  Previously, __find_linux_pte() was only called for
mappings to physical addresses which don't have a page struct (e.g.
memory-mapped I/O) or where the page struct is marked as reserved
memory.

This exposes us to the possibility that the returned PTE pointer
could be NULL, for example in the case of a concurrent THP collapse
operation.  Dereferencing the returned NULL pointer causes a host
crash.

To fix this, we check for NULL, and if it is NULL, we retry the
operation by returning to the guest, with the expectation that it
will generate the same page fault again (unless of course it has
been fixed up by another CPU in the meantime).
