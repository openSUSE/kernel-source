Subject: [PATCH] staging: mt7621-dts: fix pci address for PCI memory range
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.2
Git-commit: 5b4f167ef3555ec4c334a8dc89c1b44bb2c6bff5

[ Upstream commit 5b4f167ef3555ec4c334a8dc89c1b44bb2c6bff5 ]

Driver code call 'devm_of_pci_get_host_bridge_resources'
to get resources and properly fill 'bridge->windows' and
'bridge->dma_ranges'. After parsing the ranges and store
as resources, at the end it makes a call to pci function
'pci_add_resource_offset' to set the offset for the
memory resource. To calculate offset, resource start address
subtracts pci address of the range. MT7621 does not need
any offset for the memory resource. Moreover, setting an
offset got into 'WARN_ON' calls from pci devices driver code.
Until now memory range pci_addr was being '0x00000000' and
res->start is '0x60000000' but becase pci controller driver
was manually setting resources and adding them using pci function
'pci_add_resource' where a zero is passed as offset, things
was properly working. Since PCI_IOBASE is defined now for
ralink we don't set nothing manually anymore so we have to
properly fix PCI address for this range to make things work
and the new pci address must be set to '0x60000000'. Doing
in this way the subtract result obtain zero as offset
and pci device driver code properly works.
