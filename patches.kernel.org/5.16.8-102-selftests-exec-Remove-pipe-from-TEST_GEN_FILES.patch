Subject: [PATCH] selftests/exec: Remove pipe from TEST_GEN_FILES
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.16.8
Git-commit: 908a26e139e8cf21093acc56d8e90ddad2ad1eff

commit 908a26e139e8cf21093acc56d8e90ddad2ad1eff upstream.

pipe named FIFO special file is being created in execveat.c to perform
some tests. Makefile doesn't need to do anything with the pipe. When it
isn't found, Makefile generates the following build error:

make: *** No rule to make target
'../tools/testing/selftests/exec/pipe', needed by 'all'.  Stop.

pipe is created and removed during test run-time.

Amended change log to add pipe remove info:
