Subject: [PATCH] cgroup: Fix dom_cgrp propagation when enabling threaded mode
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.15
Git-commit: 479adb89a97b0a33e5a9d702119872cc82ca21aa

commit 479adb89a97b0a33e5a9d702119872cc82ca21aa upstream.

A cgroup which is already a threaded domain may be converted into a
threaded cgroup if the prerequisite conditions are met.  When this
happens, all threaded descendant should also have their ->dom_cgrp
updated to the new threaded domain cgroup.  Unfortunately, this
propagation was missing leading to the following failure.

  # cd /sys/fs/cgroup/unified
  # cat cgroup.subtree_control    # show that no controllers are enabled

  # mkdir -p mycgrp/a/b/c
  # echo threaded > mycgrp/a/b/cgroup.type

  At this point, the hierarchy looks as follows:

      mycgrp [d]
	  a [dt]
	      b [t]
		  c [inv]

  Now let's make node "a" threaded (and thus "mycgrp" s made "domain threaded"):

  # echo threaded > mycgrp/a/cgroup.type

  By this point, we now have a hierarchy that looks as follows:

      mycgrp [dt]
	  a [t]
	      b [t]
		  c [inv]

  But, when we try to convert the node "c" from "domain invalid" to
  "threaded", we get ENOTSUP on the write():

  # echo threaded > mycgrp/a/b/c/cgroup.type
  sh: echo: write error: Operation not supported

This patch fixes the problem by

* Moving the opencoded ->dom_cgrp save and restoration in
  cgroup_enable_threaded() into cgroup_{save|restore}_control() so
  that mulitple cgroups can be handled.

* Updating all threaded descendants' ->dom_cgrp to point to the new
  dom_cgrp when enabling threaded mode.
