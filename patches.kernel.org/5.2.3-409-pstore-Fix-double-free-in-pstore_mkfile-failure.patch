Subject: [PATCH] pstore: Fix double-free in pstore_mkfile() failure path
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.3
Git-commit: 4c6d80e1144bdf48cae6b602ae30d41f3e5c76a9

commit 4c6d80e1144bdf48cae6b602ae30d41f3e5c76a9 upstream.

The pstore_mkfile() function is passed a pointer to a struct
pstore_record. On success it consumes this 'record' pointer and
references it from the created inode.

On failure, however, it may or may not free the record. There are even
two different code paths which return -ENOMEM -- one of which does and
the other doesn't free the record.

Make the behaviour deterministic by never consuming and freeing the
record when returning failure, allowing the caller to do the cleanup
consistently.
