Subject: [PATCH] usb: dwc3: qcom: add ACPI device id for sc8180x
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.7
Git-commit: 1edbff9c80ed32071fffa7dbaaea507fdb21ff2d

commit 1edbff9c80ed32071fffa7dbaaea507fdb21ff2d upstream.

It enables USB Host support for sc8180x ACPI boot, both the standalone
one and the one behind URS (USB Role Switch).  And they share the
the same dwc3_acpi_pdata with sdm845.
