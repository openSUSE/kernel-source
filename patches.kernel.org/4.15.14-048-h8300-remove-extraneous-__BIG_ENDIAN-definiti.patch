Subject: [PATCH] h8300: remove extraneous __BIG_ENDIAN definition
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.14
Git-commit: 1705f7c534163594f8b05e060cb49fbea86ca70b

commit 1705f7c534163594f8b05e060cb49fbea86ca70b upstream.

A bugfix I did earlier caused a build regression on h8300, which defines
the __BIG_ENDIAN macro in a slightly different way than the generic
code:

  arch/h8300/include/asm/byteorder.h:5:0: warning: "__BIG_ENDIAN" redefined

We don't need to define it here, as the same macro is already provided
by the linux/byteorder/big_endian.h, and that version does not conflict.

While this is a v4.16 regression, my earlier patch also got backported
to the 4.14 and 4.15 stable kernels, so we need the fixup there as well.
