Subject: [PATCH] Revert "gdrom: fix a memory leak bug"
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.7
Git-commit: 257343d3ed557f11d580d0b7c515dc154f64a42b

commit 257343d3ed557f11d580d0b7c515dc154f64a42b upstream.

This reverts commit 093c48213ee37c3c3ff1cf5ac1aa2a9d8bc66017.

Because of recent interactions with developers from @umn.edu, all
commits from them have been recently re-reviewed to ensure if they were
correct or not.

Upon review, this commit was found to be incorrect for the reasons
below, so it must be reverted.  It will be fixed up "correctly" in a
later kernel change.

Because of this, all submissions from this group must be reverted from
the kernel tree and will need to be re-reviewed again to determine if
they actually are a valid fix.  Until that work is complete, remove this
change to ensure that no problems are being introduced into the
codebase.
