Subject: [PATCH] media: vb2: core: Finish buffers at the end of the stream
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.4
Git-commit: 03703ed1debf777ea845aa9b50ba2e80a5e7dd3c

commit 03703ed1debf777ea845aa9b50ba2e80a5e7dd3c upstream.

If buffers were prepared or queued and the buffers were released without
starting the queue, the finish mem op (corresponding to the prepare mem
op) was never called to the buffers.

Before commit a136f59c0a1f there was no need to do this as in such a case
the prepare mem op had not been called yet. Address the problem by
explicitly calling finish mem op when the queue is stopped if the buffer
is in either prepared or queued state.

Fixes: a136f59c0a1f ("[media] vb2: Move buffer cache synchronisation to prepare from queue")
