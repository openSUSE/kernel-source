Subject: [PATCH] NFC: nci: Add some bounds checking in nci_hci_cmd_received()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.10
Git-commit: d7ee81ad09f072eab1681877fc71ec05f9c1ae92

[ Upstream commit d7ee81ad09f072eab1681877fc71ec05f9c1ae92 ]

This is similar to commit 674d9de02aa7 ("NFC: Fix possible memory
corruption when handling SHDLC I-Frame commands").

I'm not totally sure, but I think that commit description may have
overstated the danger.  I was under the impression that this data came
from the firmware?  If you can't trust your networking firmware, then
you're already in trouble.

Anyway, these days we add bounds checking where ever we can and we call
it kernel hardening.  Better safe than sorry.
