Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: aspeed: add missing memory unit-address
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.8
Git-commit: 8ef86955fe59f7912a40d57ae4c6d511f0187b4d

[ Upstream commit 8ef86955fe59f7912a40d57ae4c6d511f0187b4d ]

The base aspeed-g5.dtsi already defines a '/memory@80000000' node, so
'/memory' in the board files create a duplicate node. We're probably
getting lucky that the bootloader fixes up the memory node that the
kernel ends up using. Add the unit-address so it's merged with the base
node.

Found with DT json-schema checks.
