commit 074a1e1167afd82c26f6d03a9a8b997d564bb241 upstream.

The virt_addr_valid() function is meant to return true iff
virt_to_page() will return a valid struct page reference. This is true
iff the address provided is found within the unmapped address range
between PAGE_OFFSET & MAP_BASE, but we don't currently check for that
condition. Instead we simply mask the address to obtain what will be a
physical address if the virtual address is indeed in the desired range,
shift it to form a PFN & then call pfn_valid(). This can incorrectly
return true if called with a virtual address which, after masking,
happens to form a physical address corresponding to a valid PFN.

For example we may vmalloc an address in the kernel mapped region
starting a MAP_BASE & obtain the virtual address:

  addr = 0xc000000000002000

When masked by virt_to_phys(), which uses __pa() & in turn CPHYSADDR(),
we obtain the following (bogus) physical address:

  addr = 0x2000

In a common system with PHYS_OFFSET=0 this will correspond to a valid
struct page which should really be accessed by virtual address
PAGE_OFFSET+0x2000, causing virt_addr_valid() to incorrectly return 1
indicating that the original address corresponds to a struct page.

This is equivalent to the ARM64 change made in commit ca219452c6b8
("arm64: Correctly bounds check virt_addr_valid").

This fixes fallout when hardened usercopy is enabled caused by the
related commit 517e1fbeb65f ("mm/usercopy: Drop extra
is_vmalloc_or_module() check") which removed a check for the vmalloc
range that was present from the introduction of the hardened usercopy
feature.
