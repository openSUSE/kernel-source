Subject: [PATCH] iwlwifi: mvm: clear HW_RESTART_REQUESTED when stopping the
 interface
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.2
Git-commit: 155f7e0441cd121b1e673d465a35e99f4b9b2f0b

[ Upstream commit 155f7e0441cd121b1e673d465a35e99f4b9b2f0b ]

Fix a bug that happens in the following scenario:
1) suspend without WoWLAN
2) mac80211 calls drv_stop because of the suspend
3) __iwl_mvm_mac_stop deallocates the aux station
4) during drv_stop the firmware crashes
5) iwlmvm:
	* sets IWL_MVM_STATUS_HW_RESTART_REQUESTED
	* asks mac80211 to kick the restart flow
6) mac80211 puts the restart worker into a freezable
   queue which means that the worker will not run for now
   since the workqueue is already frozen
7) ...
8) resume
9) mac80211 runs ieee80211_reconfig as part of the resume
10) mac80211 detects that a restart flow has been requested
    and that we are now resuming from suspend and cancels
    the restart worker
11) mac80211 calls drv_start()
12) __iwl_mvm_mac_start checks that IWL_MVM_STATUS_HW_RESTART_REQUESTED
    clears it, sets IWL_MVM_STATUS_IN_HW_RESTART and calls
    iwl_mvm_restart_cleanup()
13) iwl_fw_error_dump gets called and accesses the device
    to get debug data
14) iwl_mvm_up adds the aux station
15) iwl_mvm_add_aux_sta() allocates an internal station for
    the aux station
16) iwl_mvm_allocate_int_sta() tests IWL_MVM_STATUS_IN_HW_RESTART
    and doesn't really allocate a station ID for the aux
    station
17) a new queue is added for the aux station

Note that steps from 5 to 9 aren't really part of the
problem but were described for the sake of completeness.

Once the iwl_mvm_mac_stop() is called, the device is not
accessible, meaning that step 12) can't succeed and we'll
see the following:

drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/pcie/trans.c:2122 iwl_trans_pcie_grab_nic_access+0xc0/0x1d6 [iwlwifi]()
Timeout waiting for hardware access (CSR_GP_CNTRL 0x080403d8)

[<ffffffffc0366c5b>] wiphy_resume+0xa9/0xc6 [cfg80211]

The station id of the aux station is set to 0xff in step 3
and because we don't really allocate a new station id for
the auxliary station (as explained in 16), we end up sending
a command to the firmware asking to connect the queue
to station id 0xff. This makes the firmware crash with the
following information:

0x00002093 | ADVANCED_SYSASSERT
0x000002F0 | trm_hw_status0
0x00000000 | trm_hw_status1
0x00000B38 | branchlink2
0x0001978C | interruptlink1
0x00000000 | interruptlink2
0xFF080501 | data1
0xDEADBEEF | data2
0xDEADBEEF | data3
Firmware error during reconfiguration - reprobe!
FW error in SYNC CMD SCD_QUEUE_CFG

Fix this by clearing IWL_MVM_STATUS_HW_RESTART_REQUESTED
in iwl_mvm_mac_stop(). We won't be able to collect debug
data anyway and when we will brought up again, we will
have a clean state from the firmware perspective.
Since we won't have IWL_MVM_STATUS_IN_HW_RESTART set in
step 12) we won't get to the 2093 ASSERT either.
