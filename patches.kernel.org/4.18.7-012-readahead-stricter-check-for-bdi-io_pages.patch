Subject: [PATCH] readahead: stricter check for bdi io_pages
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.7
Git-commit: dc30b96ab6d569060741572cf30517d3179429a8

commit dc30b96ab6d569060741572cf30517d3179429a8 upstream.

ondemand_readahead() checks bdi->io_pages to cap the maximum pages
that need to be processed. This works until the readit section. If
we would do an async only readahead (async size = sync size) and
target is at beginning of window we expand the pages by another
get_next_ra_size() pages. Btrace for large reads shows that kernel
always issues a doubled size read at the beginning of processing.
Add an additional check for io_pages in the lower part of the func.
The fix helps devices that hard limit bio pages and rely on proper
handling of max_hw_read_sectors (e.g. older FusionIO cards). For
that reason it could qualify for stable.
