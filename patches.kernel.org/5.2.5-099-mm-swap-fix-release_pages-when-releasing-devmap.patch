[ Upstream commit c5d6c45e90c49150670346967971e14576afd7f1 ]

release_pages() is an optimized version of a loop around put_page().
Unfortunately for devmap pages the logic is not entirely correct in
release_pages().  This is because device pages can be more than type
MEMORY_DEVICE_PUBLIC.  There are in fact 4 types, private, public, FS DAX,
and PCI P2PDMA.  Some of these have specific needs to "put" the page while
others do not.

This logic to handle any special needs is contained in
put_devmap_managed_page().  Therefore all devmap pages should be processed
by this function where we can contain the correct logic for a page put.

Handle all device type pages within release_pages() by calling
put_devmap_managed_page() on all devmap pages.  If
put_devmap_managed_page() returns true the page has been put and we
continue with the next page.  A false return of put_devmap_managed_page()
means the page did not require special processing and should fall to
"normal" processing.

This was found via code inspection while determining if release_pages()
and the new put_user_pages() could be interchangeable.[1]
