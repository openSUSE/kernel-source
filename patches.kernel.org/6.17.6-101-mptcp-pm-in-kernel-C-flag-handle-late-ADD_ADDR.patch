Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: pm: in-kernel: C-flag: handle late ADD_ADDR
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.6
Git-commit: e84cb860ac3ce67ec6ecc364433fd5b412c448bc

commit e84cb860ac3ce67ec6ecc364433fd5b412c448bc upstream.

The special C-flag case expects the ADD_ADDR to be received when
switching to 'fully-established'. But for various reasons, the ADD_ADDR
could be sent after the "4th ACK", and the special case doesn't work.

On NIPA, the new test validating this special case for the C-flag failed
a few times, e.g.

  102 default limits, server deny join id 0
        syn rx                 [FAIL] got 0 JOIN[s] syn rx expected 2

  Server ns stats
  (...)
  MPTcpExtAddAddrTx  1
  MPTcpExtEchoAdd    1

  Client ns stats
  (...)
  MPTcpExtAddAddr    1
  MPTcpExtEchoAddTx  1

        synack rx              [FAIL] got 0 JOIN[s] synack rx expected 2
        ack rx                 [FAIL] got 0 JOIN[s] ack rx expected 2
        join Rx                [FAIL] see above
        syn tx                 [FAIL] got 0 JOIN[s] syn tx expected 2
        join Tx                [FAIL] see above

I had a suspicion about what the issue could be: the ADD_ADDR might have
been received after the switch to the 'fully-established' state. The
issue was not easy to reproduce. The packet capture shown that the
ADD_ADDR can indeed be sent with a delay, and the client would not try
to establish subflows to it as expected.

A simple fix is not to mark the endpoints as 'used' in the C-flag case,
when looking at creating subflows to the remote initial IP address and
port. In this case, there is no need to try.

Note: newly added fullmesh endpoints will still continue to be used as
expected, thanks to the conditions behind mptcp_pm_add_addr_c_flag_case.
