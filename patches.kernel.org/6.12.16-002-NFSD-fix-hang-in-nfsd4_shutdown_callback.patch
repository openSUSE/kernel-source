Subject: [PATCH] NFSD: fix hang in nfsd4_shutdown_callback
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.16
Git-commit: 036ac2778f7b28885814c6fbc07e156ad1624d03

commit 036ac2778f7b28885814c6fbc07e156ad1624d03 upstream.

If nfs4_client is in courtesy state then there is no point to send
the callback. This causes nfsd4_shutdown_callback to hang since
cl_cb_inflight is not 0. This hang lasts about 15 minutes until TCP
notifies NFSD that the connection was dropped.

This patch modifies nfsd4_run_cb_work to skip the RPC call if
nfs4_client is in courtesy state.
