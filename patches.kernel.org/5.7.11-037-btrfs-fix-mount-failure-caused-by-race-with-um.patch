Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: fix mount failure caused by race with umount
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.11
Git-commit: 48cfa61b58a1fee0bc49eef04f8ccf31493b7cdd

commit 48cfa61b58a1fee0bc49eef04f8ccf31493b7cdd upstream.

It is possible to cause a btrfs mount to fail by racing it with a slow
umount. The crux of the sequence is generic_shutdown_super not yet
calling sop->put_super before btrfs_mount_root calls btrfs_open_devices.
If that occurs, btrfs_open_devices will decide the opened counter is
non-zero, increment it, and skip resetting fs_devices->total_rw_bytes to
0. From here, mount will call sget which will result in grab_super
trying to take the super block umount semaphore. That semaphore will be
held by the slow umount, so mount will block. Before up-ing the
semaphore, umount will delete the super block, resulting in mount's sget
reliably allocating a new one, which causes the mount path to dutifully
fill it out, and increment total_rw_bytes a second time, which causes
the mount to fail, as we see double the expected bytes.

Here is the sequence laid out in greater detail:

CPU0                                                    CPU1
down_write sb->s_umount
btrfs_kill_super
  kill_anon_super(sb)
    generic_shutdown_super(sb);
      shrink_dcache_for_umount(sb);
      sync_filesystem(sb);
      evict_inodes(sb); // SLOW

                                              btrfs_mount_root
                                                btrfs_scan_one_device
                                                fs_devices = device->fs_devices
                                                fs_info->fs_devices = fs_devices
                                                // fs_devices-opened makes this a no-op
                                                btrfs_open_devices(fs_devices, mode, fs_type)
                                                s = sget(fs_type, test, set, flags, fs_info);
                                                  find sb in s_instances
                                                  grab_super(sb);
                                                    down_write(&s->s_umount); // blocks

      sop->put_super(sb)
        // sb->fs_devices->opened == 2; no-op
      spin_lock(&sb_lock);
      hlist_del_init(&sb->s_instances);
      spin_unlock(&sb_lock);
      up_write(&sb->s_umount);
                                                    return 0;
                                                  retry lookup
                                                  don't find sb in s_instances (deleted by CPU0)
                                                  s = alloc_super
                                                  return s;
                                                btrfs_fill_super(s, fs_devices, data)
                                                  open_ctree // fs_devices total_rw_bytes improperly set!
                                                    btrfs_read_chunk_tree
                                                      read_one_dev // increment total_rw_bytes again!!
                                                      super_total_bytes < fs_devices->total_rw_bytes // ERROR!!!

To fix this, we clear total_rw_bytes from within btrfs_read_chunk_tree
before the calls to read_one_dev, while holding the sb umount semaphore
and the uuid mutex.

To reproduce, it is sufficient to dirty a decent number of inodes, then
quickly umount and mount.

  for i in $(seq 0 500)
  do
    dd if=/dev/zero of="/mnt/foo/$i" bs=1M count=1
  done
  umount /mnt/foo&
  mount /mnt/foo

does the trick for me.
