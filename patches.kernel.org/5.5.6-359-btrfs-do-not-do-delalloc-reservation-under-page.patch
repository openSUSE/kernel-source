Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: do not do delalloc reservation under page lock

[ Upstream commit f4b1363cae43fef7c86c993b7ca7fe7d546b3c68 ]

We ran into a deadlock in production with the fixup worker.  The stack
traces were as follows:

Thankfully the stars have to align just right to hit this.  First you
have to end up in the fixup worker, which is tricky by itself (my
reproducer does DIO reads into a MMAP'ed region, so not a common
operation).  Then you have to have less than a page size of free data
space and 0 unallocated space so you go down the "commit the transaction
to free up pinned space" path.  This was accomplished by a random
balance that was running on the host.  Then you get this deadlock.

I'm still in the process of trying to force the deadlock to happen on
demand, but I've hit other issues.  I can still trigger the fixup worker
path itself so this patch has been tested in that regard, so the normal
case is fine.
