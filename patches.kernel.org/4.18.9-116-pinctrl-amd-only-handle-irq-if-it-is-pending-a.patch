Subject: [PATCH] pinctrl/amd: only handle irq if it is pending and unmasked
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.9
Git-commit: 8bbed1eef001fdfc0ee9595f64cc4f769d265af4

[ Upstream commit 8bbed1eef001fdfc0ee9595f64cc4f769d265af4 ]

The AMD pinctrl driver demultiplexes GPIO interrupts and fires off their
individual handlers.

If one of these GPIO irqs is configured as a level interrupt, and its
downstream handler is a threaded ONESHOT interrupt, the GPIO interrupt
source is masked by handle_level_irq() until the eventual return of the
threaded irq handler.  During this time the level GPIO interrupt status
will still report as high until the actual gpio source is cleared - both
in the individual GPIO interrupt status bit (INTERRUPT_STS_OFF) and in
its corresponding "WAKE_INT_STATUS_REG" bit.

Thus, if another GPIO interrupt occurs during this time,
amd_gpio_irq_handler() will see that the (masked-and-not-yet-cleared)
level irq is still pending and incorrectly call its handler again.

To fix this, have amd_gpio_irq_handler() check for both interrupts status
and mask before calling generic_handle_irq().

Note: Is it possible that this bug was the source of the interrupt storm
on Ryzen when using chained interrupts before commit ba714a9c1dea85
("pinctrl/amd: Use regular interrupt instead of chained")?
