Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: qrb2210-rb1: Fix UART3 wakeup IRQ storm
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.2
Git-commit: 9c92d36b0b1ea8b2a19dbe0416434f3491dbfaaf

[ Upstream commit 9c92d36b0b1ea8b2a19dbe0416434f3491dbfaaf ]

For BT use cases, pins are configured with pull-up state in sleep state
to avoid noise. If IRQ type is configured as level high and the GPIO line
is also in a high state, it causes continuous interrupt assertions leading
to an IRQ storm when wakeup irq enables at system suspend/runtime suspend.

Switching to edge-triggered interrupt (IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING) resolves
this by only triggering on state transitions (high-to-low) rather than
maintaining sensitivity to the static level state, effectively preventing
the continuous interrupt condition and eliminating the wakeup IRQ storm.

Fixes: 9380e0a1d449 ("arm64: dts: qcom: qrb2210-rb1: add Bluetooth support")
