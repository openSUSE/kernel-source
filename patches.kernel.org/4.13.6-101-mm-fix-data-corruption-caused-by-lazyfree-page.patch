Subject: [PATCH] mm: fix data corruption caused by lazyfree page
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.13.6
Git-commit: 9625456cc76391b7f3f2809579126542a8ed4d39

commit 9625456cc76391b7f3f2809579126542a8ed4d39 upstream.

MADV_FREE clears pte dirty bit and then marks the page lazyfree (clear
SwapBacked).  There is no lock to prevent the page is added to swap
cache between these two steps by page reclaim.  If page reclaim finds
such page, it will simply add the page to swap cache without pageout the
page to swap because the page is marked as clean.  Next time, page fault
will read data from the swap slot which doesn't have the original data,
so we have a data corruption.  To fix issue, we mark the page dirty and
pageout the page.

However, we shouldn't dirty all pages which is clean and in swap cache.
swapin page is swap cache and clean too.  So we only dirty page which is
added into swap cache in page reclaim, which shouldn't be swapin page.
As Minchan suggested, simply dirty the page in add_to_swap can do the
job.
