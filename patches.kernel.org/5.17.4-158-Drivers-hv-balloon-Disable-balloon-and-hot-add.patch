Subject: [PATCH] Drivers: hv: balloon: Disable balloon and hot-add accordingly
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.4
Git-commit: be5802795cf8d0b881745fa9ba7790293b382280

[ Upstream commit be5802795cf8d0b881745fa9ba7790293b382280 ]

Currently there are known potential issues for balloon and hot-add on
ARM64:

*	Unballoon requests from Hyper-V should only unballoon ranges
	that are guest page size aligned, otherwise guests cannot handle
	because it's impossible to partially free a page. This is a
	problem when guest page size > 4096 bytes.

*	Memory hot-add requests from Hyper-V should provide the NUMA
	node id of the added ranges or ARM64 should have a functional
	memory_add_physaddr_to_nid(), otherwise the node id is missing
	for add_memory().

These issues require discussions on design and implementation. In the
meanwhile, post_status() is working and essential to guest monitoring.
Therefore instead of disabling the entire hv_balloon driver, the
ballooning (when page size > 4096 bytes) and hot-add are disabled
accordingly for now. Once the issues are fixed, they can be re-enable in
these cases.
