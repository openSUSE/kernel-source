Subject: [PATCH] drm/nouveau: tegra: Detach from ARM DMA/IOMMU mapping
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.10
Git-commit: b59fb482b52269977ee5de205308e5b236a03917

[ Upstream commit b59fb482b52269977ee5de205308e5b236a03917 ]

Depending on the kernel configuration, early ARM architecture setup code
may have attached the GPU to a DMA/IOMMU mapping that transparently uses
the IOMMU to back the DMA API. Tegra requires special handling for IOMMU
backed buffers (a special bit in the GPU's MMU page tables indicates the
memory path to take: via the SMMU or directly to the memory controller).
Transparently backing DMA memory with an IOMMU prevents Nouveau from
properly handling such memory accesses and causes memory access faults.

As a side-note: buffers other than those allocated in instance memory
don't need to be physically contiguous from the GPU's perspective since
the GPU can map them into contiguous buffers using its own MMU. Mapping
these buffers through the IOMMU is unnecessary and will even lead to
performance degradation because of the additional translation. One
exception to this are compressible buffers which need large pages. In
order to enable these large pages, multiple small pages will have to be
combined into one large (I/O virtually contiguous) mapping via the
IOMMU. However, that is a topic outside the scope of this fix and isn't
currently supported. An implementation will want to explicitly create
these large pages in the Nouveau driver, so detaching from a DMA/IOMMU
mapping would still be required.
