Subject: [PATCH] md: raid0: account for split bio in iostat accounting
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.53
Git-commit: cc22b5407e9ca76adb7efeed843146510b1b72a5

[ Upstream commit cc22b5407e9ca76adb7efeed843146510b1b72a5 ]

When a bio is split by md raid0, the newly created bio will not be tracked
by md for I/O accounting. Only the portion of I/O still assigned to the
original bio which was reduced by the split will be accounted for. This
results in md iostat data sometimes showing I/O values far below the actual
amount of data being sent through md.

md_account_bio() needs to be called for all bio generated by the bio split.

A simple example of the issue was generated using a raid0 device on partitions
to the same device. Since all raid0 I/O then goes to one device, it makes it
easy to see a gap between the md device and its sd storage. Reading an lvm
device on top of the md device, the iostat output (some 0 columns and extra
devices removed to make the data more compact) was:

I/O was generated doing large direct I/O reads (12M) with dd to a linear
lvm volume on top of the 4 leg raid0 device.

The md2 reads were showing as roughly 2/3 of the reads to the sde device
containing all of md2's raid partitions. The sum of reads to sde was
1826816 kB, which was the expected amount as it was the amount read by
dd. With the patch, the total reads from md will match the reads from
sde and be consistent with the amount of I/O generated.
