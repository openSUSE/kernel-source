Subject: [PATCH] mm/z3fold.c: reinitialize zhdr structs after migration
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.7
Git-commit: c92d2f38563db20c20c8db2f98fa1349290477d5

[ Upstream commit c92d2f38563db20c20c8db2f98fa1349290477d5 ]

z3fold_page_migration() calls memcpy(new_zhdr, zhdr, PAGE_SIZE).
However, zhdr contains fields that can't be directly coppied over (ex:
list_head, a circular linked list).  We only need to initialize the
linked lists in new_zhdr, as z3fold_isolate_page() already ensures that
these lists are empty

Additionally it is possible that zhdr->work has been placed in a
workqueue.  In this case we shouldn't migrate the page, as zhdr->work
references zhdr as opposed to new_zhdr.
