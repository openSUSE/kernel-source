Subject: [PATCH] x86/mce: Make sure logged MCEs are processed after sysfs
 update
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.21
Git-commit: 4783b9cb374af02d49740e00e2da19fd4ed6dec4

commit 4783b9cb374af02d49740e00e2da19fd4ed6dec4 upstream.

A recent change introduced a flag to queue up errors found during
boot-time polling. These errors will be processed during late init once
the MCE subsystem is fully set up.

A number of sysfs updates call mce_restart() which goes through a subset
of the CPU init flow. This includes polling MCA banks and logging any
errors found. Since the same function is used as boot-time polling,
errors will be queued. However, the system is now past late init, so the
errors will remain queued until another error is found and the workqueue
is triggered.

Call mce_schedule_work() at the end of mce_restart() so that queued
errors are processed.
