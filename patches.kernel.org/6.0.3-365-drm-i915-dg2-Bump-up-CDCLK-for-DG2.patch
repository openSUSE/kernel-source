Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915/dg2: Bump up CDCLK for DG2
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.3
Git-commit: 859161b952a453b86362f168fadef72a8ba31a05

[ Upstream commit 859161b952a453b86362f168fadef72a8ba31a05 ]

We seem to need this W/A same way as for TGL, in order
to fix some of the underruns, which we currently have and
those not related to PSR.
