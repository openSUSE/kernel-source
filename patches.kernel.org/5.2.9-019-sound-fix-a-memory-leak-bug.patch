Subject: [PATCH] sound: fix a memory leak bug
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.9
Git-commit: c7cd7c748a3250ca33509f9235efab9c803aca09

commit c7cd7c748a3250ca33509f9235efab9c803aca09 upstream.

In sound_insert_unit(), the controlling structure 's' is allocated through
kmalloc(). Then it is added to the sound driver list by invoking
__sound_insert_unit(). Later on, if __register_chrdev() fails, 's' is
removed from the list through __sound_remove_unit(). If 'index' is not less
than 0, -EBUSY is returned to indicate the error. However, 's' is not
deallocated on this execution path, leading to a memory leak bug.

To fix the above issue, free 's' before -EBUSY is returned.
