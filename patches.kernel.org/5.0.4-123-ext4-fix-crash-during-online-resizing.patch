Subject: [PATCH] ext4: fix crash during online resizing
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.4
Git-commit: f96c3ac8dfc24b4e38fc4c2eba5fea2107b929d1

commit f96c3ac8dfc24b4e38fc4c2eba5fea2107b929d1 upstream.

When computing maximum size of filesystem possible with given number of
group descriptor blocks, we forget to include s_first_data_block into
the number of blocks. Thus for filesystems with non-zero
s_first_data_block it can happen that computed maximum filesystem size
is actually lower than current filesystem size which confuses the code
and eventually leads to a BUG_ON in ext4_alloc_group_tables() hitting on
flex_gd->count == 0. The problem can be reproduced like:

truncate -s 100g /tmp/image
mkfs.ext4 -b 1024 -E resize=262144 /tmp/image 32768
mount -t ext4 -o loop /tmp/image /mnt
resize2fs /dev/loop0 262145
resize2fs /dev/loop0 300000

Fix the problem by properly including s_first_data_block into the
computed number of filesystem blocks.
