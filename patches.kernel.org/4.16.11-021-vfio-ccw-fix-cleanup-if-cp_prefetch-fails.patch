Subject: [PATCH] vfio: ccw: fix cleanup if cp_prefetch fails
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.11
Git-commit: d66a7355717ec903d455277a550d930ba13df4a8

commit d66a7355717ec903d455277a550d930ba13df4a8 upstream.

If the translation of a channel program fails, we may end up attempting
to clean up (free, unpin) stuff that never got translated (and allocated,
pinned) in the first place.

By adjusting the lengths of the chains accordingly (so the element that
failed, and all subsequent elements are excluded) cleanup activities
based on false assumptions can be avoided.

Let's make sure cp_free works properly after cp_prefetch returns with an
error by setting ch_len of a ccw chain to the number of the translated
CCWs on that chain.
