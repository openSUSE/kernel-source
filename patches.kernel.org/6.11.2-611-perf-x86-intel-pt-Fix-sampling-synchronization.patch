Subject: [PATCH] perf/x86/intel/pt: Fix sampling synchronization
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.2
Git-commit: d92792a4b26e50b96ab734cbe203d8a4c932a7a9

commit d92792a4b26e50b96ab734cbe203d8a4c932a7a9 upstream.

pt_event_snapshot_aux() uses pt->handle_nmi to determine if tracing
needs to be stopped, however tracing can still be going because
pt->handle_nmi is set to zero before tracing is stopped in pt_event_stop,
whereas pt_event_snapshot_aux() requires that tracing must be stopped in
order to copy a sample of trace from the buffer.

Instead call pt_config_stop() always, which anyway checks config for
RTIT_CTL_TRACEEN and does nothing if it is already clear.

Note pt_event_snapshot_aux() can continue to use pt->handle_nmi to
determine if the trace needs to be restarted afterwards.
