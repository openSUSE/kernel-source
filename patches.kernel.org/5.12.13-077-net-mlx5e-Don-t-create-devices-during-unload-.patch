Subject: [PATCH] net/mlx5e: Don't create devices during unload flow
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.13
Git-commit: a5ae8fc9058e37437c8c1f82b3d412b4abd1b9e6

[ Upstream commit a5ae8fc9058e37437c8c1f82b3d412b4abd1b9e6 ]

Running devlink reload command for port in switchdev mode cause
resources to corrupt: driver can't release allocated EQ and reclaim
memory pages, because "rdma" auxiliary device had add CQs which blocks
EQ from deletion.
Erroneous sequence happens during reload-down phase, and is following:

1. detach device - suspends auxiliary devices which support it, destroys
   others. During this step "eth-rep" and "rdma-rep" are destroyed,
   "eth" - suspended.
2. disable SRIOV - moves device to legacy mode; as part of disablement -
   rescans drivers. This step adds "rdma" auxiliary device.
3. destroy EQ table - <failure>.

Driver shouldn't create any device during unload flows. To handle that
implement MLX5_PRIV_FLAGS_DETACH flag, set it on device detach and unset
on device attach. If flag is set do no-op on drivers rescan.
