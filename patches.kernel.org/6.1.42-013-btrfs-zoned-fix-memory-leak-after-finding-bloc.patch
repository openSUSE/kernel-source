Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: zoned: fix memory leak after finding block group with
 super blocks
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.42
Git-commit: f1a07c2b4e2c473ec322b8b9ece071b8c88a3512

commit f1a07c2b4e2c473ec322b8b9ece071b8c88a3512 upstream.

At exclude_super_stripes(), if we happen to find a block group that has
super blocks mapped to it and we are on a zoned filesystem, we error out
as this is not supposed to happen, indicating either a bug or maybe some
memory corruption for example. However we are exiting the function without
freeing the memory allocated for the logical address of the super blocks.
Fix this by freeing the logical address.

Fixes: 12659251ca5d ("btrfs: implement log-structured superblock for ZONED mode")
