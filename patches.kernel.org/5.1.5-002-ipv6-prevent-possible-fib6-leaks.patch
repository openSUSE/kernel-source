Subject: [PATCH] ipv6: prevent possible fib6 leaks
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.5
Git-commit: 61fb0d01680771f72cc9d39783fb2c122aaad51e

[ Upstream commit 61fb0d01680771f72cc9d39783fb2c122aaad51e ]

At ipv6 route dismantle, fib6_drop_pcpu_from() is responsible
for finding all percpu routes and set their ->from pointer
to NULL, so that fib6_ref can reach its expected value (1).

The problem right now is that other cpus can still catch the
route being deleted, since there is no rcu grace period
between the route deletion and call to fib6_drop_pcpu_from()

This can leak the fib6 and associated resources, since no
notifier will take care of removing the last reference(s).

I decided to add another boolean (fib6_destroying) instead
of reusing/renaming exception_bucket_flushed to ease stable backports,
and properly document the memory barriers used to implement this fix.

This patch has been co-developped with Wei Wang.
