Subject: [PATCH] usb: dwc3: gadget: Disable CSP for stream OUT ep
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.8
Git-commit: 244add8ebfb231c39db9e33b204bd0ce8f24f782

[ Upstream commit 244add8ebfb231c39db9e33b204bd0ce8f24f782 ]

In stream mode, when fast-forwarding TRBs, the stream number
is not cleared causing the new stream to not get assigned. So
we don't want controller to carry on transfers when short packet
is received. So disable the CSP for stream capable endpoint.

This is based on the 3.30a Programming guide, where table 3-1
device descriptor structure field definitions says for CSP bit
If this bit is 0, the controller generates an XferComplete event
and remove the stream. So if we keep CSP as 1 then switching between
streams would not happen as in stream mode, when fast-forwarding
TRBs, the stream number is not cleared causing the new stream to not get
assigned.
