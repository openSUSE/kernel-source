Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: rockchip: i2s: fix playback after runtime resume
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.4
Git-commit: c66234cfedfc3e6e3b62563a5f2c1562be09a35d

commit c66234cfedfc3e6e3b62563a5f2c1562be09a35d upstream.

When restoring registers during runtime resume, we must not write to
I2S_TXDR which is the transmit FIFO as this queues up a sample to be
output and pushes all of the output channels down by one.

This can be demonstrated with the speaker-test utility:

	for i in a b c; do speaker-test -c 2 -s 1; done

which should play a test through the left speaker three times but if the
I2S hardware starts runtime suspended the first sample will be played
through the right speaker.

Fix this by marking I2S_TXDR as volatile (which also requires marking it
as readble, even though it technically isn't).  This seems to be the
most robust fix, the alternative of giving I2S_TXDR a default value is
more fragile since it does not prevent regcache writing to the register
in all circumstances.

While here, also fix the configuration of I2S_RXDR and I2S_FIFOLR; these
are not writable so they do not suffer from the same problem as I2S_TXDR
but reading from I2S_RXDR does suffer from a similar problem.
