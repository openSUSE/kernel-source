Subject: [PATCH] platform/chrome: cros_ec_proto: check for NULL transfer
 function
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.10
Git-commit: 94d4e7af14a1170e34cf082d92e4c02de9e9fb88

[ Upstream commit 94d4e7af14a1170e34cf082d92e4c02de9e9fb88 ]

As new transfer mechanisms are added to the EC codebase, they may
not support v2 of the EC protocol.

If the v3 initial handshake transfer fails, the kernel will try
and call cmd_xfer as a fallback. If v2 is not supported, cmd_xfer
will be NULL, and the code will end up causing a kernel panic.

Add a check for NULL before calling the transfer function, along
with a helpful comment explaining how one might end up in this
situation.
