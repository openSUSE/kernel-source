Subject: [PATCH] ext4: avoid s_mb_prefetch to be zero in individual scenarios
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.5
Git-commit: 82ef1370b0c1757ab4ce29f34c52b4e93839b0aa

[ Upstream commit 82ef1370b0c1757ab4ce29f34c52b4e93839b0aa ]

Commit cfd732377221 ("ext4: add prefetching for block allocation
bitmaps") introduced block bitmap prefetch, and expects to read block
bitmaps of flex_bg through an IO.  However, it seems to ignore the
value range of s_log_groups_per_flex.  In the scenario where the value
of s_log_groups_per_flex is greater than 27, s_mb_prefetch or
s_mb_prefetch_limit will overflow, cause a divide zero exception.

In addition, the logic of calculating nr is also flawed, because the
size of flexbg is fixed during a single mount, but s_mb_prefetch can
be modified, which causes nr to fail to meet the value condition of
[1, flexbg_size].

To solve this problem, we need to set the upper limit of
s_mb_prefetch.  Since we expect to load block bitmaps of a flex_bg
through an IO, we can consider determining a reasonable upper limit
among the IO limit parameters.  After consideration, we chose
BLK_MAX_SEGMENT_SIZE.  This is a good choice to solve divide zero
problem and avoiding performance degradation.
