Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: delete unused BGs while reclaiming BGs
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.39
Git-commit: 3ed01616bad6c7e3de196676b542ae3df8058592

commit 3ed01616bad6c7e3de196676b542ae3df8058592 upstream.

The reclaiming process only starts after the filesystem volumes are
allocated to a certain level (75% by default). Thus, the list of
reclaiming target block groups can build up so huge at the time the
reclaim process kicks in. On a test run, there were over 1000 BGs in the
reclaim list.

As the reclaim involves rewriting the data, it takes really long time to
reclaim the BGs. While the reclaim is running, btrfs_delete_unused_bgs()
won't proceed because the reclaim side is holding
fs_info->reclaim_bgs_lock. As a result, we will have a large number of
unused BGs kept in the unused list. On my test run, I got 1057 unused BGs.

Since deleting a block group is relatively easy and fast work, we can call
btrfs_delete_unused_bgs() while it reclaims BGs, to avoid building up
unused BGs.
