Subject: [PATCH] sched/fair: Block delayed tasks on throttled hierarchy during
 dequeue
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.6
Git-commit: 514784d00832d23a6a7953ed3694306e5af87b03

Dequeuing a fair task on a throttled hierarchy returns early on
encountering a throttled cfs_rq since the throttle path has already
dequeued the hierarchy above and has adjusted the h_nr_* accounting till
the root cfs_rq.

dequeue_entities() crucially misses calling __block_task() for delayed
tasks being dequeued on the throttled hierarchies, but this was mostly
harmless until commit b7ca5743a260 ("sched/core: Tweak
wait_task_inactive() to force dequeue sched_delayed tasks") since all
existing cases would re-enqueue the task if task_on_rq_queued() returned
true and the task would eventually be blocked at pick after the
hierarchy was unthrottled.

wait_task_inactive() is special as it expects the delayed task on
throttled hierarchy to reach the blocked state on dequeue but since
__block_task() is never called, task_on_rq_queued() continues to return
true. Furthermore, since the task is now off the hierarchy, the pick
never reaches it to fully block the task even after unthrottle leading
to wait_task_inactive() looping endlessly.

Remedy this by calling __block_task() if a delayed task is being
dequeued on a throttled hierarchy.

This fix is only required for stabled kernels implementing delay dequeue
(>= v6.12) before v6.18 since upstream commit e1fad12dcb66 ("sched/fair:
Switch to task based throttle model") indirectly fixes this by removing
the early return conditions in dequeue_entities() as part of the per-task
throttle feature.
