Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: mark requests for GuC virtual engines to avoid
 use-after-free
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.54
Git-commit: 5eefc5307c983b59344a4cb89009819f580c84fa

[ Upstream commit 5eefc5307c983b59344a4cb89009819f580c84fa ]

References to i915_requests may be trapped by userspace inside a
sync_file or dmabuf (dma-resv) and held indefinitely across different
proceses. To counter-act the memory leaks, we try to not to keep
references from the request past their completion.
On the other side on fence release we need to know if rq->engine
is valid and points to hw engine (true for non-virtual requests).
To make it possible extra bit has been added to rq->execution_mask,
for marking virtual engines.
