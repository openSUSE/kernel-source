Subject: [PATCH] bcache: use (REQ_META|REQ_PRIO) to indicate bio for metadata
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.4
Git-commit: dc7292a5bcb4c878b076fca2ac3fc22f81b8f8df

commit dc7292a5bcb4c878b076fca2ac3fc22f81b8f8df upstream.

In 'commit 752f66a75aba ("bcache: use REQ_PRIO to indicate bio for
metadata")' REQ_META is replaced by REQ_PRIO to indicate metadata bio.
This assumption is not always correct, e.g. XFS uses REQ_META to mark
metadata bio other than REQ_PRIO. This is why Nix noticed that bcache
does not cache metadata for XFS after the above commit.

Thanks to Dave Chinner, he explains the difference between REQ_META and
REQ_PRIO from view of file system developer. Here I quote part of his
explanation from mailing list,
   REQ_META is used for metadata. REQ_PRIO is used to communicate to
   the lower layers that the submitter considers this IO to be more
   important that non REQ_PRIO IO and so dispatch should be expedited.

   IOWs, if the filesystem considers metadata IO to be more important
   that user data IO, then it will use REQ_PRIO | REQ_META rather than
   just REQ_META.

Then it seems bios with REQ_META or REQ_PRIO should both be cached for
performance optimation, because they are all probably low I/O latency
demand by upper layer (e.g. file system).

So in this patch, when we want to decide whether to bypass the cache,
REQ_META and REQ_PRIO are both checked. Then both metadata and
high priority I/O requests will be handled properly.
