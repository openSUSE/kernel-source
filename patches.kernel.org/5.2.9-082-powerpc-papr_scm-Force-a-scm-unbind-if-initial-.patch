Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/papr_scm: Force a scm-unbind if initial scm-bind
 fails
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.9
Git-commit: 3a855b7ac7d5021674aa3e1cc9d3bfd6b604e9c0

[ Upstream commit 3a855b7ac7d5021674aa3e1cc9d3bfd6b604e9c0 ]

In some cases initial bind of scm memory for an lpar can fail if
previously it wasn't released using a scm-unbind hcall. This situation
can arise due to panic of the previous kernel or forced lpar
fadump. In such cases the H_SCM_BIND_MEM return a H_OVERLAP error.

To mitigate such cases the patch updates papr_scm_probe() to force a
call to drc_pmem_unbind() in case the initial bind of scm memory fails
with EBUSY error. In case scm-bind operation again fails after the
forced scm-unbind then we follow the existing error path. We also
update drc_pmem_bind() to handle the H_OVERLAP error returned by phyp
and indicate it as a EBUSY error back to the caller.
