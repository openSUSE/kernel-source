Subject: [PATCH] cifs: Remove intermediate object of failed create SFU call

commit 25f6184e24b3991eae977a29ecf27d537cc930b2 upstream.

Check if the server honored ATTR_SYSTEM flag by CREATE_OPTION_SPECIAL
option. If not then server does not support ATTR_SYSTEM and newly
created file is not SFU compatible, which means that the call failed.

If CREATE was successful but either setting ATTR_SYSTEM failed or
writing type/data information failed then remove the intermediate
object created by CREATE. Otherwise intermediate empty object stay
on the server.

This ensures that if the creating of SFU files with system attribute is
unsupported by the server then no empty file stay on the server as a result
of unsupported operation.

This is for example case with Samba server and Linux tmpfs storage without
enabled xattr support (where Samba stores ATTR_SYSTEM bit).
