Subject: [PATCH] block: mq-deadline: Fix write completion handling
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.2
Git-commit: 7211aef86f79583e59b88a0aba0bc830566f7e8e

commit 7211aef86f79583e59b88a0aba0bc830566f7e8e upstream.

For a zoned block device using mq-deadline, if a write request for a
zone is received while another write was already dispatched for the same
zone, dd_dispatch_request() will return NULL and the newly inserted
write request is kept in the scheduler queue waiting for the ongoing
zone write to complete. With this behavior, when no other request has
been dispatched, rq_list in blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests() is empty
and blk_mq_sched_mark_restart_hctx() not called. This in turn leads to
__blk_mq_free_request() call of blk_mq_sched_restart() to not run the
queue when the already dispatched write request completes. The newly
dispatched request stays stuck in the scheduler queue until eventually
another request is submitted.

This problem does not affect SCSI disk as the SCSI stack handles queue
restart on request completion. However, this problem is can be triggered
the nullblk driver with zoned mode enabled.

Fix this by always requesting a queue restart in dd_dispatch_request()
if no request was dispatched while WRITE requests are queued.
