Subject: [PATCH] usb: Increase quirk delay for USB devices
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.13.6
Git-commit: b2a542bbb3081dbd64acc8929c140d196664c406

commit b2a542bbb3081dbd64acc8929c140d196664c406 upstream.

Commit e0429362ab15
("usb: Add device quirk for Logitech HD Pro Webcams C920 and C930e")
introduced quirk to workaround an issue with some Logitech webcams.

The workaround is introducing delay for some USB operations.

According to our testing, delay introduced by original commit
is not long enough and in rare cases we still see issues described
by the aforementioned commit.

This patch increases delays introduced by original commit.
Having this patch applied we do not see those problems anymore.
