Subject: [PATCH] tty: protect tty_write from odd low-level tty disciplines
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.1
Git-commit: 3342ff2698e9720f4040cc458a2744b2b32f5c3a

commit 3342ff2698e9720f4040cc458a2744b2b32f5c3a upstream.

Al root-caused a new warning from syzbot to the ttyprintk tty driver
returning a write count larger than the data the tty layer actually gave
it.  Which confused the tty write code mightily, and with the new
iov_iter based code, caused a WARNING in iov_iter_revert().

syzbot correctly bisected the source of the new warning to commit
9bb48c82aced ("tty: implement write_iter"), but the oddity goes back
much further, it just didn't get caught by anything before.
