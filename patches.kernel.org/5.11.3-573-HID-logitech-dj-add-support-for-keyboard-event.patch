commit ef07c116d98772952807492bd32a61f5af172a94 upstream.

In e400071a805d6229223a98899e9da8c6233704a1 I added support for the
receiver that comes with the G602 device, but unfortunately I screwed up
during testing and it seems the keyboard events were actually not being
sent to userspace.
This resulted in keyboard events being broken in userspace, please
backport the fix.

The receiver uses the normal 0x01 Logitech keyboard report descriptor,
as expected, so it is just a matter of flagging it as supported.
