Subject: [PATCH] regulator: core: Use ktime_get_boottime() to determine how
 long a regulator was off
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: 80d2c29e09e663761c2778167a625b25ffe01b6f

commit 80d2c29e09e663761c2778167a625b25ffe01b6f upstream.

For regulators with 'off-on-delay-us' the regulator framework currently
uses ktime_get() to determine how long the regulator has been off
before re-enabling it (after a delay if needed). A problem with using
ktime_get() is that it doesn't account for the time the system is
suspended. As a result a regulator with a longer 'off-on-delay' (e.g.
500ms) that was switched off during suspend might still incurr in a
delay on resume before it is re-enabled, even though the regulator
might have been off for hours. ktime_get_boottime() accounts for
suspend time, use it instead of ktime_get().
