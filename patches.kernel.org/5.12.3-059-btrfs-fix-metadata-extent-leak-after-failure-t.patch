Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: fix metadata extent leak after failure to create
 subvolume
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.3
Git-commit: 67addf29004c5be9fa0383c82a364bb59afc7f84

commit 67addf29004c5be9fa0383c82a364bb59afc7f84 upstream.

When creating a subvolume we allocate an extent buffer for its root node
after starting a transaction. We setup a root item for the subvolume that
points to that extent buffer and then attempt to insert the root item into
the root tree - however if that fails, due to ENOMEM for example, we do
not free the extent buffer previously allocated and we do not abort the
transaction (as at that point we did nothing that can not be undone).

This means that we effectively do not return the metadata extent back to
the free space cache/tree and we leave a delayed reference for it which
causes a metadata extent item to be added to the extent tree, in the next
transaction commit, without having backreferences. When this happens
'btrfs check' reports the following:

  $ btrfs check /dev/sdi
  Opening filesystem to check...

  found 212992 bytes used, error(s) found
  total csum bytes: 0
  total tree bytes: 131072
  total fs tree bytes: 32768
  total extent tree bytes: 16384
  btree space waste bytes: 124669
  file data blocks allocated: 65536
   referenced 65536

So fix this by freeing the metadata extent if btrfs_insert_root() returns
an error.
