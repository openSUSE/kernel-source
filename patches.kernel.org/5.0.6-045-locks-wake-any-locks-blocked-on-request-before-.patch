Subject: [PATCH] locks: wake any locks blocked on request before deadlock
 check
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.6
Git-commit: 945ab8f6de94430c23a82f3cf2e3f6d6f2945ff7

commit 945ab8f6de94430c23a82f3cf2e3f6d6f2945ff7 upstream.

Andreas reported that he was seeing the tdbtorture test fail in some
cases with -EDEADLCK when it wasn't before. Some debugging showed that
deadlock detection was sometimes discovering the caller's lock request
itself in a dependency chain.

While we remove the request from the blocked_lock_hash prior to
reattempting to acquire it, any locks that are blocked on that request
will still be present in the hash and will still have their fl_blocker
pointer set to the current request.

This causes posix_locks_deadlock to find a deadlock dependency chain
when it shouldn't, as a lock request cannot block itself.

We are going to end up waking all of those blocked locks anyway when we
go to reinsert the request back into the blocked_lock_hash, so just do
it prior to checking for deadlocks. This ensures that any lock blocked
on the current request will no longer be part of any blocked request
chain.
