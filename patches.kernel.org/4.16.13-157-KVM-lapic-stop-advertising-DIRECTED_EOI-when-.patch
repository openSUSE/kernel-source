Subject: [PATCH] KVM: lapic: stop advertising DIRECTED_EOI when in-kernel
 IOAPIC is in use

[ Upstream commit 0bcc3fb95b97ac2ca223a5a870287b37f56265ac ]

Devices which use level-triggered interrupts under Windows 2016 with
Hyper-V role enabled don't work: Windows disables EOI broadcast in SPIV
unconditionally. Our in-kernel IOAPIC implementation emulates an old IOAPIC
version which has no EOI register so EOI never happens.

The issue was discovered and discussed a while ago:
https://www.spinics.net/lists/kvm/msg148098.html

While this is a guest OS bug (it should check that IOAPIC has the required
capabilities before disabling EOI broadcast) we can workaround it in KVM:
advertising DIRECTED_EOI with in-kernel IOAPIC makes little sense anyway.
