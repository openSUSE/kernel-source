Subject: [PATCH] x86/tsc_msr: Make MSR derived TSC frequency more accurate
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

commit fac01d11722c92a186b27ee26cd429a8066adfb5 upstream.

The "Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual Volume 4:
Model-Specific Registers" has the following table for the values from
freq_desc_byt:

   000B: 083.3 MHz
   001B: 100.0 MHz
   010B: 133.3 MHz
   011B: 116.7 MHz
   100B: 080.0 MHz

Notice how for e.g the 83.3 MHz value there are 3 significant digits, which
translates to an accuracy of a 1000 ppm, where as a typical crystal
oscillator is 20 - 100 ppm, so the accuracy of the frequency format used in
the Software Developer’s Manual is not really helpful.

As far as we know Bay Trail SoCs use a 25 MHz crystal and Cherry Trail
uses a 19.2 MHz crystal, the crystal is the source clock for a root PLL
which outputs 1600 and 100 MHz. It is unclear if the root PLL outputs are
used directly by the CPU clock PLL or if there is another PLL in between.

This does not matter though, we can model the chain of PLLs as a single PLL
with a quotient equal to the quotients of all PLLs in the chain multiplied.

So we can create a simplified model of the CPU clock setup using a
reference clock of 100 MHz plus a quotient which gets us as close to the
frequency from the SDM as possible.

For the 83.3 MHz example from above this would give 100 MHz * 5 / 6 = 83
and 1/3 MHz, which matches exactly what has been measured on actual
hardware.

Use a simplified PLL model with a reference clock of 100 MHz for all Bay
and Cherry Trail models.

This has been tested on the following models:

              CPU freq before:        CPU freq after:
Intel N2840   2165.800 MHz            2166.667 MHz
Intel Z3736   1332.800 MHz            1333.333 MHz
Intel Z3775   1466.300 MHz            1466.667 MHz
Intel Z8350   1440.000 MHz            1440.000 MHz
Intel Z8750   1600.000 MHz            1600.000 MHz

This fixes the time drifting by about 1 second per hour (20 - 30 seconds
per day) on (some) devices which rely on the tsc_msr.c code to determine
the TSC frequency.
