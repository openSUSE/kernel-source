Subject: [PATCH] ARM: 9043/1: tegra: Fix misplaced tegra_uart_config in
 decompressor
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.15
Git-commit: 538eea5362a1179dfa7770dd2b6607dc30cc50c6

commit 538eea5362a1179dfa7770dd2b6607dc30cc50c6 upstream.

The tegra_uart_config of the DEBUG_LL code is now placed right at the
start of the .text section after commit which enabled debug output in the
decompressor. Tegra devices are not booting anymore if DEBUG_LL is enabled
since tegra_uart_config data is executes as a code. Fix the misplaced
tegra_uart_config storage by embedding it into the code.
