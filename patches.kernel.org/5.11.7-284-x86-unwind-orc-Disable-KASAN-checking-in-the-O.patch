Subject: [PATCH] x86/unwind/orc: Disable KASAN checking in the ORC unwinder,
 part 2
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.7
Git-commit: e504e74cc3a2c092b05577ce3e8e013fae7d94e6

commit e504e74cc3a2c092b05577ce3e8e013fae7d94e6 upstream.

KASAN reserves "redzone" areas between stack frames in order to detect
stack overruns.  A read or write to such an area triggers a KASAN
"stack-out-of-bounds" BUG.

Normally, the ORC unwinder stays in-bounds and doesn't access the
redzone.  But sometimes it can't find ORC metadata for a given
instruction.  This can happen for code which is missing ORC metadata, or
for generated code.  In such cases, the unwinder attempts to fall back
to frame pointers, as a best-effort type thing.

This fallback often works, but when it doesn't, the unwinder can get
confused and go off into the weeds into the KASAN redzone, triggering
the aforementioned KASAN BUG.

But in this case, the unwinder's confusion is actually harmless and
working as designed.  It already has checks in place to prevent
off-stack accesses, but those checks get short-circuited by the KASAN
BUG.  And a BUG is a lot more disruptive than a harmless unwinder
warning.

Disable the KASAN checks by using READ_ONCE_NOCHECK() for all stack
accesses.  This finishes the job started by commit 881125bfe65b
("x86/unwind: Disable KASAN checking in the ORC unwinder"), which only
partially fixed the issue.
