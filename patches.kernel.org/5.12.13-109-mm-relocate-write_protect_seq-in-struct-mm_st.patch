Subject: [PATCH] mm: relocate 'write_protect_seq' in struct mm_struct
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.13

[ Upstream commit 2e3025434a6ba090c85871a1d4080ff784109e1f ]

0day robot reported a 9.2% regression for will-it-scale mmap1 test
case[1], caused by commit 57efa1fe5957 ("mm/gup: prevent gup_fast from
racing with COW during fork").

Further debug shows the regression is due to that commit changes the
offset of hot fields 'mmap_lock' inside structure 'mm_struct', thus some
cache alignment changes.

From the perf data, the contention for 'mmap_lock' is very severe and
takes around 95% cpu cycles, and it is a rw_semaphore

        struct rw_semaphore {
                atomic_long_t count;	/* 8 bytes */
                atomic_long_t owner;	/* 8 bytes */
                struct optimistic_spin_queue osq; /* spinner MCS lock */
                ...

Before commit 57efa1fe5957 adds the 'write_protect_seq', it happens to
have a very optimal cache alignment layout, as Linus explained:

 "and before the addition of the 'write_protect_seq' field, the
  mmap_sem was at offset 120 in 'struct mm_struct'.

  Which meant that count and owner were in two different cachelines,
  and then when you have contention and spend time in
  rwsem_down_write_slowpath(), this is probably *exactly* the kind
  of layout you want.

  Because first the rwsem_write_trylock() will do a cmpxchg on the
  first cacheline (for the optimistic fast-path), and then in the
  case of contention, rwsem_down_write_slowpath() will just access
  the second cacheline.

  Which is probably just optimal for a load that spends a lot of
  time contended - new waiters touch that first cacheline, and then
  they queue themselves up on the second cacheline."

After the commit, the rw_semaphore is at offset 128, which means the
'count' and 'owner' fields are now in the same cacheline, and causes
more cache bouncing.

Currently there are 3 "#ifdef CONFIG_XXX" before 'mmap_lock' which will
affect its offset:

  CONFIG_MMU
  CONFIG_MEMBARRIER
  CONFIG_HAVE_ARCH_COMPAT_MMAP_BASES

The layout above is on 64 bits system with 0day's default kernel config
(similar to RHEL-8.3's config), in which all these 3 options are 'y'.
And the layout can vary with different kernel configs.

Relayouting a structure is usually a double-edged sword, as sometimes it
can helps one case, but hurt other cases.  For this case, one solution
is, as the newly added 'write_protect_seq' is a 4 bytes long seqcount_t
(when CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC=n), placing it into an existing 4 bytes
hole in 'mm_struct' will not change other fields' alignment, while
restoring the regression.
