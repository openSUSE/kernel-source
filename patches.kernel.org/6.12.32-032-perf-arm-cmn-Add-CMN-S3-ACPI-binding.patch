Subject: [PATCH] perf/arm-cmn: Add CMN S3 ACPI binding
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.32
Git-commit: 8c138a189f6db295ceb32258d46ac061df0823e5

commit 8c138a189f6db295ceb32258d46ac061df0823e5 upstream.

An ACPI binding for CMN S3 was not yet finalised when the driver support
was originally written, but v1.2 of DEN0093 "ACPI for Arm Components"
has at last been published; support ACPI systems using the proper HID.
