Subject: [PATCH] arm: dts: mt7623: fix invalid memory node being generated
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.4
Git-commit: c0b0d540db1a8bfb041166c4991dd6f624e8de45

commit c0b0d540db1a8bfb041166c4991dd6f624e8de45 upstream.

Below two wrong nodes in existing DTS files would cause a fail boot since
in fact the address 0 is not the correct place the memory device locates
at.

memory {
        device_type = "memory";
        reg = <0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0>;
};

memory@80000000 {
        reg = <0x0 0x80000000 0x0 0x40000000>;
};

In order to avoid having a memory node starting at address 0, we can't
include file skeleton64.dtsi and instead need to explicitly manually
define a few of properties the DTS relies on such as #address-cells
and #size-cells in root node and device_type in the node memory@80000000.
