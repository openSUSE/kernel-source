Subject: [PATCH] ext4: prevent right-shifting extents beyond EXT_MAX_BLOCKS
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.7
Git-commit: 349fa7d6e1935f49bf4161c4900711b2989180a9

commit 349fa7d6e1935f49bf4161c4900711b2989180a9 upstream.

During the "insert range" fallocate operation, extents starting at the
range offset are shifted "right" (to a higher file offset) by the range
length.  But, as shown by syzbot, it's not validated that this doesn't
cause extents to be shifted beyond EXT_MAX_BLOCKS.  In that case
->ee_block can wrap around, corrupting the extent tree.

Fix it by returning an error if the space between the end of the last
extent and EXT4_MAX_BLOCKS is smaller than the range being inserted.

This bug can be reproduced by running the following commands when the
current directory is on an ext4 filesystem with a 4k block size:

        fallocate -l 8192 file
        fallocate --keep-size -o 0xfffffffe000 -l 4096 -n file
        fallocate --insert-range -l 8192 file

Then after unmounting the filesystem, e2fsck reports corruption.
