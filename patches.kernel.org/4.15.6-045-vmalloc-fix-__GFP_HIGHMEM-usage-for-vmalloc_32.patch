Subject: [PATCH] vmalloc: fix __GFP_HIGHMEM usage for vmalloc_32 on 32b
 systems

commit 698d0831ba87b92ae10b15e8203cfd59f5a59a35 upstream.

Kai Heng Feng has noticed that BUG_ON(PageHighMem(pg)) triggers in
drivers/media/common/saa7146/saa7146_core.c since 19809c2da28a ("mm,
vmalloc: use __GFP_HIGHMEM implicitly").

saa7146_vmalloc_build_pgtable uses vmalloc_32 and it is reasonable to
expect that the resulting page is not in highmem.  The above commit
aimed to add __GFP_HIGHMEM only for those requests which do not specify
any zone modifier gfp flag.  vmalloc_32 relies on GFP_VMALLOC32 which
should do the right thing.  Except it has been missed that GFP_VMALLOC32
is an alias for GFP_KERNEL on 32b architectures.  Thanks to Matthew to
notice this.

Fix the problem by unconditionally setting GFP_DMA32 in GFP_VMALLOC32
for !64b arches (as a bailout).  This should do the right thing and use
ZONE_NORMAL which should be always below 4G on 32b systems.

Debugged by Matthew Wilcox.
