Subject: [PATCH] kselftest/arm64: sve: Do not use non-canonical FFR register
 value
References: bsc#1012628

[ Upstream commit 7011d72588d16a9e5f5d85acbc8b10019809599c ]

The "First Fault Register" (FFR) is an SVE register that mimics a
predicate register, but clears bits when a load or store fails to handle
an element of a vector. The supposed usage scenario is to initialise
this register (using SETFFR), then *read* it later on to learn about
elements that failed to load or store. Explicit writes to this register
using the WRFFR instruction are only supposed to *restore* values
previously read from the register (for context-switching only).
As the manual describes, this register holds only certain values, it:
"... contains a monotonic predicate value, in which starting from bit 0
there are zero or more 1 bits, followed only by 0 bits in any remaining
bit positions."
Any other value is UNPREDICTABLE and is not supposed to be "restored"
into the register.

The SVE test currently tries to write a signature pattern into the
register, which is *not* a canonical FFR value. Apparently the existing
setups treat UNPREDICTABLE as "read-as-written", but a new
implementation actually only stores canonical values. As a consequence,
the sve-test fails immediately when comparing the FFR value:
-----------
 # ./sve-test
Vector length:  128 bits
PID:    207
Mismatch: PID=207, iteration=0, reg=48
        Expected [cf00]
        Got      [0f00]
Aborted
-----------

Fix this by only populating the FFR with proper canonical values.
Effectively the requirement described above limits us to 17 unique
values over 16 bits worth of FFR, so we condense our signature down to 4
bits (2 bits from the PID, 2 bits from the generation) and generate the
canonical pattern from it. Any bits describing elements above the
minimum 128 bit are set to 0.

This aligns the FFR usage to the architecture and fixes the test on
microarchitectures implementing FFR in a more restricted way.
