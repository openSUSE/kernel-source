Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: hikey: Give wifi some time after power-on
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.2
Git-commit: 83b944174ad79825ae84a47af1a0354485b24602

commit 83b944174ad79825ae84a47af1a0354485b24602 upstream.

Somewhere along recent changes to power control of the wl1835, power-on
became very unreliable on the hikey, failing like this:

wl1271_sdio: probe of mmc2:0001:1 failed with error -16
wl1271_sdio: probe of mmc2:0001:2 failed with error -16

After playing with some dt parameters and comparing to other users of
this chip, it turned out we need some power-on delay to make things
stable again. In contrast to those other users which define 200 ms, the
hikey would already be happy with 1 ms. Still, we use the safer 10 ms,
like on the Ultra96.
