Subject: [PATCH] platform/x86: hp_accel: Add quirk for HP ProBook 440 G4
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.8
Git-commit: 163ca80013aafb6dc9cb295de3db7aeab9ab43f8

[ Upstream commit 163ca80013aafb6dc9cb295de3db7aeab9ab43f8 ]

Added support for HP ProBook 440 G4 laptops by including the accelerometer
orientation quirk for that device. Testing was performed based on the
axis orientation guidelines here:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/misc-devices/lis3lv02d
which states "If the left side is elevated, X increases (becomes positive)".

When tested, on lifting the left edge, x values became increasingly negative
thus indicating an inverted x-axis on the installed lis3lv02d chip.
This was compensated by adding an entry for this device in hp_accel.c
specifying the quirk as x_inverted. The patch was tested on a
ProBook 440 G4 device and x-axis as well as y and z-axis values are now
generated as per spec.
