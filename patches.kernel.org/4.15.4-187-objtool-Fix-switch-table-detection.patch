Subject: [PATCH] objtool: Fix switch-table detection
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.4
Git-commit: 99ce7962d52d1948ad6f2785e308d48e76e0a6ef

commit 99ce7962d52d1948ad6f2785e308d48e76e0a6ef upstream.

Linus reported that GCC-7.3 generated a switch-table construct that
confused objtool. It turns out that, in particular due to KASAN, it is
possible to have unrelated .rodata usage in between the .rodata setup
for the switch-table and the following indirect jump.

The simple linear reverse search from the indirect jump would hit upon
the KASAN .rodata usage first and fail to find a switch_table,
resulting in a spurious 'sibling call with modified stack frame'
warning.

Fix this by creating a 'jump-stack' which we can 'unwind' during
reversal, thereby skipping over much of the in-between code.

This is not fool proof by any means, but is sufficient to make the
known cases work. Future work would be to construct more comprehensive
flow analysis code.
