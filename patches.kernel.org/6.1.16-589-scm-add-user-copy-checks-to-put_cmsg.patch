Subject: [PATCH] scm: add user copy checks to put_cmsg()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: 5f1eb1ff58ea122e24adf0bc940f268ed2227462

[ Upstream commit 5f1eb1ff58ea122e24adf0bc940f268ed2227462 ]

This is a followup of commit 2558b8039d05 ("net: use a bounce
buffer for copying skb->mark")

x86 and powerpc define user_access_begin, meaning
that they are not able to perform user copy checks
when using user_write_access_begin() / unsafe_copy_to_user()
and friends [1]

Instead of waiting bugs to trigger on other arches,
add a check_object_size() in put_cmsg() to make sure
that new code tested on x86 with CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY=y
will perform more security checks.

[1] We can not generically call check_object_size() from
unsafe_copy_to_user() because UACCESS is enabled at this point.
