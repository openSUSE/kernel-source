Subject: [PATCH] x86/topology: Use total_cpus for max logical packages
 calculation
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.5
Git-commit: aa02ef099cff042c2a9109782ec2bf1bffc955d4

[ Upstream commit aa02ef099cff042c2a9109782ec2bf1bffc955d4 ]

nr_cpu_ids can be limited on the command line via nr_cpus=. This can break the
logical package management because it results in a smaller number of packages
while in kdump kernel.

Check below case:
There is a two sockets system, each socket has 8 cores, which has 16 logical
cpus while HT was turn on.

 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7     |    16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
 cores on socket 0               threads on socket 0
 8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15     |    24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31
 cores on socket 1               threads on socket 1

While starting the kdump kernel with command line option nr_cpus=16 panic
was triggered on one of the cpus 24-31 eg. 26, then online cpu will be
1-15, 26(cpu 0 was disabled in kdump), ncpus will be 16 and
__max_logical_packages will be 1, but actually two packages were booted on.

This issue can reproduced by set kdump option nr_cpus=<real physical core
numbers>, and then trigger panic on last socket's thread, for example:

taskset -c 26 echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger

Use total_cpus which will not be limited by nr_cpus command line to calculate
the value of __max_logical_packages.
