Subject: [PATCH] mm/memory: do not populate page table entries beyond i_size
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.9
Git-commit: 74207de2ba10c2973334906822dc94d2e859ffc5

commit 74207de2ba10c2973334906822dc94d2e859ffc5 upstream.

Patch series "Fix SIGBUS semantics with large folios", v3.

Accessing memory within a VMA, but beyond i_size rounded up to the next
page size, is supposed to generate SIGBUS.

Darrick reported[1] an xfstests regression in v6.18-rc1.  generic/749
failed due to missing SIGBUS.  This was caused by my recent changes that
try to fault in the whole folio where possible:

        19773df031bc ("mm/fault: try to map the entire file folio in finish_fault()")
        357b92761d94 ("mm/filemap: map entire large folio faultaround")

These changes did not consider i_size when setting up PTEs, leading to
xfstest breakage.

However, the problem has been present in the kernel for a long time -
since huge tmpfs was introduced in 2016.  The kernel happily maps
PMD-sized folios as PMD without checking i_size.  And huge=always tmpfs
allocates PMD-size folios on any writes.

I considered this corner case when I implemented a large tmpfs, and my
conclusion was that no one in their right mind should rely on receiving a
SIGBUS signal when accessing beyond i_size.  I cannot imagine how it could
be useful for the workload.

But apparently filesystem folks care a lot about preserving strict SIGBUS
semantics.

Generic/749 was introduced last year with reference to POSIX, but no real
workloads were mentioned.  It also acknowledged the tmpfs deviation from
the test case.

POSIX indeed says[3]:

        References within the address range starting at pa and
        continuing for len bytes to whole pages following the end of an
        object shall result in delivery of a SIGBUS signal.

The patchset fixes the regression introduced by recent changes as well as
more subtle SIGBUS breakage due to split failure on truncation.


This patch (of 2):

Accesses within VMA, but beyond i_size rounded up to PAGE_SIZE are
supposed to generate SIGBUS.

Recent changes attempted to fault in full folio where possible.  They did
not respect i_size, which led to populating PTEs beyond i_size and
breaking SIGBUS semantics.

Darrick reported generic/749 breakage because of this.

However, the problem existed before the recent changes.  With huge=always
tmpfs, any write to a file leads to PMD-size allocation.  Following the
fault-in of the folio will install PMD mapping regardless of i_size.

Fix filemap_map_pages() and finish_fault() to not install:
  - PTEs beyond i_size;
  - PMD mappings across i_size;

Make an exception for shmem/tmpfs that for long time intentionally
mapped with PMDs across i_size.
