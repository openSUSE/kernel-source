Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: stm32: Update part number NVMEM description on
 stm32mp131
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: 366384e495511bea8583e44173629a3012d62db0

[ Upstream commit 366384e495511bea8583e44173629a3012d62db0 ]

The STM32MP13x Device Part Number (also named RPN in reference manual)
only uses the first 12 bits in OTP4, all the other bit are reserved and
they can be different of zero; they must be masked in NVMEM result, so
the number of bits must be defined in the nvmem cell description.
