Subject: [PATCH] net: ipa: compute DMA pool size properly
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.23
Git-commit: 6c75dc94f2b27fff57b305af9236eea181a00b6c

[ Upstream commit 6c75dc94f2b27fff57b305af9236eea181a00b6c ]

In gsi_trans_pool_init_dma(), the total size of a pool of memory
used for DMA transactions is calculated.  However the calculation is
done incorrectly.

For 4KB pages, this total size is currently always more than one
page, and as a result, the calculation produces a positive (though
incorrect) total size.  The code still works in this case; we just
end up with fewer DMA pool entries than we intended.

Bjorn Andersson tested booting a kernel with 16KB pages, and hit a
null pointer derereference in sg_alloc_append_table_from_pages(),
descending from gsi_trans_pool_init_dma().  The cause of this was
that a 16KB total size was going to be allocated, and with 16KB
pages the order of that allocation is 0.  The total_size calculation
yielded 0, which eventually led to the crash.

Correcting the total_size calculation fixes the problem.
