Subject: [PATCH] ring-buffer: Do not trigger WARN_ON() due to a commit_overrun
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.3
Git-commit: 4fc78a7c9ca994e1da5d3940704d4e8f0ea8c5e4

commit 4fc78a7c9ca994e1da5d3940704d4e8f0ea8c5e4 upstream.

When reading a memory mapped buffer the reader page is just swapped out
with the last page written in the write buffer. If the reader page is the
same as the commit buffer (the buffer that is currently being written to)
it was assumed that it should never have missed events. If it does, it
triggers a WARN_ON_ONCE().

But there just happens to be one scenario where this can legitimately
happen. That is on a commit_overrun. A commit overrun is when an interrupt
preempts an event being written to the buffer and then the interrupt adds
so many new events that it fills and wraps the buffer back to the commit.
Any new events would then be dropped and be reported as "missed_events".

In this case, the next page to read is the commit buffer and after the
swap of the reader page, the reader page will be the commit buffer, but
this time there will be missed events and this triggers the following
warning:

The above was triggered by running on a kernel with both lockdep and KASAN
as well as kmemleak enabled and executing the following command:

 # perf record -o perf-test.dat -a -- trace-cmd record --nosplice  -e all -p function hackbench 50

With perf interjecting a lot of interrupts and trace-cmd enabling all
events as well as function tracing, with lockdep, KASAN and kmemleak
enabled, it could cause an interrupt preempting an event being written to
add enough events to wrap the buffer. trace-cmd was modified to have
--nosplice use mmap instead of reading the buffer.

The way to differentiate this case from the normal case of there only
being one page written to where the swap of the reader page received that
one page (which is the commit page), check if the tail page is on the
reader page. The difference between the commit page and the tail page is
that the tail page is where new writes go to, and the commit page holds
the first write that hasn't been committed yet. In the case of an
interrupt preempting the write of an event and filling the buffer, it
would move the tail page but not the commit page.

Have the warning only trigger if the tail page is also on the reader page,
and also print out the number of events dropped by a commit overrun as
that can not yet be safely added to the page so that the reader can see
there were events dropped.
