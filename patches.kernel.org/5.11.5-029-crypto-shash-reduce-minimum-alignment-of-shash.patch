Subject: [PATCH] crypto - shash: reduce minimum alignment of shash_desc
 structure
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.5
Git-commit: 660d2062190db131d2feaf19914e90f868fe285c

commit 660d2062190db131d2feaf19914e90f868fe285c upstream.

Unlike many other structure types defined in the crypto API, the
'shash_desc' structure is permitted to live on the stack, which
implies its contents may not be accessed by DMA masters. (This is
due to the fact that the stack may be located in the vmalloc area,
which requires a different virtual-to-physical translation than the
one implemented by the DMA subsystem)

Our definition of CRYPTO_MINALIGN_ATTR is based on ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN,
which may take DMA constraints into account on architectures that support
non-cache coherent DMA such as ARM and arm64. In this case, the value is
chosen to reflect the largest cacheline size in the system, in order to
ensure that explicit cache maintenance as required by non-coherent DMA
masters does not affect adjacent, unrelated slab allocations. On arm64,
this value is currently set at 128 bytes.

This means that applying CRYPTO_MINALIGN_ATTR to struct shash_desc is both
unnecessary (as it is never used for DMA), and undesirable, given that it
wastes stack space (on arm64, performing the alignment costs 112 bytes in
the worst case, and the hole between the 'tfm' and '__ctx' members takes
up another 120 bytes, resulting in an increased stack footprint of up to
232 bytes.) So instead, let's switch to the minimum SLAB alignment, which
does not take DMA constraints into account.

Note that this is a no-op for x86.
