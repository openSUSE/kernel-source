Indeed, the variable pin6 is declared and initialized unconditionally,
while it is only used and needlessly re-initialized when support for
IPv6 is enabled.

Fix this by dropping the unused variable initialization, and moving the
variable declaration inside the existing section protected by a check
for CONFIG_IPV6.
