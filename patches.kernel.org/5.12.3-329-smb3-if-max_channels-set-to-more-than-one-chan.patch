Subject: [PATCH] smb3: if max_channels set to more than one channel request
 multichannel
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.3
Git-commit: c1f8a398b6d661b594556a91224b096d92293061

commit c1f8a398b6d661b594556a91224b096d92293061 upstream.

Mounting with "multichannel" is obviously implied if user requested
more than one channel on mount (ie mount parm max_channels>1).
Currently both have to be specified. Fix that so that if max_channels
is greater than 1 on mount, enable multichannel rather than silently
falling back to non-multichannel.
