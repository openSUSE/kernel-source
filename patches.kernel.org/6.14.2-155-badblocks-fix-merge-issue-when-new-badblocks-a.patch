Subject: [PATCH] badblocks: fix merge issue when new badblocks align with
 pre+1
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.2
Git-commit: 9ec65dec634a752ab0a1203510ee190356e4cf1a

[ Upstream commit 9ec65dec634a752ab0a1203510ee190356e4cf1a ]

There is a merge issue when adding badblocks as follow:
  echo 0 10 > bad_blocks
  echo 30 10 > bad_blocks
  echo 20 10 > bad_blocks
  cat bad_blocks
  0 10
  20 10    //should be merged with (30 10)
  30 10

In this case, if new badblocks does not intersect with prev, it is added
by insert_at(). If there is an intersection with prev+1, the merge will
be processed in the next re_insert loop.

However, when the end of the new badblocks is exactly equal to the offset
of prev+1, no further re_insert loop occurs, and the two badblocks are not
merge.

Fix it by inc prev, badblocks can be merged during the subsequent code.
