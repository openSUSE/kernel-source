Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: Fail emulation during EMULTYPE_SKIP on any
 exception
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.14
Git-commit: 17122c06b86c9f77f45b86b8e62c3ed440847a59

[ Upstream commit 17122c06b86c9f77f45b86b8e62c3ed440847a59 ]

Treat any exception during instruction decode for EMULTYPE_SKIP as a
"full" emulation failure, i.e. signal failure instead of queuing the
exception.  When decoding purely to skip an instruction, KVM and/or the
CPU has already done some amount of emulation that cannot be unwound,
e.g. on an EPT misconfig VM-Exit KVM has already processeed the emulated
MMIO.  KVM already does this if a #UD is encountered, but not for other
exceptions, e.g. if a #PF is encountered during fetch.

In SVM's soft-injection use case, queueing the exception is particularly
problematic as queueing exceptions while injecting events can put KVM
into an infinite loop due to bailing from VM-Enter to service the newly
pending exception.  E.g. multiple warnings to detect such behavior fire:
