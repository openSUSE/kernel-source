Subject: [PATCH] bpf, sockmap: fix potential use after free in bpf_tcp_close
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.13
Git-commit: e06fa9c16ce4b740996189fa5610eabcee734e6c

[ Upstream commit e06fa9c16ce4b740996189fa5610eabcee734e6c ]

bpf_tcp_close() we pop the psock linkage to a map via psock_map_pop().
A parallel update on the sock hash map can happen between psock_map_pop()
and lookup_elem_raw() where we override the element under link->hash /
link->key. In bpf_tcp_close()'s lookup_elem_raw() we subsequently only
test whether an element is present, but we do not test whether the
element is infact the element we were looking for.

We lock the sock in bpf_tcp_close() during that time, so do we hold
the lock in sock_hash_update_elem(). However, the latter locks the
sock which is newly updated, not the one we're purging from the hash
table. This means that while one CPU is doing the lookup from bpf_tcp_close(),
another CPU is doing the map update in parallel, dropped our sock from
the hlist and released the psock.

Subsequently the first CPU will find the new sock and attempts to drop
and release the old sock yet another time. Fix is that we need to check
the elements for a match after lookup, similar as we do in the sock map.
Note that the hash tab elems are freed via RCU, so access to their
link->hash / link->key is fine since we're under RCU read side there.
