Subject: [PATCH] sched_ext: Fix missing post-enqueue handling in
 move_local_task_to_local_dsq()
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.64
Git-commit: f5e1e5ec204da11fa87fdf006d451d80ce06e118

[ Upstream commit f5e1e5ec204da11fa87fdf006d451d80ce06e118 ]

move_local_task_to_local_dsq() is used when moving a task from a non-local
DSQ to a local DSQ on the same CPU. It directly manipulates the local DSQ
without going through dispatch_enqueue() and was missing the post-enqueue
handling that triggers preemption when SCX_ENQ_PREEMPT is set or the idle
task is running.

The function is used by move_task_between_dsqs() which backs
scx_bpf_dsq_move() and may be called while the CPU is busy.

Add local_dsq_post_enq() call to move_local_task_to_local_dsq(). As the
dispatch path doesn't need post-enqueue handling, add SCX_RQ_IN_BALANCE
early exit to keep consume_dispatch_q() behavior unchanged and avoid
triggering unnecessary resched when scx_bpf_dsq_move() is used from the
dispatch path.

Fixes: 4c30f5ce4f7a ("sched_ext: Implement scx_bpf_dispatch[_vtime]_from_dsq()")
