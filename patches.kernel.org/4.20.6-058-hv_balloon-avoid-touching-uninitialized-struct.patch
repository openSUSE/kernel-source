Subject: [PATCH] hv_balloon: avoid touching uninitialized struct page during
 tail onlining
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.6
Git-commit: da8ced360ca8ad72d8f41f5c8fcd5b0e63e1555f

commit da8ced360ca8ad72d8f41f5c8fcd5b0e63e1555f upstream.

Hyper-V memory hotplug protocol has 2M granularity and in Linux x86 we use
128M. To deal with it we implement partial section onlining by registering
custom page onlining callback (hv_online_page()). Later, when more memory
arrives we try to online the 'tail' (see hv_bring_pgs_online()).

It was found that in some cases this 'tail' onlining causes issues:

 BUG: Bad page state in process kworker/0:2  pfn:109e3a

  ...

Turns out that we now have deferred struct page initialization for memory
hotplug so e.g. memory_block_action() in drivers/base/memory.c does
pages_correctly_probed() check and in that check it avoids inspecting
struct pages and checks sections instead. But in Hyper-V balloon driver we
do PageReserved(pfn_to_page()) check and this is now wrong.

Switch to checking online_section_nr() instead.
