Subject: [PATCH] mmc: dw_mmc: Re-store SDIO IRQs mask at system resume
References: bnc#1151927
Patch-mainline: 5.3.4
Git-commit: 7c526608d5afb62cbc967225e2ccaacfdd142e9d

[ Upstream commit 7c526608d5afb62cbc967225e2ccaacfdd142e9d ]

In cases when SDIO IRQs have been enabled, runtime suspend is prevented by
the driver. However, this still means dw_mci_runtime_suspend|resume() gets
called during system suspend/resume, via pm_runtime_force_suspend|resume().
This means during system suspend/resume, the register context of the dw_mmc
device most likely loses its register context, even in cases when SDIO IRQs
have been enabled.

To re-enable the SDIO IRQs during system resume, the dw_mmc driver
currently relies on the mmc core to re-enable the SDIO IRQs when it resumes
the SDIO card, but this isn't the recommended solution. Instead, it's
better to deal with this locally in the dw_mmc driver, so let's do that.
