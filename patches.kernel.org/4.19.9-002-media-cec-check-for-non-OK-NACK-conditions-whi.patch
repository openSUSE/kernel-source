Subject: [PATCH] media: cec: check for non-OK/NACK conditions while claiming a
 LA
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.9
Git-commit: 55623b4169056d7bb493d1c6f715991f8db67302

[ Upstream commit 55623b4169056d7bb493d1c6f715991f8db67302 ]

During the configuration phase of a CEC adapter it is trying to claim a
free logical address by polling.

However, the code doesn't check if there were errors other than OK or NACK,
those are just treated as if the poll was NACKed.

Instead check for such errors and retry the poll. And if the problem persists
then don't claim this LA since there is something weird going on.
