Subject: [PATCH] rxrpc: Fix call ref leak
References: bnc#1151927
Patch-mainline: 5.3.9
Git-commit: c48fc11b69e95007109206311b0187a3090591f3

commit c48fc11b69e95007109206311b0187a3090591f3 upstream.

When sendmsg() finds a call to continue on with, if the call is in an
inappropriate state, it doesn't release the ref it just got on that call
before returning an error.

This causes the following symptom to show up with kasan:

	BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in rxrpc_send_keepalive+0x8a2/0x940
	net/rxrpc/output.c:635
	Read of size 8 at addr ffff888064219698 by task kworker/0:3/11077

where line 635 is:

	whdr.epoch	= htonl(peer->local->rxnet->epoch);

The local endpoint (which cannot be pinned by the call) has been released,
but not the peer (which is pinned by the call).

Fix this by releasing the call in the error path.
