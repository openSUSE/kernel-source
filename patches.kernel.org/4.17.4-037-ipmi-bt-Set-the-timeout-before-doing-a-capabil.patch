Subject: [PATCH] ipmi:bt: Set the timeout before doing a capabilities check
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.4
Git-commit: fe50a7d0393a552e4539da2d31261a59d6415950

commit fe50a7d0393a552e4539da2d31261a59d6415950 upstream.

There was one place where the timeout value for an operation was
not being set, if a capabilities request was done from idle.  Move
the timeout value setting to before where that change might be
requested.

IMHO the cause here is the invisible returns in the macros.  Maybe
that's a job for later, though.
