Subject: [PATCH] mm/rmap: map_pte() was not handling private ZONE_DEVICE page
 properly
MIME-Version: 1.0

Git-commit: aab8d0520e6e7c2a61f71195e6ce7007a4843afb

commit aab8d0520e6e7c2a61f71195e6ce7007a4843afb upstream.

Private ZONE_DEVICE pages use a special pte entry and thus are not
present.  Properly handle this case in map_pte(), it is already handled in
check_pte(), the map_pte() part was lost in some rebase most probably.

Without this patch the slow migration path can not migrate back to any
private ZONE_DEVICE memory to regular memory.  This was found after stress
testing migration back to system memory.  This ultimatly can lead to the
CPU constantly page fault looping on the special swap entry.
