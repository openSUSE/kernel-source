Subject: [PATCH] genirq: Make force irq threading setup more robust
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.14
Git-commit: d1f0301b3333eef5efbfa1fe0f0edbea01863d5d

commit d1f0301b3333eef5efbfa1fe0f0edbea01863d5d upstream.

The support of force threading interrupts which are set up with both a
primary and a threaded handler wreckaged the setup of regular requested
threaded interrupts (primary handler == NULL).

The reason is that it does not check whether the primary handler is set to
the default handler which wakes the handler thread. Instead it replaces the
thread handler with the primary handler as it would do with force threaded
interrupts which have been requested via request_irq(). So both the primary
and the thread handler become the same which then triggers the warnon that
the thread handler tries to wakeup a not configured secondary thread.

Fortunately this only happens when the driver omits the IRQF_ONESHOT flag
when requesting the threaded interrupt, which is normaly caught by the
sanity checks when force irq threading is disabled.

Fix it by skipping the force threading setup when a regular threaded
interrupt is requested. As a consequence the interrupt request which lacks
the IRQ_ONESHOT flag is rejected correctly instead of silently wreckaging
it.
