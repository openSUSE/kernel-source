Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: PCI: qcom,pcie-sc7280: Add missing required
 power-domains and resets
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.64
Git-commit: ef99c2efeacac7758cc8c2d00e3200100a4da16c

commit ef99c2efeacac7758cc8c2d00e3200100a4da16c upstream.

Commit 756485bfbb85 ("dt-bindings: PCI: qcom,pcie-sc7280: Move SC7280 to
dedicated schema") move the device schema to separate file, but it
missed a "if:not:...then:" clause in the original binding which was
requiring power-domains and resets for this particular chip.

Fixes: 756485bfbb85 ("dt-bindings: PCI: qcom,pcie-sc7280: Move SC7280 to dedicated schema")
