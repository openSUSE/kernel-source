Subject: [PATCH] userfaultfd: shmem: allocate anonymous memory for MAP_PRIVATE
 shmem
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.8
Git-commit: 5b51072e97d587186c2f5390c8c9c1fb7e179505

commit 5b51072e97d587186c2f5390c8c9c1fb7e179505 upstream.

Userfaultfd did not create private memory when UFFDIO_COPY was invoked
on a MAP_PRIVATE shmem mapping.  Instead it wrote to the shmem file,
even when that had not been opened for writing.  Though, fortunately,
that could only happen where there was a hole in the file.

Fix the shmem-backed implementation of UFFDIO_COPY to create private
memory for MAP_PRIVATE mappings.  The hugetlbfs-backed implementation
was already correct.

This change is visible to userland, if userfaultfd has been used in
unintended ways: so it introduces a small risk of incompatibility, but
is necessary in order to respect file permissions.

An app that uses UFFDIO_COPY for anything like postcopy live migration
won't notice the difference, and in fact it'll run faster because there
will be no copy-on-write and memory waste in the tmpfs pagecache
anymore.

Userfaults on MAP_PRIVATE shmem keep triggering only on file holes like
before.

The real zeropage can also be built on a MAP_PRIVATE shmem mapping
through UFFDIO_ZEROPAGE and that's safe because the zeropage pte is
never dirty, in turn even an mprotect upgrading the vma permission from
PROT_READ to PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE won't make the zeropage pte writable.
