Subject: [PATCH] serial: sc16is7xx: Put IOControl register into
 regmap_volatile
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.66
Git-commit: 77a82cebf0eb023203b4cb2235cab75afc77cccf

commit 77a82cebf0eb023203b4cb2235cab75afc77cccf upstream.

According to the IOControl register bits description in the page 31 of
the product datasheet, we know the bit 3 of IOControl register is
softreset, this bit will self-clearing once the reset finish.

In the probe, the softreset bit is set, and when we read this register
from debugfs/regmap interface, we found the softreset bit is still
setting, this confused us for a while. Finally we found this register
is cached, to read the real value from register, we could put it
into the regmap_volatile().
