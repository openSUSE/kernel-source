Subject: [PATCH] ecryptfs_lookup_interpose(): lower_dentry->d_inode is not
 stable
References: bnc#1151927
Patch-mainline: 5.3.12
Git-commit: e72b9dd6a5f17d0fb51f16f8685f3004361e83d0

commit e72b9dd6a5f17d0fb51f16f8685f3004361e83d0 upstream.

lower_dentry can't go from positive to negative (we have it pinned),
but it *can* go from negative to positive.  So fetching ->d_inode
into a local variable, doing a blocking allocation, checking that
now ->d_inode is non-NULL and feeding the value we'd fetched
earlier to a function that won't accept NULL is not a good idea.
