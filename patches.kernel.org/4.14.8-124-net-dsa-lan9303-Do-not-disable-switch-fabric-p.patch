Subject: [PATCH] net: dsa: lan9303: Do not disable switch fabric port 0 at
 .probe
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.8
Git-commit: 3c91b0c1de8d013490bbc41ce9ee8810ea5baddd

[ Upstream commit 3c91b0c1de8d013490bbc41ce9ee8810ea5baddd ]

Make the LAN9303 work when lan9303_probe() is called twice.

For some unknown reason the LAN9303 switch fail to forward data when switch
fabric port 0 TX is disabled during probe. (Write of LAN9303_MAC_TX_CFG_0
in lan9303_disable_processing_port().)

In that situation the switch fabric seem to receive frames, because the ALR
is learning addresses. But no frames are transmitted on any of the ports.

In our system lan9303_probe() is called twice, first time
dsa_register_switch() return -EPROBE_DEFER. As an experiment, modified the
code to skip writing LAN9303_MAC_TX_CFG_0, port 0 during the first probe.
Then the switch works as expected.

Resolve the problem by not calling lan9303_disable_processing_port() on
port 0 during probe. Ports 1 and 2 are still disabled.

Although unsatisfying that the exact failure mechanism is not known,
the patch should not cause any harm.
