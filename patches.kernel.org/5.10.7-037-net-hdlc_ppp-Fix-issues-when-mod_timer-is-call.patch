Subject: [PATCH] net: hdlc_ppp: Fix issues when mod_timer is called while
 timer is running
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.7
Git-commit: 1fef73597fa545c35fddc953979013882fbd4e55

[ Upstream commit 1fef73597fa545c35fddc953979013882fbd4e55 ]

ppp_cp_event is called directly or indirectly by ppp_rx with "ppp->lock"
held. It may call mod_timer to add a new timer. However, at the same time
ppp_timer may be already running and waiting for "ppp->lock". In this
case, there's no need for ppp_timer to continue running and it can just
exit.

If we let ppp_timer continue running, it may call add_timer. This causes
kernel panic because add_timer can't be called with a timer pending.
This patch fixes this problem.

Fixes: e022c2f07ae5 ("WAN: new synchronous PPP implementation for generic HDLC.")
