Subject: [PATCH] arm64: Lower priority mask for GIC_PRIO_IRQON
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.10
Git-commit: 677379bc9139ac24b310a281fcb21a2f04288353

[ Upstream commit 677379bc9139ac24b310a281fcb21a2f04288353 ]

On a system with two security states, if SCR_EL3.FIQ is cleared,
non-secure IRQ priorities get shifted to fit the secure view but
priority masks aren't.

On such system, it turns out that GIC_PRIO_IRQON masks the priority of
normal interrupts, which obviously ends up in a hang.

Increase GIC_PRIO_IRQON value (i.e. lower priority) to make sure
interrupts are not blocked by it.
