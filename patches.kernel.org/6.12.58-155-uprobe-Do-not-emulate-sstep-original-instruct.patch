Subject: [PATCH] uprobe: Do not emulate/sstep original instruction when ip is
 changed
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.58
Git-commit: 4363264111e1297fa37aa39b0598faa19298ecca

[ Upstream commit 4363264111e1297fa37aa39b0598faa19298ecca ]

If uprobe handler changes instruction pointer we still execute single
step) or emulate the original instruction and increment the (new) ip
with its length.

This makes the new instruction pointer bogus and application will
likely crash on illegal instruction execution.

If user decided to take execution elsewhere, it makes little sense
to execute the original instruction, so let's skip it.
