Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: don't prematurely free work in end_workqueue_fn()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.7
Git-commit: 9be490f1e15c34193b1aae17da58e14dd9f55a95

[ Upstream commit 9be490f1e15c34193b1aae17da58e14dd9f55a95 ]

Currently, end_workqueue_fn() frees the end_io_wq entry (which embeds
the work item) and then calls bio_endio(). This is another potential
instance of the bug in "btrfs: don't prematurely free work in
run_ordered_work()".

In particular, the endio call may depend on other work items. For
example, btrfs_end_dio_bio() can call btrfs_subio_endio_read() ->
__btrfs_correct_data_nocsum() -> dio_read_error() ->
submit_dio_repair_bio(), which submits a bio that is also completed
through a end_workqueue_fn() work item. However,
__btrfs_correct_data_nocsum() waits for the newly submitted bio to
complete, thus it depends on another work item.

This example currently usually works because we use different workqueue
helper functions for BTRFS_WQ_ENDIO_DATA and BTRFS_WQ_ENDIO_DIO_REPAIR.
However, it may deadlock with stacked filesystems and is fragile
overall. The proper fix is to free the work item at the very end of the
work function, so let's do that.
