Subject: [PATCH] x86/mce: Fix machine_check_poll() tests for error types
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.6
Git-commit: f19501aa07f18268ab14f458b51c1c6b7f72a134

[ Upstream commit f19501aa07f18268ab14f458b51c1c6b7f72a134 ]

There has been a lurking "TBD" in the machine check poll routine ever
since it was first split out from the machine check handler. The
potential issue is that the poll routine may have just begun a read from
the STATUS register in a machine check bank when the hardware logs an
error in that bank and signals a machine check.

That race used to be pretty small back when machine checks were
broadcast, but the addition of local machine check means that the poll
code could continue running and clear the error from the bank before the
local machine check handler on another CPU gets around to reading it.

Fix the code to be sure to only process errors that need to be processed
in the poll code, leaving other logged errors alone for the machine
check handler to find and process.

 [ bp: Massage a bit and flip the "== 0" check to the usual !(..) test. ]

Fixes: b79109c3bbcf ("x86, mce: separate correct machine check poller and fatal exception handler")
Fixes: ed7290d0ee8f ("x86, mce: implement new status bits")
