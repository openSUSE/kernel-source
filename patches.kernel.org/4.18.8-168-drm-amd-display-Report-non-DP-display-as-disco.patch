Subject: [PATCH] drm/amd/display: Report non-DP display as disconnected
 without EDID
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.8
Git-commit: 01dc285d5cd89b77686d8baef8482c58d7dc3ead

commit 01dc285d5cd89b77686d8baef8482c58d7dc3ead upstream.

[Why]
Some boards seem to have a problem where HPD is high on HDMI even though
no display is connected. We don't want to report these as connected. DP
spec still requires us to report DP displays as connected when HPD is
high but we can't read the EDID in order to go to fail-safe mode.

[How]
If connector_signal is not DP abort detection if we can't retrieve the
EDID.

v2: Add Bugzilla and stable
