Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: fix mibit vs mbit mix up
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.11
Git-commit: 3de88b95c4d436d78afc0266a0bed76c35ddeb62

[ Upstream commit 3de88b95c4d436d78afc0266a0bed76c35ddeb62 ]

The estimated time was supposing the rate was expressed in mibit
(bit * 1024^2) but it is in mbit (bit * 1000^2).

This makes the threshold higher but in a more realistic way to avoid
false positives reported by CI instances.

Before this patch, the thresholds were at 7561/4005ms and now they are
at 7906/4178ms.

While at it, also fix a typo in the linked comment, spotted by Mat.

Closes: https://github.com/multipath-tcp/mptcp_net-next/issues/310
Fixes: 1a418cb8e888 ("mptcp: simult flow self-tests")
