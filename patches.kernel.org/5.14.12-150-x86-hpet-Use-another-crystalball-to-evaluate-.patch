Subject: [PATCH] x86/hpet: Use another crystalball to evaluate HPET usability
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.12
Git-commit: 6e3cd95234dc1eda488f4f487c281bac8fef4d9b

commit 6e3cd95234dc1eda488f4f487c281bac8fef4d9b upstream.

On recent Intel systems the HPET stops working when the system reaches PC10
idle state.

The approach of adding PCI ids to the early quirks to disable HPET on
these systems is a whack a mole game which makes no sense.

Check for PC10 instead and force disable HPET if supported. The check is
overbroad as it does not take ACPI, intel_idle enablement and command
line parameters into account. That's fine as long as there is at least
PMTIMER available to calibrate the TSC frequency. The decision can be
overruled by adding "hpet=force" on the kernel command line.

Remove the related early PCI quirks for affected Ice Cake and Coffin Lake
systems as they are not longer required. That should also cover all
other systems, i.e. Tiger Rag and newer generations, which are most
likely affected by this as well.

Fixes: Yet another hardware trainwreck
