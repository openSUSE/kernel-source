Subject: [PATCH] pwm: lpss: Fix get_state runtime-pm reference handling
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.7.5
Git-commit: 01aa905d4791da7d3630f6030ff99d58105cca00

commit 01aa905d4791da7d3630f6030ff99d58105cca00 upstream.

Before commit cfc4c189bc70 ("pwm: Read initial hardware state at request
time"), a driver's get_state callback would get called once per PWM from
pwmchip_add().

pwm-lpss' runtime-pm code was relying on this, getting a runtime-pm ref for
PWMs which are enabled at probe time from within its get_state callback,
before enabling runtime-pm.

The change to calling get_state at request time causes a number of
problems:

1. PWMs enabled at probe time may get runtime suspended before they are
requested, causing e.g. a LCD backlight controlled by the PWM to turn off.

2. When the request happens when the PWM has been runtime suspended, the
ctrl register will read all 1 / 0xffffffff, causing get_state to store
bogus values in the pwm_state.

3. get_state was using an async pm_runtime_get() call, because it assumed
that runtime-pm has not been enabled yet. If shortly after the request an
apply call is made, then the pwm_lpss_is_updating() check may trigger
because the resume triggered by the pm_runtime_get() call is not complete
yet, so the ctrl register still reads all 1 / 0xffffffff.

This commit fixes these issues by moving the initial pm_runtime_get() call
for PWMs which are enabled at probe time to the pwm_lpss_probe() function;
and by making get_state take a runtime-pm ref before reading the ctrl reg.
