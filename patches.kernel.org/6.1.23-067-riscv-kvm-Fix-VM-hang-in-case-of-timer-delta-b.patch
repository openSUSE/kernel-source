Subject: [PATCH] riscv/kvm: Fix VM hang in case of timer delta being zero.
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.23
Git-commit: 6eff38048944cadc3cddcf117acfa5199ec32490

[ Upstream commit 6eff38048944cadc3cddcf117acfa5199ec32490 ]

In case when VCPU is blocked due to WFI, we schedule the timer
from `kvm_riscv_vcpu_timer_blocking()` to keep timer interrupt
ticking.

But in case when delta_ns comes to be zero, we never schedule
the timer and VCPU keeps sleeping indefinitely until any activity
is done with VM console.

This is easily reproduce-able using kvmtool.
./lkvm-static run -c1 --console virtio -p "earlycon root=/dev/vda" \
         -k ./Image -d rootfs.ext4

Also, just add a print in kvm_riscv_vcpu_vstimer_expired() to
check the interrupt delivery and run `top` or similar auto-upating
cmd from guest. Within sometime one can notice that print from
timer expiry routine stops and the `top` cmd output will stop
updating.

This change fixes this by making sure we schedule the timer even
with delta_ns being zero to bring the VCPU out of sleep immediately.
