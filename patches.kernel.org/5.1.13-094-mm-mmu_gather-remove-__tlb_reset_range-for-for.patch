Subject: [PATCH] mm: mmu_gather: remove __tlb_reset_range() for force flush
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.13
Git-commit: 7a30df49f63ad92318ddf1f7498d1129a77dd4bd

commit 7a30df49f63ad92318ddf1f7498d1129a77dd4bd upstream.

A few new fields were added to mmu_gather to make TLB flush smarter for
huge page by telling what level of page table is changed.

__tlb_reset_range() is used to reset all these page table state to
unchanged, which is called by TLB flush for parallel mapping changes for
the same range under non-exclusive lock (i.e.  read mmap_sem).

Before commit dd2283f2605e ("mm: mmap: zap pages with read mmap_sem in
munmap"), the syscalls (e.g.  MADV_DONTNEED, MADV_FREE) which may update
PTEs in parallel don't remove page tables.  But, the forementioned
commit may do munmap() under read mmap_sem and free page tables.  This
may result in program hang on aarch64 reported by Jan Stancek.  The
problem could be reproduced by his test program with slightly modified
below.

---8<---

static int map_size = 4096;
static int num_iter = 500;
static long threads_total;

static void *distant_area;

void *map_write_unmap(void *ptr)
{
	int *fd = ptr;
	unsigned char *map_address;
	int i, j = 0;

	for (i = 0; i < num_iter; i++) {
		map_address = mmap(distant_area, (size_t) map_size, PROT_WRITE | PROT_READ,
			MAP_SHARED | MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
		if (map_address == MAP_FAILED) {
			perror("mmap");
			exit(1);
		}

		for (j = 0; j < map_size; j++)
			map_address[j] = 'b';

		if (munmap(map_address, map_size) == -1) {
			perror("munmap");
			exit(1);
		}
	}

	return NULL;
}

void *dummy(void *ptr)
{
	return NULL;
}

int main(void)
{
	pthread_t thid[2];

	/* hint for mmap in map_write_unmap() */
	distant_area = mmap(0, DISTANT_MMAP_SIZE, PROT_WRITE | PROT_READ,
			MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_PRIVATE, -1, 0);
	munmap(distant_area, (size_t)DISTANT_MMAP_SIZE);
	distant_area += DISTANT_MMAP_SIZE / 2;

	while (1) {
		pthread_create(&thid[0], NULL, map_write_unmap, NULL);
		pthread_create(&thid[1], NULL, dummy, NULL);

		pthread_join(thid[0], NULL);
		pthread_join(thid[1], NULL);
	}
}

The program may bring in parallel execution like below:

        t1                                        t2
munmap(map_address)
  downgrade_write(&mm->mmap_sem);
  unmap_region()
  tlb_gather_mmu()
    inc_tlb_flush_pending(tlb->mm);
  free_pgtables()
    tlb->freed_tables = 1
    tlb->cleared_pmds = 1

                                        pthread_exit()
                                        madvise(thread_stack, 8M, MADV_DONTNEED)
                                          zap_page_range()
                                            tlb_gather_mmu()
                                              inc_tlb_flush_pending(tlb->mm);

  tlb_finish_mmu()
    if (mm_tlb_flush_nested(tlb->mm))
      __tlb_reset_range()

__tlb_reset_range() would reset freed_tables and cleared_* bits, but this
may cause inconsistency for munmap() which do free page tables.  Then it
may result in some architectures, e.g.  aarch64, may not flush TLB
completely as expected to have stale TLB entries remained.

Use fullmm flush since it yields much better performance on aarch64 and
non-fullmm doesn't yields significant difference on x86.

The original proposed fix came from Jan Stancek who mainly debugged this
issue, I just wrapped up everything together.

Jan's testing results:
