Subject: [PATCH] csky: fix up lock_mm_and_find_vma() conversion
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.37
Git-commit: e55e5df193d247a38a5e1ac65a5316a0adcc22fa

commit e55e5df193d247a38a5e1ac65a5316a0adcc22fa upstream.

As already mentioned in my merge message for the 'expand-stack' branch,
we have something like 24 different versions of the page fault path for
all our different architectures, all just _slightly_ different due to
various historical reasons (usually related to exactly when they
branched off the original i386 version, and the details of the other
architectures they had in their history).

And a few of them had some silly mistake in the conversion.

Most of the architectures call the faulting address 'address' in the
fault path.  But not all.  Some just call it 'addr'.  And if you end up
doing a bit too much copy-and-paste, you end up with the wrong version
in the places that do it differently.

In this case it was csky.
