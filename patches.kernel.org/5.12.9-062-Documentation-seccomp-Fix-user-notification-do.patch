Subject: [PATCH] Documentation: seccomp: Fix user notification documentation
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.9
Git-commit: aac902925ea646e461c95edc98a8a57eb0def917

commit aac902925ea646e461c95edc98a8a57eb0def917 upstream.

The documentation had some previously incorrect information about how
userspace notifications (and responses) were handled due to a change
from a previously proposed patchset.
