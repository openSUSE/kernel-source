Subject: [PATCH] pmdomain: apple: Add "apple,t8103-pmgr-pwrstate"
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.8
Git-commit: 442816f97a4f84cb321d3359177a3b9b0ce48a60

[ Upstream commit 442816f97a4f84cb321d3359177a3b9b0ce48a60 ]

After discussion with the devicetree maintainers we agreed to not extend
lists with the generic compatible "apple,pmgr-pwrstate" anymore [1]. Use
"apple,t8103-pmgr-pwrstate" as base compatible as it is the SoC the
driver and bindings were written for.
