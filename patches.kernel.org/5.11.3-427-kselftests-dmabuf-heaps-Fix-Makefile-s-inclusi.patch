Subject: [PATCH] kselftests: dmabuf-heaps: Fix Makefile's inclusion of the
 kernel's usr/include dir
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.3
Git-commit: 64ba3d591c9d2be2a9c09e99b00732afe002ad0d

[ Upstream commit 64ba3d591c9d2be2a9c09e99b00732afe002ad0d ]

Copied in from somewhere else, the makefile was including
the kerne's usr/include dir, which caused the asm/ioctl.h file
to be used.

Unfortunately, that file has different values for _IOC_SIZEBITS
and _IOC_WRITE than include/uapi/asm-generic/ioctl.h which then
causes the _IOCW macros to give the wrong ioctl numbers,
specifically for DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC.

This patch simply removes the extra include from the Makefile
