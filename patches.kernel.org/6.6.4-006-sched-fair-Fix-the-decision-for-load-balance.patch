Subject: [PATCH] sched/fair: Fix the decision for load balance
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.4
Git-commit: 6d7e4782bcf549221b4ccfffec2cf4d1a473f1a3

[ Upstream commit 6d7e4782bcf549221b4ccfffec2cf4d1a473f1a3 ]

should_we_balance is called for the decision to do load-balancing.
When sched ticks invoke this function, only one CPU should return
true. However, in the current code, two CPUs can return true. The
following situation, where b means busy and i means idle, is an
example, because CPU 0 and CPU 2 return true.

        [0, 1] [2, 3]
         b  b   i  b

This fix checks if there exists an idle CPU with busy sibling(s)
after looking for a CPU on an idle core. If some idle CPUs with busy
siblings are found, just the first one should do load-balancing.
