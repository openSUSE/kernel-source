Subject: [PATCH] bpf: Fix libelf endian handling in resolv_btfids
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.2
Git-commit: 61e8aeda9398925f8c6fc290585bdd9727d154c4

[ Upstream commit 61e8aeda9398925f8c6fc290585bdd9727d154c4 ]

The vmlinux ".BTF_ids" ELF section is declared in btf_ids.h to hold a list
of zero-filled BTF IDs, which is then patched at link-time with correct
values by resolv_btfids. The section is flagged as "allocable" to preclude
compression, but notably the section contents (BTF IDs) are untyped.

When patching the BTF IDs, resolve_btfids writes in host-native endianness
and relies on libelf for any required translation on reading and updating
vmlinux. However, since the type of the .BTF_ids section content defaults
to ELF_T_BYTE (i.e. unsigned char), no translation occurs. This results in
incorrect patched values when cross-compiling to non-native endianness,
and can manifest as kernel Oops and test failures which are difficult to
troubleshoot [1].

Explicitly set the type of patched data to ELF_T_WORD, the architecture-
neutral ELF type corresponding to the u32 BTF IDs. This enables libelf to
transparently perform any needed endian conversions.

Fixes: fbbb68de80a4 ("bpf: Add resolve_btfids tool to resolve BTF IDs in ELF object")
