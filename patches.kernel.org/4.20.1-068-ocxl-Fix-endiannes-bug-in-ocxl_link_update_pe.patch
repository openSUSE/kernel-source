Subject: [PATCH] ocxl: Fix endiannes bug in ocxl_link_update_pe()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.1
Git-commit: e1e71e201703500f708bdeaf64660a2a178cb6a0

commit e1e71e201703500f708bdeaf64660a2a178cb6a0 upstream.

All fields in the PE are big-endian. Use cpu_to_be32() like everywhere
else something is written to the PE. Otherwise a wrong TID will be used
by the NPU. If this TID happens to point to an existing thread sharing
the same mm, it could be woken up by error. This is highly improbable
though. The likely outcome of this is the NPU not finding the target
thread and forcing the AFU into sending an interrupt, which userspace
is supposed to handle anyway.
