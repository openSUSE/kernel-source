Subject: [PATCH] fs: dlm: fix debugfs dump
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.5
Git-commit: 92c48950b43f4a767388cf87709d8687151a641f

[ Upstream commit 92c48950b43f4a767388cf87709d8687151a641f ]

This patch fixes the following message which randomly pops up during
glocktop call:

seq_file: buggy .next function table_seq_next did not update position index

The issue is that seq_read_iter() in fs/seq_file.c also needs an
increment of the index in an non next record case as well which this
patch fixes otherwise seq_read_iter() will print out the above message.
