Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: compress: Don't allow paritial drain operations on
 capture streams
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.9
Git-commit: a70ab8a8645083f3700814e757f2940a88b7ef88

[ Upstream commit a70ab8a8645083f3700814e757f2940a88b7ef88 ]

Partial drain and next track are intended for gapless playback and
don't really have an obvious interpretation for a capture stream, so
makes sense to not allow those operations on capture streams.
