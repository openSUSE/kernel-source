[ Upstream commit 09a45a5553792bbf20beba0a1ac90b4692324d06 ]

The MPTCP port attribute is in host endianness, but was documented
as big-endian in the ynl specification.

Below are two examples from net/mptcp/pm_netlink.c showing that the
attribute is converted to/from host endianness for use with netlink.

Import from netlink:
  addr->port = htons(nla_get_u16(tb[MPTCP_PM_ADDR_ATTR_PORT]))

Export to netlink:
  nla_put_u16(skb, MPTCP_PM_ADDR_ATTR_PORT, ntohs(addr->port))

Where addr->port is defined as __be16.

No functional change intended.
