Subject: [PATCH] MIPS: Validate PR_SET_FP_MODE prctl(2) requests against the
 ABI of the task
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.14
Git-commit: b67336eee3fcb8ecedc6c13e2bf88aacfa3151e2

commit b67336eee3fcb8ecedc6c13e2bf88aacfa3151e2 upstream.

Fix an API loophole introduced with commit 9791554b45a2 ("MIPS,prctl:
add PR_[GS]ET_FP_MODE prctl options for MIPS"), where the caller of
prctl(2) is incorrectly allowed to make a change to CP0.Status.FR or
CP0.Config5.FRE register bits even if CONFIG_MIPS_O32_FP64_SUPPORT has
not been enabled, despite that an executable requesting the mode
requested via ELF file annotation would not be allowed to run in the
first place, or for n64 and n64 ABI tasks which do not have non-default
modes defined at all.  Add suitable checks to `mips_set_process_fp_mode'
and bail out if an invalid mode change has been requested for the ABI in
effect, even if the FPU hardware or emulation would otherwise allow it.

Always succeed however without taking any further action if the mode
requested is the same as one already in effect, regardless of whether
any mode change, should it be requested, would actually be allowed for
the task concerned.
