Subject: [PATCH] KVM: VMX: simplify and fix vmx_vcpu_pi_load
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.13.5
Git-commit: 31afb2ea2b10a7d17ce3db4cdb0a12b63b2fe08a

commit 31afb2ea2b10a7d17ce3db4cdb0a12b63b2fe08a upstream.

The simplify part: do not touch pi_desc.nv, we can set it when the
VCPU is first created.  Likewise, pi_desc.sn is only handled by
vmx_vcpu_pi_load, do not touch it in __pi_post_block.

The fix part: do not check kvm_arch_has_assigned_device, instead
check the SN bit to figure out whether vmx_vcpu_pi_put ran before.
This matches what the previous patch did in pi_post_block.
