Subject: [PATCH] x86/pkeys: Manually set X86_FEATURE_OSPKE to preserve
 existing changes
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.9
Git-commit: 735a6dd02222d8d070c7bb748f25895239ca8c92

commit 735a6dd02222d8d070c7bb748f25895239ca8c92 upstream.

Explicitly set X86_FEATURE_OSPKE via set_cpu_cap() instead of calling
get_cpu_cap() to pull the feature bit from CPUID after enabling CR4.PKE.
Invoking get_cpu_cap() effectively wipes out any {set,clear}_cpu_cap()
changes that were made between this_cpu->c_init() and setup_pku(), as
all non-synthetic feature words are reinitialized from the CPU's CPUID
values.

Blasting away capability updates manifests most visibility when running
on a VMX capable CPU, but with VMX disabled by BIOS.  To indicate that
VMX is disabled, init_ia32_feat_ctl() clears X86_FEATURE_VMX, using
clear_cpu_cap() instead of setup_clear_cpu_cap() so that KVM can report
which CPU is misconfigured (KVM needs to probe every CPU anyways).
Restoring X86_FEATURE_VMX from CPUID causes KVM to think VMX is enabled,
ultimately leading to an unexpected #GP when KVM attempts to do VMXON.

Arguably, init_ia32_feat_ctl() should use setup_clear_cpu_cap() and let
KVM figure out a different way to report the misconfigured CPU, but VMX
is not the only feature bit that is affected, i.e. there is precedent
that tweaking feature bits via {set,clear}_cpu_cap() after ->c_init()
is expected to work.  Most notably, x86_init_rdrand()'s clearing of
X86_FEATURE_RDRAND when RDRAND malfunctions is also overwritten.
