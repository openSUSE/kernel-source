Subject: [PATCH] badblocks: attempt to merge adjacent badblocks during
 ack_all_badblocks
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.2
Git-commit: 32e9ad4d11f69949ff331e35a417871ee0d31d99

[ Upstream commit 32e9ad4d11f69949ff331e35a417871ee0d31d99 ]

If ack and unack badblocks are adjacent, they will not be merged and will
remain as two separate badblocks. Even after the bad blocks are written
to disk and both become ack, they will still remain as two independent
bad blocks. This is not ideal as it wastes the limited space for
badblocks. Therefore, during ack_all_badblocks(), attempt to merge
badblocks if they are adjacent.
