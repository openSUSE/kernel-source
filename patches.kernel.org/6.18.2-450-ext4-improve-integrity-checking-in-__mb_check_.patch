Subject: [PATCH] ext4: improve integrity checking in __mb_check_buddy by
 enhancing order-0 validation
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.2
Git-commit: d9ee3ff810f1cc0e253c9f2b17b668b973cb0e06

[ Upstream commit d9ee3ff810f1cc0e253c9f2b17b668b973cb0e06 ]

When the MB_CHECK_ASSERT macro is enabled, we found that the
current validation logic in __mb_check_buddy has a gap in
detecting certain invalid buddy states, particularly related
to order-0 (bitmap) bits.

The original logic consists of three steps:
1. Validates higher-order buddies: if a higher-order bit is
set, at most one of the two corresponding lower-order bits
may be free; if a higher-order bit is clear, both lower-order
bits must be allocated (and their bitmap bits must be 0).
2. For any set bit in order-0, ensures all corresponding
higher-order bits are not free.
3. Verifies that all preallocated blocks (pa) in the group
have pa_pstart within bounds and their bitmap bits marked as
allocated.

However, this approach fails to properly validate cases where
order-0 bits are incorrectly cleared (0), allowing some invalid
configurations to pass:

               corrupt            integral

order 3           1                  1
order 2       1       1          1       1
order 1     1   1   1   1      1   1   1   1
order 0    0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Here we get two adjacent free blocks at order-0 with inconsistent
higher-order state, and the right one shows the correct scenario.

The root cause is insufficient validation of order-0 zero bits.
To fix this and improve completeness without significant performance
cost, we refine the logic:

1. Maintain the top-down higher-order validation, but we no longer
check the cases where the higher-order bit is 0, as this case will
be covered in step 2.
2. Enhance order-0 checking by examining pairs of bits:
   - If either bit in a pair is set (1), all corresponding
     higher-order bits must not be free.
   - If both bits are clear (0), then exactly one of the
     corresponding higher-order bits must be free
3. Keep the preallocation (pa) validation unchanged.

This change closes the validation gap, ensuring illegal buddy states
involving order-0 are correctly detected, while removing redundant
checks and maintaining efficiency.
