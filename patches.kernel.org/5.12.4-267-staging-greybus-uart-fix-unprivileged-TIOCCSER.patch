Subject: [PATCH] staging: greybus: uart: fix unprivileged TIOCCSERIAL
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.4
Git-commit: 60c6b305c11b5fd167ce5e2ce42f3a9098c388f0

[ Upstream commit 60c6b305c11b5fd167ce5e2ce42f3a9098c388f0 ]

TIOCSSERIAL is a horrid, underspecified, legacy interface which for most
serial devices is only useful for setting the close_delay and
closing_wait parameters.

A non-privileged user has only ever been able to set the since long
deprecated ASYNC_SPD flags and trying to change any other *supported*
feature should result in -EPERM being returned. Setting the current
values for any supported features should return success.

Fix the greybus implementation which instead indicated that the
TIOCSSERIAL ioctl was not even implemented when a non-privileged user
set the current values.
