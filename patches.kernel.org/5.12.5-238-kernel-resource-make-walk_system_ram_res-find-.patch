[ Upstream commit 97f61c8f44ec9020708b97a51188170add4f3084 ]

Patch series "kernel/resource: make walk_system_ram_res() and walk_mem_res() search the whole tree", v2.

Playing with kdump+virtio-mem I noticed that kexec_file_load() does not
consider System RAM added via dax/kmem and virtio-mem when preparing the
elf header for kdump.  Looking into the details, the logic used in
walk_system_ram_res() and walk_mem_res() seems to be outdated.

walk_system_ram_range() already does the right thing, let's change
walk_system_ram_res() and walk_mem_res(), and clean up.

Loading a kdump kernel via "kexec -p -s" ...  will result in the kdump
kernel to also dump dax/kmem and virtio-mem added System RAM now.

Note: kexec-tools on x86-64 also have to be updated to consider this
memory in the kexec_load() case when processing /proc/iomem.

This patch (of 3):

It used to be true that we can have system RAM (IORESOURCE_SYSTEM_RAM |
IORESOURCE_BUSY) only on the first level in the resource tree.  However,
this is no longer holds for driver-managed system RAM (i.e., added via
dax/kmem and virtio-mem), which gets added on lower levels, for example,
inside device containers.

We have two users of walk_system_ram_res(), which currently only
consideres the first level:

a) kernel/kexec_file.c:kexec_walk_resources() -- We properly skip
   IORESOURCE_SYSRAM_DRIVER_MANAGED resources via
   locate_mem_hole_callback(), so even after this change, we won't be
   placing kexec images onto dax/kmem and virtio-mem added memory.  No
   change.

b) arch/x86/kernel/crash.c:fill_up_crash_elf_data() -- we're currently
   not adding relevant ranges to the crash elf header, resulting in them
   not getting dumped via kdump.

This change fixes loading a crashkernel via kexec_file_load() and
including dax/kmem and virtio-mem added System RAM in the crashdump on
x86-64.  Note that e.g,, arm64 relies on memblock data and, therefore,
always considers all added System RAM already.

Let's find all IORESOURCE_SYSTEM_RAM | IORESOURCE_BUSY resources, making
the function behave like walk_system_ram_range().
