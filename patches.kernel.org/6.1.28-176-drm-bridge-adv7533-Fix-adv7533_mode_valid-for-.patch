Subject: [PATCH] drm/bridge: adv7533: Fix adv7533_mode_valid for adv7533 and
 adv7535
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.28
Git-commit: ee0285e13455fdbce5de315bdbe91b5f198a2a06

[ Upstream commit ee0285e13455fdbce5de315bdbe91b5f198a2a06 ]

When dynamically switching lanes was removed, the intent of the code
was to check to make sure that higher speed items used 4 lanes, but
it had the unintended consequence of removing the slower speeds for
4-lane users.

This attempts to remedy this by doing a check to see that the
max frequency doesn't exceed the chip limit, and a second
check to make sure that the max bit-rate doesn't exceed the
number of lanes * max bit rate / lane.
