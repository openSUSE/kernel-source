Subject: [PATCH] drm: tidss: Fix pixel format definition
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: 2df0433b18f2735a49d2c3a968b40fa2881137c0

[ Upstream commit 2df0433b18f2735a49d2c3a968b40fa2881137c0 ]

There was a long-standing bug from a typo that created 2 ARGB1555 and
ABGR1555 pixel format entries. Weston 10 has a sanity check that alerted
me to this issue.

According to the Supported Pixel Data formats table we have the later
entries should have been for Alpha-X instead.
