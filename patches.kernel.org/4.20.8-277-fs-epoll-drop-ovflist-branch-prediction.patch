Subject: [PATCH] fs/epoll: drop ovflist branch prediction
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.8
Git-commit: 76699a67f3041ff4c7af6d6ee9be2bfbf1ffb671

[ Upstream commit 76699a67f3041ff4c7af6d6ee9be2bfbf1ffb671 ]

The ep->ovflist is a secondary ready-list to temporarily store events
that might occur when doing sproc without holding the ep->wq.lock.  This
accounts for every time we check for ready events and also send events
back to userspace; both callbacks, particularly the latter because of
copy_to_user, can account for a non-trivial time.

As such, the unlikely() check to see if the pointer is being used, seems
both misleading and sub-optimal.  In fact, we go to an awful lot of
trouble to sync both lists, and populating the ovflist is far from an
uncommon scenario.

For example, profiling a concurrent epoll_wait(2) benchmark, with
CONFIG_PROFILE_ANNOTATED_BRANCHES shows that for a two threads a 33%
incorrect rate was seen; and when incrementally increasing the number of
epoll instances (which is used, for example for multiple queuing load
balancing models), up to a 90% incorrect rate was seen.

Similarly, by deleting the prediction, 3% throughput boost was seen
across incremental threads.
