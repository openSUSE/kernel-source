[ Upstream commit 590c03ca6a3fbb114396673314e2aa483839608b ]

Patch series "ksm: fix exec/fork inheritance", v2.

This series fixes exec/fork inheritance.  See the detailed description of
the issue below.

This patch (of 2):

Background
==========

commit d7597f59d1d33 ("mm: add new api to enable ksm per process")
introduced MMF_VM_MERGE_ANY for mm->flags, and allowed user to set it by
prctl() so that the process's VMAs are forcibly scanned by ksmd.

Subsequently, the 3c6f33b7273a ("mm/ksm: support fork/exec for prctl")
supported inheriting the MMF_VM_MERGE_ANY flag when a task calls execve().

Finally, commit 3a9e567ca45fb ("mm/ksm: fix ksm exec support for prctl")
fixed the issue that ksmd doesn't scan the mm_struct with MMF_VM_MERGE_ANY
by adding the mm_slot to ksm_mm_head in __bprm_mm_init().

Problem
=======

In some extreme scenarios, however, this inheritance of MMF_VM_MERGE_ANY
during exec/fork can fail.  For example, when the scanning frequency of
ksmd is tuned extremely high, a process carrying MMF_VM_MERGE_ANY may
still fail to pass it to the newly exec'd process.  This happens because
ksm_execve() is executed too early in the do_execve flow (prematurely
adding the new mm_struct to the ksm_mm_slot list).

As a result, before do_execve completes, ksmd may have already performed a
scan and found that this new mm_struct has no VM_MERGEABLE VMAs, thus
clearing its MMF_VM_MERGE_ANY flag.  Consequently, when the new program
executes, the flag MMF_VM_MERGE_ANY inheritance missed.

Root reason
===========

commit d7597f59d1d33 ("mm: add new api to enable ksm per process") clear
the flag MMF_VM_MERGE_ANY when ksmd found no VM_MERGEABLE VMAs.

Solution
========

Firstly, Don't clear MMF_VM_MERGE_ANY when ksmd found no VM_MERGEABLE
VMAs, because perhaps their mm_struct has just been added to ksm_mm_slot
list, and its process has not yet officially started running or has not
yet performed mmap/brk to allocate anonymous VMAS.

Secondly, recheck MMF_VM_MERGEABLE again if a process takes
MMF_VM_MERGE_ANY, and create a mm_slot and join it into ksm_scan_list
again.
