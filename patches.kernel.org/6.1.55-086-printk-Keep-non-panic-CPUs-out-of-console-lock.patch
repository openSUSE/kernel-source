Subject: [PATCH] printk: Keep non-panic-CPUs out of console lock
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.55
Git-commit: 51a1d258e50e03a0216bf42b6af9ff34ec402ac1

[ Upstream commit 51a1d258e50e03a0216bf42b6af9ff34ec402ac1 ]

When in a panic situation, non-panic CPUs should avoid holding the
console lock so as not to contend with the panic CPU. This is already
implemented with abandon_console_lock_in_panic(), which is checked
after each printed line. However, non-panic CPUs should also avoid
trying to acquire the console lock during a panic.

Modify console_trylock() to fail and console_lock() to block() when
called from a non-panic CPU during a panic.
