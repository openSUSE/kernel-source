Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx7d-pico: Fix the 'tuning-step' property
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.10
Git-commit: 0e2fa4959c4f44815ce33e46e4054eeb0f346053

[ Upstream commit 0e2fa4959c4f44815ce33e46e4054eeb0f346053 ]

According to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mmc/fsl-imx-esdhc.yaml, the
correct name of the property is 'fsl,tuning-step'.

Fix it accordingly.
