Subject: [PATCH] fsverity: Remove WQ_UNBOUND from fsverity read workqueue
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.22
Git-commit: f959325e6ac3f499450088b8d9c626d1177be160

commit f959325e6ac3f499450088b8d9c626d1177be160 upstream.

WQ_UNBOUND causes significant scheduler latency on ARM64/Android.  This
is problematic for latency sensitive workloads, like I/O
post-processing.

Removing WQ_UNBOUND gives a 96% reduction in fsverity workqueue related
scheduler latency and improves app cold startup times by ~30ms.
WQ_UNBOUND was also removed from the dm-verity workqueue for the same
reason [1].

This code was tested by running Android app startup benchmarks and
measuring how long the fsverity workqueue spent in the runnable state.

Before
Total workqueue scheduler latency: 553800us
After
Total workqueue scheduler latency: 18962us
