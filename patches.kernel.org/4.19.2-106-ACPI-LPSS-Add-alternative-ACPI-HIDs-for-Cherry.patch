Subject: [PATCH] ACPI / LPSS: Add alternative ACPI HIDs for Cherry Trail DMA
 controllers
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.2
Git-commit: 240714061c58e6b1abfb3322398a7634151c06cb

[ Upstream commit 240714061c58e6b1abfb3322398a7634151c06cb ]

Bay and Cherry Trail DSTDs represent a different set of devices depending
on which OS the device think it is booting. One set of decices for Windows
and another set of devices for Android which targets the Android-x86 Linux
kernel fork (which e.g. used to have its own display driver instead of
using the i915 driver).

Which set of devices we are actually going to get is out of our control,
this is controlled by the ACPI OSID variable, which gets either set through
an EFI setup option, or sometimes is autodetected. So we need to support
both.

This commit adds support for the 80862286 and 808622C0 ACPI HIDs which we
get for the first resp. second DMA controller on Cherry Trail devices when
OSID is set to Android.
