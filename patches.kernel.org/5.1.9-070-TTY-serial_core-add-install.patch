Subject: [PATCH] TTY: serial_core, add ->install
Patch-mainline: 5.1.9
References: bnc#1012628 bnc#1129693
Git-commit: 4cdd17ba1dff20ffc99fdbd2e6f0201fc7fe67df

commit 4cdd17ba1dff20ffc99fdbd2e6f0201fc7fe67df upstream.

We need to compute the uart state only on the first open. This is
usually what is done in the ->install hook. serial_core used to do this
in ->open on every open. So move it to ->install.

As a side effect, it ensures the state is set properly in the window
after tty_init_dev is called, but before uart_open. This fixes a bunch
of races between tty_open and flush_to_ldisc we were dealing with
recently.

One of such bugs was attempted to fix in commit fedb5760648a (serial:
fix race between flush_to_ldisc and tty_open), but it only took care of
a couple of functions (uart_start and uart_unthrottle).  I was able to
reproduce the crash on a SLE system, but in uart_write_room which is
also called from flush_to_ldisc via process_echoes. I was *unable* to
reproduce the bug locally. It is due to having this patch in my queue
since 2012!

0 in rbx means tty->driver_data is NULL in uart_write_room. 0x178 is
tried to be dereferenced (0x178 >> 3 is 0x2f in rdx) at
uart_write_room+0xc4. 0x178 is exactly (struct uart_state *)NULL->refcount
used in uart_port_lock from uart_write_room.

So revert the upstream commit here as my local patch should fix the
whole family.
