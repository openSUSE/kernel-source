Subject: [PATCH] regulator: wm831x ldo: Fix notifier mutex lock warning
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.6
Git-commit: 8be64b6d87bd47d81753b60ddafe70102ebfd76b

[ Upstream commit 8be64b6d87bd47d81753b60ddafe70102ebfd76b ]

The mutex for the regulator_dev must be controlled by the caller of
the regulator_notifier_call_chain(), as described in the comment
for that function.

Failure to mutex lock and unlock surrounding the notifier call results
in a kernel WARN_ON_ONCE() which will dump a backtrace for the
regulator_notifier_call_chain() when that function call is first made.
The mutex can be controlled using the regulator_lock/unlock() API.
