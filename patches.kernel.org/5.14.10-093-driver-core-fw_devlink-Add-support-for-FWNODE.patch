Subject: [PATCH] driver core: fw_devlink: Add support for
 FWNODE_FLAG_NEEDS_CHILD_BOUND_ON_ADD
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.10
Git-commit: 5501765a02a6c324f78581e6bb8209d054fe13ae

[ Upstream commit 5501765a02a6c324f78581e6bb8209d054fe13ae ]

If a parent device is also a supplier to a child device, fw_devlink=on by
design delays the probe() of the child device until the probe() of the
parent finishes successfully.

However, some drivers of such parent devices (where parent is also a
supplier) expect the child device to finish probing successfully as soon as
they are added using device_add() and before the probe() of the parent
device has completed successfully. One example of such a case is discussed
in the link mentioned below.

Add a flag to make fw_devlink=on not enforce these supplier-consumer
relationships, so these drivers can continue working.
