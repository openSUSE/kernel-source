Subject: [PATCH] usb: pci-quirks.c: Corrected timeout values used in handshake
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.13.6
Git-commit: 114ec3a6f9096d211a4aff4277793ba969a62c73

commit 114ec3a6f9096d211a4aff4277793ba969a62c73 upstream.

Servers were emitting failed handoff messages but were not
waiting the full 1 second as designated in section 4.22.1 of
the eXtensible Host Controller Interface specifications. The
handshake was using wrong units so calls were made with milliseconds
not microseconds. Comments referenced 5 seconds not 1 second as
in specs.

The wrong units were also corrected in a second handshake call.
