Subject: [PATCH] ACPICA: AML Parser: ignore dispatcher error status during
 table load
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.11
Git-commit: 73c2a01c52b657f4a0ead6c95f64c5279efbd000

commit 73c2a01c52b657f4a0ead6c95f64c5279efbd000 upstream.

The dispatcher and the executer process the parse nodes During table
load. Error status from the evaluation confuses the AML parser. This
results in the parser failing to complete parsing of the current
scope op which becomes problematic. For the incorrect AML below, _ADR
never gets created.

definition_block(...)
{
   Scope (\_SB)
   {
     Device (PCI0){...}
     Name (OBJ1, 0x0)
     OBJ1 = PCI0 + 5 // Results in an operand error.
   } // \_SB not closed

   // parser looks for \_SB._SB.PCI0, results in AE_NOT_FOUND error
   // Entire scope block gets skipped.
   Scope (\_SB.PCI0)
   {
       Name (_ADR, 0x0)
   }
}

Fix the above error by properly completing the initial \_SB scope
after an error by clearing errors that occur during table load. In
the above case, this means that OBJ1 = PIC0 + 5 is skipped.
