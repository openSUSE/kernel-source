Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: dt-bindings: lpass: Fix and common up lpass dai ids
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.13
Git-commit: 09a4f6f5d21cb1f2633f4e8b893336b60eee9a01

[ Upstream commit 09a4f6f5d21cb1f2633f4e8b893336b60eee9a01 ]

Existing header file design of having separate SoC specific header files
for the common lpass driver has mutiple issues.
This design is prone to break as an when new SoC header is added
as the common DAI ids of other SoCs will be overwritten by the
new ones.

One of them surfaced by recent patch that adds support to sc7180, this
one totally broke LPASS drivers on other Qualcomm SoCs.

Before this gets worst, fix this by having a common header qcom,lpass.h.
This should fix the issue and any new DAI ids should be added to the
common header. This will be more sustainable then the existing design!
