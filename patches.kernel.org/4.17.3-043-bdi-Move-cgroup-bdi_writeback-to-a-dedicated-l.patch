cgwb_release() punts the actual release to cgwb_release_workfn() on
system_wq.  Depending on the number of cgroups or block devices, there
can be a lot of cgwb_release_workfn() in flight at the same time.

We're periodically seeing close to 256 kworkers getting stuck with the
following stack trace and overtime the entire system gets stuck.

  [<ffffffff810ee40c>] _synchronize_rcu_expedited.constprop.72+0x2fc/0x330
  [<ffffffff810ee634>] synchronize_rcu_expedited+0x24/0x30

  [<ffffffff811cd1e9>] release_bdi+0x89/0xc0
  [<ffffffff811cd645>] wb_exit+0x85/0xa0
  [<ffffffff811cdc84>] cgwb_release_workfn+0x54/0xb0
  [<ffffffff810a68d0>] process_one_work+0x150/0x410
  [<ffffffff810a71fd>] worker_thread+0x6d/0x520
  [<ffffffff810ad3dc>] kthread+0x12c/0x160
  [<ffffffff81969019>] ret_from_fork+0x29/0x40
  [<ffffffffffffffff>] 0xffffffffffffffff

The events leading to the lockup are...

1. A lot of cgwb_release_workfn() is queued at the same time and all
   system_wq kworkers are assigned to execute them.

2. They all end up calling synchronize_rcu_expedited().  One of them
   wins and tries to perform the expedited synchronization.

3. However, that invovles queueing rcu_exp_work to system_wq and
   waiting for it.  Because #1 is holding all available kworkers on
   system_wq, rcu_exp_work can't be executed.  cgwb_release_workfn()
   is waiting for synchronize_rcu_expedited() which in turn is waiting
   for cgwb_release_workfn() to free up some of the kworkers.

We shouldn't be scheduling hundreds of cgwb_release_workfn() at the
same time.  There's nothing to be gained from that.  This patch
updates cgwb release path to use a dedicated percpu workqueue with
@max_active of 1.

While this resolves the problem at hand, it might be a good idea to
isolate rcu_exp_work to its own workqueue too as it can be used from
various paths and is prone to this sort of indirect A-A deadlocks.
