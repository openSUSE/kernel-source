Subject: [PATCH] kbuild: modversions: Fix relative CRC byte order
 interpretation
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.6
Git-commit: 54a7151b1496cddbb7a83546b7998103e98edc88

commit 54a7151b1496cddbb7a83546b7998103e98edc88 upstream.

Fix commit 56067812d5b0 ("kbuild: modversions: add infrastructure for
emitting relative CRCs") where CRCs are interpreted in host byte order
rather than proper kernel byte order. The bug is conditional on
CONFIG_MODULE_REL_CRCS.

For example, when loading a BE module into a BE kernel compiled with a LE
system, the error "disagrees about version of symbol module_layout" is
produced. A message such as "Found checksum D7FA6856 vs module 5668FAD7"
will be given with debug enabled, which indicates an obvious endian
problem within __kcrctab within the kernel image.

The general solution is to use the macro TO_NATIVE, as is done in
similar cases throughout modpost.c. With this correction it has been
verified that a BE kernel compiled with a LE system accepts BE modules.

This change has also been verified with a LE kernel compiled with a LE
system, in which case TO_NATIVE returns its value unmodified since the
byte orders match. This is by far the common case.
