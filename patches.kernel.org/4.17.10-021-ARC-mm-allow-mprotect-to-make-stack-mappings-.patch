Subject: [PATCH] ARC: mm: allow mprotect to make stack mappings executable
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.10
Git-commit: 93312b6da4df31e4102ce5420e6217135a16c7ea

commit 93312b6da4df31e4102ce5420e6217135a16c7ea upstream.

mprotect(EXEC) was failing for stack mappings as default vm flags was
missing MAYEXEC.

This was triggered by glibc test suite nptl/tst-execstack testcase

What is surprising is that despite running LTP for years on, we didn't
catch this issue as it lacks a directed test case.

gcc dejagnu tests with nested functions also requiring exec stack work
fine though because they rely on the GNU_STACK segment spit out by
compiler and handled in kernel elf loader.

This glibc case is different as the stack is non exec to begin with and
a dlopen of shared lib with GNU_STACK segment triggers the exec stack
proceedings using a mprotect(PROT_EXEC) which was broken.
