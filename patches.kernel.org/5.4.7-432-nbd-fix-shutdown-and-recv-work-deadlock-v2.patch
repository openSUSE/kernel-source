    nbd: fix max number of supported devs

where we can deadlock during device shutdown. The problem occurs if
the recv_work's nbd_config_put occurs after nbd_start_device_ioctl has
returned and the userspace app has droppped its reference via closing
the device and running nbd_release. The recv_work nbd_config_put call
would then drop the refcount to zero and try to destroy the config which
would try to do destroy_workqueue from the recv work.

This patch just has nbd_start_device_ioctl do a flush_workqueue when it
wakes so we know after the ioctl returns running works have exited. This
also fixes a possible race where we could try to reuse the device while
old recv_works are still running.
