commit 00312419f0863964625d6dcda8183f96849412c6 upstream.

On systems using the hash MMU, there is a software SLB preload cache that
mirrors the entries loaded into the hardware SLB buffer. This preload
cache is subject to periodic eviction — typically after every 256 context
switches — to remove old entry.

To optimize performance, the kernel skips switch_mmu_context() in
switch_mm_irqs_off() when the prev and next mm_struct are the same.
However, on hash MMU systems, this can lead to inconsistencies between
the hardware SLB and the software preload cache.

If an SLB entry for a process is evicted from the software cache on one
CPU, and the same process later runs on another CPU without executing
switch_mmu_context(), the hardware SLB may retain stale entries. If the
kernel then attempts to reload that entry, it can trigger an SLB
multi-hit error.

The following timeline shows how stale SLB entries are created and can
cause a multi-hit error when a process moves between CPUs without a
MMU context switch.

>From the above analysis, during early exec the hardware SLB is cleared,
and entries from the software preload cache are reloaded into hardware
by switch_slb. However, preload_new_slb_context and slb_setup_new_exec
also attempt to load some of the same entries, which can trigger a
multi-hit. In most cases, these additional preloads simply hit existing
entries and add nothing new. Removing these functions avoids redundant
preloads and eliminates the multi-hit issue. This patch removes these
two functions.

We tested process switching performance using the context_switch
benchmark on POWER9/hash, and observed no regression.

Without this patch: 129041 ops/sec
With this patch:    129341 ops/sec

We also measured SLB faults during boot, and the counts are essentially
the same with and without this patch.

SLB faults without this patch: 19727
SLB faults with this patch:    19786
