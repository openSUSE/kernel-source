Subject: [PATCH] bpf: Fix [::] -> [::1] rewrite in sys_sendmsg
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.13
Git-commit: e8e36984080b55ac5e57bdb09a5b570f2fc8e963

[ Upstream commit e8e36984080b55ac5e57bdb09a5b570f2fc8e963 ]

sys_sendmsg has supported unspecified destination IPv6 (wildcard) for
unconnected UDP sockets since 876c7f41. When [::] is passed by user as
destination, sys_sendmsg rewrites it with [::1] to be consistent with
BSD (see "BSD'ism" comment in the code).

This didn't work when cgroup-bpf was enabled though since the rewrite
[::] -> [::1] happened before passing control to cgroup-bpf block where
fl6.daddr was updated with passed by user sockaddr_in6.sin6_addr (that
might or might not be changed by BPF program). That way if user passed
[::] as dst IPv6 it was first rewritten with [::1] by original code from
876c7f41, but then rewritten back with [::] by cgroup-bpf block.

It happened even when BPF_CGROUP_UDP6_SENDMSG program was not present
(CONFIG_CGROUP_BPF=y was enough).

The fix is to apply BSD'ism after cgroup-bpf block so that [::] is
replaced with [::1] no matter where it came from: passed by user to
sys_sendmsg or set by BPF_CGROUP_UDP6_SENDMSG program.
