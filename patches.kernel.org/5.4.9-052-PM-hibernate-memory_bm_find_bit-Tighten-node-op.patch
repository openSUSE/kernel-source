Subject: [PATCH] PM / hibernate: memory_bm_find_bit(): Tighten node
 optimisation
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.9
Git-commit: da6043fe85eb5ec621e34a92540735dcebbea134

[ Upstream commit da6043fe85eb5ec621e34a92540735dcebbea134 ]

When looking for a bit by number we make use of the cached result from the
preceding lookup to speed up operation.  Firstly we check if the requested
pfn is within the cached zone and if not lookup the new zone.  We then
check if the offset for that pfn falls within the existing cached node.
This happens regardless of whether the node is within the zone we are
now scanning.  With certain memory layouts it is possible for this to
false trigger creating a temporary alias for the pfn to a different bit.
This leads the hibernation code to free memory which it was never allocated
with the expected fallout.

Ensure the zone we are scanning matches the cached zone before considering
the cached node.

Deep thanks go to Andrea for many, many, many hours of hacking and testing
that went into cornering this bug.
