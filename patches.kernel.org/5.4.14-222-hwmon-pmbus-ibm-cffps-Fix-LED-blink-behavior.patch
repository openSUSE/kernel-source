Subject: [PATCH] hwmon: (pmbus/ibm-cffps) Fix LED blink behavior
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.14
Git-commit: 92b39ad440968bab38eb6577d63c12994601ed94

commit 92b39ad440968bab38eb6577d63c12994601ed94 upstream.

The LED blink_set function incorrectly did not tell the PSU LED to blink
if brightness was LED_OFF. Fix this, and also correct the LED_OFF
command data, which should give control of the LED back to the PSU
firmware. Also prevent I2C failures from getting the driver LED state
out of sync and add some dev_dbg statements.
