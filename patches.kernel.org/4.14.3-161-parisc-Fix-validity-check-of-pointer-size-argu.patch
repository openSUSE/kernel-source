Subject: [PATCH] parisc: Fix validity check of pointer size argument in new
 CAS implementation
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.3
Git-commit: 05f016d2ca7a4fab99d5d5472168506ddf95e74f

commit 05f016d2ca7a4fab99d5d5472168506ddf95e74f upstream.

As noted by Christoph Biedl, passing a pointer size of 4 in the new CAS
implementation causes a kernel crash.  The attached patch corrects the
off by one error in the argument validity check.

In reviewing the code, I noticed that we only perform word operations
with the pointer size argument.  The subi instruction intentionally uses
a word condition on 64-bit kernels.  Nullification was used instead of a
cmpib instruction as the branch should never be taken.  The shlw
pseudo-operation generates a depw,z instruction and it clears the target
before doing a shift left word deposit.  Thus, we don't need to clip the
upper 32 bits of this argument on 64-bit kernels.

Tested with a gcc testsuite run with a 64-bit kernel.  The gcc atomic
code in libgcc is the only direct user of the new CAS implementation
that I am aware of.
