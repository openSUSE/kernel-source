Subject: [PATCH] coresight: Do not scan for graph if none is present
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.5
Git-commit: 2b921b671a8d29c2adb255a86409aad1e3267309

[ Upstream commit 2b921b671a8d29c2adb255a86409aad1e3267309 ]

If a graph node is not found for a given node, of_get_next_endpoint()
will emit the following error message :

 OF: graph: no port node found in /<node_name>

If the given component doesn't have any explicit connections (e.g,
ETE) we could simply ignore the graph parsing. As for any legacy
component where this is mandatory, the device will not be usable
as before this patch. Updating the DT bindings to Yaml and enabling
the schema checks can detect such issues with the DT.
