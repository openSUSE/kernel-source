Subject: [PATCH] erofs: fix memory leak on short-lived bounced pages
References: bsc#1218052
Patch-mainline: 6.1.75
Git-commit: 93d6fda7f926451a0fa1121b9558d75ca47e861e

[ Upstream commit 93d6fda7f926451a0fa1121b9558d75ca47e861e ]

Both MicroLZMA and DEFLATE algorithms can use short-lived pages on
demand for the overlapped inplace I/O decompression.

However, those short-lived pages are actually added to
`be->compressed_pages`.  Thus, it should be checked instead of
`pcl->compressed_bvecs`.

The LZ4 algorithm doesn't work like this, so it won't be impacted.
