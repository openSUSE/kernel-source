Subject: [PATCH] wifi: rtlwifi: pci: wait for firmware loading before
 releasing memory
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.13
Git-commit: b59b86c5d08be7d761c04affcbcec8184738c200

[ Upstream commit b59b86c5d08be7d761c04affcbcec8184738c200 ]

At probe error path, the firmware loading work may have already been
queued. In such a case, it will try to access memory allocated by the probe
function, which is about to be released. In such paths, wait for the
firmware worker to finish before releasing memory.
