Subject: [PATCH] fs/iomap.c: get/put the page in iomap_page_create/release()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.11
Git-commit: 61c6de667263184125d5ca75e894fcad632b0dd3

commit 61c6de667263184125d5ca75e894fcad632b0dd3 upstream.

migrate_page_move_mapping() expects pages with private data set to have
a page_count elevated by 1.  This is what used to happen for xfs through
the buffer_heads code before the switch to iomap in commit 82cb14175e7d
("xfs: add support for sub-pagesize writeback without buffer_heads").
Not having the count elevated causes move_pages() to fail on memory
mapped files coming from xfs.

Make iomap compatible with the migrate_page_move_mapping() assumption by
elevating the page count as part of iomap_page_create() and lowering it
in iomap_page_release().

It causes the move_pages() syscall to misbehave on memory mapped files
from xfs.  It does not not move any pages, which I suppose is "just" a
perf issue, but it also ends up returning a positive number which is out
of spec for the syscall.  Talking to Michal Hocko, it sounds like
returning positive numbers might be a necessary update to move_pages()
anyway though
(https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20181116114955.GJ14706@dhcp22.suse.cz).

I only hit this in tests that verify that move_pages() actually moved
the pages.  The test also got confused by the positive return from
move_pages() (it got treated as a success as positive numbers were not
expected and not handled) making it a bit harder to track down what's
going on.
