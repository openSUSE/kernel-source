commit 3db66620ea90b0fd4134b31eabfec16d7b07d7e3 upstream.

Remove the acpi_backlight=video quirk for Lenovo ThinkPad W530.

This was intended to help users of the (unsupported) Nvidia binary driver,
but this has been reported to cause backlight control issues for users
who have the gfx configured in hybrid (dual-GPU) mode, so drop this.

The Nvidia binary driver should call acpi_video_register_backlight()
when necessary and this has been reported to Nvidia.

Until this is fixed Nvidia binary driver users can work around this by
passing "acpi_backlight=video" on the kernel commandline (with the latest
6.1.y or newer stable series, kernels < 6.1.y don't need this).
