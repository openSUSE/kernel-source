Subject: [PATCH] futex: Provide distinct return value when owner is exiting
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.1
Git-commit: ac31c7ff8624409ba3c4901df9237a616c187a5d

commit ac31c7ff8624409ba3c4901df9237a616c187a5d upstream.

attach_to_pi_owner() returns -EAGAIN for various cases:

 - Owner task is exiting
 - Futex value has changed

The caller drops the held locks (hash bucket, mmap_sem) and retries the
operation. In case of the owner task exiting this can result in a live
lock.

As a preparatory step for seperating those cases, provide a distinct return
value (EBUSY) for the owner exiting case.

No functional change.
