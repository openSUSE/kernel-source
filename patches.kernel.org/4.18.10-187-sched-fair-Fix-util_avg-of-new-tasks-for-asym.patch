Subject: [PATCH] sched/fair: Fix util_avg of new tasks for asymmetric systems
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.10
Git-commit: 8fe5c5a937d0f4e84221631833a2718afde52285

[ Upstream commit 8fe5c5a937d0f4e84221631833a2718afde52285 ]

When a new task wakes-up for the first time, its initial utilization
is set to half of the spare capacity of its CPU. The current
implementation of post_init_entity_util_avg() uses SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE
directly as a capacity reference. As a result, on a big.LITTLE system, a
new task waking up on an idle little CPU will be given ~512 of util_avg,
even if the CPU's capacity is significantly less than that.

Fix this by computing the spare capacity with arch_scale_cpu_capacity().
