Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: imx93: Fix anatop node size
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.47
Git-commit: 78e869dd8b2ba19765ac9b05cdea3e432d1dc188

[ Upstream commit 78e869dd8b2ba19765ac9b05cdea3e432d1dc188 ]

Although the memory map of i.MX93 reference manual rev. 2 claims that
analog top has start address of 0x44480000 and end address of 0x4448ffff,
this overlaps with TMU memory area starting at 0x44482000, as stated in
section 73.6.1.
As PLL configuration registers start at addresses up to 0x44481400, as used
by clk-imx93, reduce the anatop size to 0x2000, so exclude the TMU area
but keep all PLL registers inside.
