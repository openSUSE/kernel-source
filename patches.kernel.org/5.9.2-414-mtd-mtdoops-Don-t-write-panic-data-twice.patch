Subject: [PATCH] mtd: mtdoops: Don't write panic data twice
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.2
Git-commit: c1cf1d57d1492235309111ea6a900940213a9166

[ Upstream commit c1cf1d57d1492235309111ea6a900940213a9166 ]

If calling mtdoops_write, don't also schedule work to be done later.

Although this appears to not be causing an issue, possibly because the
scheduled work will never get done, it is confusing.
