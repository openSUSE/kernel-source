Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: scan: Update honor list for RPMI System MSI
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.8
Git-commit: 4215d1cf59e4b272755f4277a05cd5967935a704

[ Upstream commit 4215d1cf59e4b272755f4277a05cd5967935a704 ]

The RPMI System MSI interrupt controller (just like PLIC and APLIC)
needs to probed prior to devices like GED which use interrupts provided
by it. Also, it has dependency on the SBI MPXY mailbox device.

Add HIDs of RPMI System MSI and SBI MPXY mailbox devices to the honor
list so that those dependencies are handled.
