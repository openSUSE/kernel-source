Subject: [PATCH] igbvf: Use smp_rmb rather than read_barrier_depends
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.3
Git-commit: 1e1f9ca546556e508d021545861f6b5fc75a95fe

commit 1e1f9ca546556e508d021545861f6b5fc75a95fe upstream.

The original issue being fixed in this patch was seen with the ixgbe
driver, but the same issue exists with igbvf as well, as the code is
very similar. read_barrier_depends is not sufficient to ensure
loads following it are not speculatively loaded out of order
by the CPU, which can result in stale data being loaded, causing
potential system crashes.
