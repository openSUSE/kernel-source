Subject: [PATCH] clk: ralink: avoid to set 'CLK_IS_CRITICAL' flag for gates
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.6
Git-commit: c16edf5ff8ece9c4135175da4103cee1bec360be

[ Upstream commit c16edf5ff8ece9c4135175da4103cee1bec360be ]

'clk_init_data' for gates is setting up 'CLK_IS_CRITICAL'
flag for all of them. This was being doing because some
drivers of this SoC might not be ready to use the clock
and we don't wanted the kernel to disable them since default
behaviour without clock driver was to set all gate bits to
enabled state. After a bit more testing and checking driver
code it is safe to remove this flag and just let the kernel
to disable those gates that are not in use. No regressions
seems to appear.
