Subject: [PATCH] binder: remove "invalid inc weak" check
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.56
Git-commit: d90eeb8ecd227c204ab6c34a17b372bd950b7aa2

commit d90eeb8ecd227c204ab6c34a17b372bd950b7aa2 upstream.

There are no scenarios where a weak increment is invalid on binder_node.
The only possible case where it could be invalid is if the kernel
delivers BR_DECREFS to the process that owns the node, and then
increments the weak refcount again, effectively "reviving" a dead node.

However, that is not possible: when the BR_DECREFS command is delivered,
the kernel removes and frees the binder_node. The fact that you were
able to call binder_inc_node_nilocked() implies that the node is not yet
destroyed, which implies that BR_DECREFS has not been delivered to
userspace, so incrementing the weak refcount is valid.

Note that it's currently possible to trigger this condition if the owner
calls BINDER_THREAD_EXIT while node->has_weak_ref is true. This causes
BC_INCREFS on binder_ref instances to fail when they should not.
