Subject: [PATCH] locking/rwsem: Prevent decrement of reader count before
 increment
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.4
Git-commit: a9e9bcb45b1525ba7aea26ed9441e8632aeeda58

[ Upstream commit a9e9bcb45b1525ba7aea26ed9441e8632aeeda58 ]

During my rwsem testing, it was found that after a down_read(), the
reader count may occasionally become 0 or even negative. Consequently,
a writer may steal the lock at that time and execute with the reader
in parallel thus breaking the mutual exclusion guarantee of the write
lock. In other words, both readers and writer can become rwsem owners
simultaneously.

The current reader wakeup code does it in one pass to clear waiter->task
and put them into wake_q before fully incrementing the reader count.
Once waiter->task is cleared, the corresponding reader may see it,
finish the critical section and do unlock to decrement the count before
the count is incremented. This is not a problem if there is only one
reader to wake up as the count has been pre-incremented by 1.  It is
a problem if there are more than one readers to be woken up and writer
can steal the lock.

The wakeup was actually done in 2 passes before the following v4.9 commit:

  70800c3c0cc5 ("locking/rwsem: Scan the wait_list for readers only once")

To fix this problem, the wakeup is now done in two passes
again. In the first pass, we collect the readers and count them.
The reader count is then fully incremented. In the second pass, the
waiter->task is then cleared and they are put into wake_q to be woken
up later.
