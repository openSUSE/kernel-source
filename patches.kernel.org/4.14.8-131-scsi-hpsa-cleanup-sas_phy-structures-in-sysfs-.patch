Subject: [PATCH] scsi: hpsa: cleanup sas_phy structures in sysfs when
 unloading
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.8

[ Upstream commit 55ca38b4255bb336c2d35990bdb2b368e19b435a ]

I am resubmitting this patch on behalf of Martin Wilck with his
permission.

The original patch can be found here:
https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-scsi/msg102083.html

This patch did not help until Hannes's
commit 9441284fbc39 ("scsi-fixup-kernel-warning-during-rmmod")
was applied to the kernel.

--------------------------------------
Original patch description from Martin:
--------------------------------------

When the hpsa module is unloaded using rmmod, dangling
symlinks remain under /sys/class/sas_phy. Fix this by
calling sas_phy_delete() rather than sas_phy_free (which,
according to comments, should not be called for PHYs that
have been set up successfully, anyway).
