Subject: [PATCH] mm/hugetlb: defer freeing of huge pages if in non-task
 context
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.9

[ Upstream commit c77c0a8ac4c522638a8242fcb9de9496e3cdbb2d ]

The following lockdep splat was observed when a certain hugetlbfs test
was run:

Both the hugetbl_lock and the subpool lock can be acquired in
free_huge_page().  One way to solve the problem is to make both locks
irq-safe.  However, Mike Kravetz had learned that the hugetlb_lock is
held for a linear scan of ALL hugetlb pages during a cgroup reparentling
operation.  So it is just too long to have irq disabled unless we can
break hugetbl_lock down into finer-grained locks with shorter lock hold
times.

Another alternative is to defer the freeing to a workqueue job.  This
patch implements the deferred freeing by adding a free_hpage_workfn()
work function to do the actual freeing.  The free_huge_page() call in a
non-task context saves the page to be freed in the hpage_freelist linked
list in a lockless manner using the llist APIs.

The generic workqueue is used to process the work, but a dedicated
workqueue can be used instead if it is desirable to have the huge page
freed ASAP.

Thanks to Kirill Tkhai <ktkhai@virtuozzo.com> for suggesting the use of
llist APIs which simplfy the code.
