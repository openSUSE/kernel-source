Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: Re-apply "Perform link quality check,
 unconditionally during long pulse"
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.8
Git-commit: 399334708b4f07b107094e5db4a390f0f25d2d4f
Git-commit: 3cf71bc9904d7ee4a25a822c5dcb54c7804ea388

commit 399334708b4f07b107094e5db4a390f0f25d2d4f upstream.

This re-applies the workaround for "some DP sinks, [which] are a
little nuts" from commit 1a36147bb939 ("drm/i915: Perform link
quality check unconditionally during long pulse").
It makes the secondary AOC E2460P monitor connected via DP to an
acer Veriton N4640G usable again.

This hunk was dropped in commit c85d200e8321 ("drm/i915: Move SST
DP link retraining into the ->post_hotplug() hook")

Fixes: c85d200e8321 ("drm/i915: Move SST DP link retraining into the ->post_hotplug() hook")
