Subject: [PATCH] x86/entry/64: Add missing irqflags tracing to
 native_load_gs_index()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.3
Git-commit: ca37e57bbe0cf1455ea3e84eb89ed04a132d59e1

commit ca37e57bbe0cf1455ea3e84eb89ed04a132d59e1 upstream.

Running this code with IRQs enabled (where dummy_lock is a spinlock):

static void check_load_gs_index(void)
{
	/* This will fail. */
	load_gs_index(0xffff);

	spin_lock(&dummy_lock);
	spin_unlock(&dummy_lock);
}

Will generate a lockdep warning.  The issue is that the actual write
to %gs would cause an exception with IRQs disabled, and the exception
handler would, as an inadvertent side effect, update irqflag tracing
to reflect the IRQs-off status.  native_load_gs_index() would then
turn IRQs back on and return with irqflag tracing still thinking that
IRQs were off.  The dummy lock-and-unlock causes lockdep to notice the
error and warn.

Fix it by adding the missing tracing.

Apparently nothing did this in a context where it mattered.  I haven't
tried to find a code path that would actually exhibit the warning if
appropriately nasty user code were running.

I suspect that the security impact of this bug is very, very low --
production systems don't run with lockdep enabled, and the warning is
mostly harmless anyway.

Found during a quick audit of the entry code to try to track down an
unrelated bug that Ingo found in some still-in-development code.
