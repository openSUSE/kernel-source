Subject: [PATCH] arm64: hibernate: Clean the __hyp_text to PoC after resume
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.7
Git-commit: f7daa9c8fd191724b9ab9580a7be55cd1a67d799

commit f7daa9c8fd191724b9ab9580a7be55cd1a67d799 upstream.

During resume hibernate restores all physical memory. Any memory
that is accessed with the MMU disabled needs to be cleaned to the
PoC.

KVMs __hyp_text was previously ommitted as it runs with the MMU
enabled, but now that the hyp-stub is located in this section,
we must clean __hyp_text too.

This ensures secondary CPUs that come online after hibernate
has finished resuming, and load KVM via the freshly written
hyp-stub see the correct instructions.
