Subject: [PATCH] Revert "mm: slowly shrink slabs with a relatively small
 number of objects"
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.11
Git-commit: a9a238e83fbb0df31c3b9b67003f8f9d1d1b6c96

commit a9a238e83fbb0df31c3b9b67003f8f9d1d1b6c96 upstream.

This reverts commit 172b06c32b9497 ("mm: slowly shrink slabs with a
relatively small number of objects").

This change changes the agressiveness of shrinker reclaim, causing small
cache and low priority reclaim to greatly increase scanning pressure on
small caches.  As a result, light memory pressure has a disproportionate
affect on small caches, and causes large caches to be reclaimed much
faster than previously.

As a result, it greatly perturbs the delicate balance of the VFS caches
(dentry/inode vs file page cache) such that the inode/dentry caches are
reclaimed much, much faster than the page cache and this drives us into
several other caching imbalance related problems.

As such, this is a bad change and needs to be reverted.

[ Needs some massaging to retain the later seekless shrinker
  modifications.]
