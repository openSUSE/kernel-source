Subject: [PATCH] irqchip/gic-v3: Workaround inconsistent PMR setting on NMI
 entry
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.13
Git-commit: 382e6e177bc1c02473e56591fe5083ae1e4904f6

[ Upstream commit 382e6e177bc1c02473e56591fe5083ae1e4904f6 ]

The arm64 entry code suffers from an annoying issue on taking
a NMI, as it sets PMR to a value that actually allows IRQs
to be acknowledged. This is done for consistency with other parts
of the code, and is in the process of being fixed. This shouldn't
be a problem, as we are not enabling interrupts whilst in NMI
context.

However, in the infortunate scenario that we took a spurious NMI
(retired before the read of IAR) *and* that there is an IRQ pending
at the same time, we'll ack the IRQ in NMI context. Too bad.

In order to avoid deadlocks while running something like perf,
teach the GICv3 driver about this situation: if we were in
a context where no interrupt should have fired, transiently
set PMR to a value that only allows NMIs before acking the pending
interrupt, and restore the original value after that.

This papers over the core issue for the time being, and makes
NMIs great again. Sort of.
