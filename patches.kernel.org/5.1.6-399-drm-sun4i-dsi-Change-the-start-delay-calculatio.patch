Subject: [PATCH] drm/sun4i: dsi: Change the start delay calculation
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.6
Git-commit: da676c6aa6413d59ab0a80c97bbc273025e640b2

[ Upstream commit da676c6aa6413d59ab0a80c97bbc273025e640b2 ]

The current calculation for the video start delay in the current DSI driver
is that it is the total vertical size, minus the front porch and sync length,
plus 1. This equals to the active vertical size plus the back porch plus 1.

That 1 is coming in the Allwinner BSP from an variable that is set to 1.
However, if we look at the Allwinner BSP more closely, and especially in
the "legacy" code for the display (in drivers/video/sunxi/legacy/), we can
see that this variable is actually computed from the porches and the sync
minus 10, clamped between 8 and 100.

This fixes the start delay symptom we've seen on some panels (vblank
timeouts with vertical white stripes at the bottom of the panel).
