Subject: [PATCH] staging: gpib: Fix device reference leak in fmh_gpib driver
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.6
Git-commit: b1aabb8ef09b4cf0cc0c92ca9dfd19482f3192c1

commit b1aabb8ef09b4cf0cc0c92ca9dfd19482f3192c1 upstream.

The fmh_gpib driver contains a device reference count leak in
fmh_gpib_attach_impl() where driver_find_device() increases the
reference count of the device by get_device() when matching but this
reference is not properly decreased. Add put_device() in
fmh_gpib_detach(), which ensures that the reference count of the
device is correctly managed.

Found by code review.
