Subject: [PATCH] l2tp: Allow duplicate session creation with UDP
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.3
Git-commit: 0d0d9a388a858e271bb70e71e99e7fe2a6fd6f64

[ Upstream commit 0d0d9a388a858e271bb70e71e99e7fe2a6fd6f64 ]

In the past it was possible to create multiple L2TPv3 sessions with the
same session id as long as the sessions belonged to different tunnels.
The resulting sessions had issues when used with IP encapsulated tunnels,
but worked fine with UDP encapsulated ones. Some applications began to
rely on this behaviour to avoid having to negotiate unique session ids.

Some time ago a change was made to require session ids to be unique across
all tunnels, breaking the applications making use of this "feature".

This change relaxes the duplicate session id check to allow duplicates
if both of the colliding sessions belong to UDP encapsulated tunnels.
