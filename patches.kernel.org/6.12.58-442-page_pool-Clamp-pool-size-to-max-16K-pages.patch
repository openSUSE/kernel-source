Subject: [PATCH] page_pool: Clamp pool size to max 16K pages
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.58
Git-commit: a1b501a8c6a87c9265fd03bd004035199e2e8128

[ Upstream commit a1b501a8c6a87c9265fd03bd004035199e2e8128 ]

page_pool_init() returns E2BIG when the page_pool size goes above 32K
pages. As some drivers are configuring the page_pool size according to
the MTU and ring size, there are cases where this limit is exceeded and
the queue creation fails.

The page_pool size doesn't have to cover a full queue, especially for
larger ring size. So clamp the size instead of returning an error. Do
this in the core to avoid having each driver do the clamping.

The current limit was deemed to high [1] so it was reduced to 16K to avoid
page waste.
