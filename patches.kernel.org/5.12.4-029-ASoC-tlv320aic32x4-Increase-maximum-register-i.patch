Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: tlv320aic32x4: Increase maximum register in regmap
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.4
Git-commit: 29654ed8384e9dbaf4cfba689dbcb664a6ab4bb7

commit 29654ed8384e9dbaf4cfba689dbcb664a6ab4bb7 upstream.

AIC32X4_REFPOWERUP was added as a register, but the maximum register value
in the regmap and regmap range was not correspondingly increased.  This
caused an error when this register was attempted to be written.
