Subject: [PATCH] MIPS: Fix an FCSR access API regression with NT_PRFPREG and
 MSA
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.14
Git-commit: be07a6a1188372b6d19a3307ec33211fc9c9439d

commit be07a6a1188372b6d19a3307ec33211fc9c9439d upstream.

Fix a commit 72b22bbad1e7 ("MIPS: Don't assume 64-bit FP registers for
FP regset") public API regression, then activated by commit 1db1af84d6df
("MIPS: Basic MSA context switching support"), that caused the FCSR
register not to be read or written for CONFIG_CPU_HAS_MSA kernel
configurations (regardless of actual presence or absence of the MSA
feature in a given processor) with ptrace(2) PTRACE_GETREGSET and
PTRACE_SETREGSET requests nor recorded in core dumps.

This is because with !CONFIG_CPU_HAS_MSA configurations the whole of
`elf_fpregset_t' array is bulk-copied as it is, which includes the FCSR
in one half of the last, 33rd slot, whereas with CONFIG_CPU_HAS_MSA
configurations array elements are copied individually, and then only the
leading 32 FGR slots while the remaining slot is ignored.

Correct the code then such that only FGR slots are copied in the
respective !MSA and MSA helpers an then the FCSR slot is handled
separately in common code.  Use `ptrace_setfcr31' to update the FCSR
too, so that the read-only mask is respected.

Retrieving a correct value of FCSR is important in debugging not only
for the human to be able to get the right interpretation of the
situation, but for correct operation of GDB as well.  This is because
the condition code bits in FSCR are used by GDB to determine the
location to place a breakpoint at when single-stepping through an FPU
branch instruction.  If such a breakpoint is placed incorrectly (i.e.
with the condition reversed), then it will be missed, likely causing the
debuggee to run away from the control of GDB and consequently breaking
the process of investigation.

Fortunately GDB continues using the older PTRACE_GETFPREGS ptrace(2)
request which is unaffected, so the regression only really hits with
post-mortem debug sessions using a core dump file, in which case
execution, and consequently single-stepping through branches is not
possible.  Of course core files created by buggy kernels out there will
have the value of FCSR recorded clobbered, but such core files cannot be
corrected and the person using them simply will have to be aware that
the value of FCSR retrieved is not reliable.

Which also means we can likely get away without defining a replacement
API which would ensure a correct value of FSCR to be retrieved, or none
at all.

This is based on previous work by Alex Smith, extensively rewritten.
