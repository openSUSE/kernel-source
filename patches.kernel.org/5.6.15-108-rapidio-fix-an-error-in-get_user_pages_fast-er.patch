Subject: [PATCH] rapidio: fix an error in get_user_pages_fast() error handling
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.15
Git-commit: ffca476a0a8d26de767cc41d62b8ca7f540ecfdd

commit ffca476a0a8d26de767cc41d62b8ca7f540ecfdd upstream.

In the case of get_user_pages_fast() returning fewer pages than
requested, rio_dma_transfer() does not quite do the right thing.  It
attempts to release all the pages that were requested, rather than just
the pages that were pinned.

Fix the error handling so that only the pages that were successfully
pinned are released.
