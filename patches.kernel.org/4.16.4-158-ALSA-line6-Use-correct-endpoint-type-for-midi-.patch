Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: line6: Use correct endpoint type for midi output

commit 7ecb46e9ee9af18e304eb9e7d6804c59a408e846 upstream.

Sending MIDI messages to a PODxt through the USB connection shows
"usb_submit_urb failed" in dmesg and the message is not received by
the POD.

The error is caused because in the funcion send_midi_async() in midi.c
there is a call to usb_sndbulkpipe() for endpoint 3 OUT, but the PODxt
USB descriptor shows that this endpoint it's an interrupt endpoint.

Patch tested with PODxt only.

[ The bug has been present from the very beginning in the staging
  driver time, but Fixes below points to the commit moving to sound/
  directory so that the fix can be cleanly applied -- tiwai ]
