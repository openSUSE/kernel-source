Subject: [PATCH] Input: i8042 - add Fujitsu Lifebook U728 to i8042 quirk table
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.7
Git-commit: 4255447ad34c5c3785fcdcf76cfa0271d6e5ed39

[ Upstream commit 4255447ad34c5c3785fcdcf76cfa0271d6e5ed39 ]

Another Fujitsu-related patch.

In the initial boot stage the integrated keyboard of Fujitsu Lifebook U728
refuses to work and it's not possible to type for example a dm-crypt
passphrase without the help of an external keyboard.

i8042.nomux kernel parameter resolves this issue but using that a PS/2
mouse is detected. This input device is unused even when the i2c-hid-acpi
kernel module is blacklisted making the integrated ELAN touchpad
(04F3:3092) not working at all.

So this notebook uses a hid-over-i2c touchpad which is managed by the
i2c_designware input driver. Since you can't find a PS/2 mouse port on this
computer and you can't connect a PS/2 mouse to it even with an official
port replicator I think it's safe to not use the PS/2 mouse port at all.
