Subject: [PATCH] pwm: meson: Fix axg ao mux parents
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.28
Git-commit: eb411c0cf59ae6344b34bc6f0d298a22b300627e

commit eb411c0cf59ae6344b34bc6f0d298a22b300627e upstream.

This fix is basically the same as 9bce02ef0dfa ("pwm: meson: Fix the
G12A AO clock parents order"). Vendor driver referenced there has
xtal as first parent also for axg ao. In addition fix the name
of the aoclk81 clock. Apparently name aoclk81 as used by the vendor
driver was changed when mainlining the axg clock driver.

Fixes: bccaa3f917c9 ("pwm: meson: Add clock source configuration for Meson-AXG")
