Subject: [PATCH] pstore: ram_core: fix possible overflow in
 persistent_ram_init_ecc()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.2
Git-commit: 86222a8fc16ec517de8da2604d904c9df3a08e5d

[ Upstream commit 86222a8fc16ec517de8da2604d904c9df3a08e5d ]

In persistent_ram_init_ecc(), on 64-bit arches DIV_ROUND_UP() will return
64-bit value since persistent_ram_zone::buffer_size has type size_t which
is derived from the 64-bit *unsigned long*, while the ecc_blocks variable
this value gets assigned to has (always 32-bit) *int* type.  Even if that
value fits into *int* type, an overflow is still possible when calculating
the size_t typed ecc_total variable further below since there's no cast to
any 64-bit type before multiplication.  Declaring the ecc_blocks variable
as *size_t* should fix this mess...

analysis tool.
