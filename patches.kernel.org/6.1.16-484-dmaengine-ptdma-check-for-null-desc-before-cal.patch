Subject: [PATCH] dmaengine: ptdma: check for null desc before calling
 pt_cmd_callback
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: 928469986171a6f763b34b039427f5667ba3fd50

[ Upstream commit 928469986171a6f763b34b039427f5667ba3fd50 ]

Resolves a panic that can occur on AMD systems, typically during host
shutdown, after the PTDMA driver had been exercised. The issue was
the pt_issue_pending() function is mistakenly assuming that there will
be at least one descriptor in the Submitted queue when the function
is called. However, it is possible that both the Submitted and Issued
queues could be empty, which could result in pt_cmd_callback() being
mistakenly called with a NULL pointer.
Ref: Bugzilla Bug 216856.
