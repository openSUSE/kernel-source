Subject: [PATCH] media: dvb_demux: fix a bug for the continuity counter
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.33
Git-commit: 7efb10d8dc70ea3000cc70dca53407c52488acd1

[ Upstream commit 7efb10d8dc70ea3000cc70dca53407c52488acd1 ]

In dvb_demux.c, some logics exist which compare the expected
continuity counter and the real continuity counter. If they
are not matched each other, both of the expected continuity
counter and the real continuity counter should be printed.
But there exists a bug that the expected continuity counter
is not correctly printed. The expected continuity counter is
replaced with the real countinuity counter + 1 so that
the epected continuity counter is not correclty printed.
This is wrong. This bug is fixed.
