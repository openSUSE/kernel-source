Subject: [PATCH] usb: quirks: add control message delay for 1b1c:1b20
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.11
Git-commit: cb88a0588717ba6c756cb5972d75766b273a6817

commit cb88a0588717ba6c756cb5972d75766b273a6817 upstream.

Corsair Strafe RGB keyboard does not respond to usb control messages
sometimes and hence generates timeouts.

Commit de3af5bf259d ("usb: quirks: add delay init quirk for Corsair
Strafe RGB keyboard") tried to fix those timeouts by adding
USB_QUIRK_DELAY_INIT.

Unfortunately, even with this quirk timeouts of usb_control_msg()
can still be seen, but with a lower frequency (approx. 1 out of 15):

[   29.103520] usb 1-8: string descriptor 0 read error: -110
[   34.363097] usb 1-8: can't set config #1, error -110

Adding further delays to different locations where usb control
messages are issued just moves the timeouts to other locations,
e.g.:

[   35.400533] usbhid 1-8:1.0: can't add hid device: -110
[   35.401014] usbhid: probe of 1-8:1.0 failed with error -110

The only way to reliably avoid those issues is having a pause after
each usb control message. In approx. 200 boot cycles no more timeouts
were seen.

Addionaly, keep USB_QUIRK_DELAY_INIT as it turned out to be necessary
to have the delay in hub_port_connect() after hub_port_init().

The overall boot time seems not to be influenced by these additional
delays, even on fast machines and lightweight distributions.
