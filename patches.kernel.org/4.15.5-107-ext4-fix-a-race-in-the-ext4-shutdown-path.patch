Subject: [PATCH] ext4: fix a race in the ext4 shutdown path
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.5
Git-commit: abbc3f9395c76d554a9ed27d4b1ebfb5d9b0e4ca

commit abbc3f9395c76d554a9ed27d4b1ebfb5d9b0e4ca upstream.

This patch fixes a race between the shutdown path and bio completion
handling. In the ext4 direct io path with async io, after submitting a
bio to the block layer, if journal starting fails,
ext4_direct_IO_write() would bail out pretending that the IO
failed. The caller would have had no way of knowing whether or not the
IO was successfully submitted. So instead, we return -EIOCBQUEUED in
this case. Now, the caller knows that the IO was submitted.  The bio
completion handler takes care of the error.

Tested: Ran the shutdown xfstest test 461 in loop for over 2 hours across
4 machines resulting in over 400 runs. Verified that the race didn't
occur. Usually the race was seen in about 20-30 iterations.
