Subject: [PATCH] mm/z3fold.c: fix z3fold_destroy_pool() race condition
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.10
Git-commit: b997052bc3ac444a0bceab1093aff7ae71ed419e

commit b997052bc3ac444a0bceab1093aff7ae71ed419e upstream.

The constraint from the zpool use of z3fold_destroy_pool() is there are
no outstanding handles to memory (so no active allocations), but it is
possible for there to be outstanding work on either of the two wqs in
the pool.

Calling z3fold_deregister_migration() before the workqueues are drained
means that there can be allocated pages referencing a freed inode,
causing any thread in compaction to be able to trip over the bad pointer
in PageMovable().
