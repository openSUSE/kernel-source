Subject: [PATCH] SUNRPC: Address Kerberos performance/behavior regression
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.6
Git-commit: deaa5c96c2f7e8b934088a1e70a0fe8797bd1149

[ Upstream commit deaa5c96c2f7e8b934088a1e70a0fe8797bd1149 ]

When using Kerberos with v4.20, I've observed frequent connection
loss on heavy workloads. I traced it down to the client underrunning
the GSS sequence number window -- NFS servers are required to drop
the RPC with the low sequence number, and also drop the connection
to signal that an RPC was dropped.

Bisected to commit 918f3c1fe83c ("SUNRPC: Improve latency for
interactive tasks").

I've got a one-line workaround for this issue, which is easy to
backport to v4.20 while a more permanent solution is being derived.
Essentially, tk_owner-based sorting is disabled for RPCs that carry
a GSS sequence number.
