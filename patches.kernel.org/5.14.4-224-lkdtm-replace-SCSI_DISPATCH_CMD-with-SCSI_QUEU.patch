Subject: [PATCH] lkdtm: replace SCSI_DISPATCH_CMD with SCSI_QUEUE_RQ
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.4
Git-commit: d1f278da6b11585f05b2755adfc8851cbf14a1ec

[ Upstream commit d1f278da6b11585f05b2755adfc8851cbf14a1ec ]

When scsi_dispatch_cmd was moved to scsi_lib.c and made static, some
compilers (i.e., at least gcc 8.4.0) decided to compile this
inline. This is a problem for lkdtm.ko, which inserted a kprobe
on this function for the SCSI_DISPATCH_CMD crashpoint.

Move this crashpoint one function up the call chain to
scsi_queue_rq. Though this is also a static function, it should never be
inlined because it is assigned as a structure entry. Therefore,
kprobe_register should always be able to find it.
