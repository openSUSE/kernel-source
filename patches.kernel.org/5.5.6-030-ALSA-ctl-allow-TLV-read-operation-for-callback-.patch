Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: ctl: allow TLV read operation for callback type of
 element in locked case
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.6
Git-commit: d61fe22c2ae42d9fd76c34ef4224064cca4b04b0

[ Upstream commit d61fe22c2ae42d9fd76c34ef4224064cca4b04b0 ]

A design of ALSA control core allows applications to execute three
operations for TLV feature; read, write and command. Furthermore, it
allows driver developers to process the operations by two ways; allocated
array or callback function. In the former, read operation is just allowed,
thus developers uses the latter when device driver supports variety of
models or the target model is expected to dynamically change information
stored in TLV container.

The core also allows applications to lock any element so that the other
applications can't perform write operation to the element for element
value and TLV information. When the element is locked, write and command
operation for TLV information are prohibited as well as element value.
Any read operation should be allowed in the case.

At present, when an element has callback function for TLV information,
TLV read operation returns EPERM if the element is locked. On the
other hand, the read operation is success when an element has allocated
array for TLV information. In both cases, read operation is success for
element value expectedly.

This commit fixes the bug. This change can be backported to v4.14
kernel or later.
