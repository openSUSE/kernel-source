Subject: [PATCH] scsi: ses: Don't attach if enclosure has no components
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: 3fe97ff3d94934649abb0652028dd7296170c8d0

commit 3fe97ff3d94934649abb0652028dd7296170c8d0 upstream.

An enclosure with no components can't usefully be operated by the driver
(since effectively it has nothing to manage), so report the problem and
don't attach. Not attaching also fixes an oops which could occur if the
driver tries to manage a zero component enclosure.

[mkp: Switched to KERN_WARNING since this scenario is common]
