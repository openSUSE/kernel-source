Subject: [PATCH] usb: dwc2: disable platform lowlevel hw resources during
 shutdown
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.63
Git-commit: 7481a97c5f49f10c7490bb990d0e863f23b9bb71

[ Upstream commit 7481a97c5f49f10c7490bb990d0e863f23b9bb71 ]

On some SoC platforms, in shutdown stage, most components' power is cut
off, but there's still power supply to the so called always-on
domain, so if the dwc2's regulator is from the always-on domain, we
need to explicitly disable it to save power.

Disable platform lowlevel hw resources such as phy, clock and
regulators etc. in device shutdown hook to reduce non-necessary power
consumption when the platform enters shutdown stage.
