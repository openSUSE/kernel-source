Subject: [PATCH] hv_utils: Set the maximum packet size for VSS driver to the
 length of the receive buffer
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.4
Git-commit: 9d68cd9120e4e3af38f843e165631c323b86b4e4

[ Upstream commit 9d68cd9120e4e3af38f843e165631c323b86b4e4 ]

Commit adae1e931acd ("Drivers: hv: vmbus: Copy packets sent by Hyper-V out
of the ring buffer") introduced a notion of maximum packet size and for
KVM and FCOPY drivers set it to the length of the receive buffer. VSS
driver wasn't updated, this means that the maximum packet size is now
VMBUS_DEFAULT_MAX_PKT_SIZE (4k). Apparently, this is not enough. I'm
observing a packet of 6304 bytes which is being truncated to 4096. When
VSS driver tries to read next packet from ring buffer it starts from the
wrong offset and receives garbage.

Set the maximum packet size to 'HV_HYP_PAGE_SIZE * 2' in VSS driver. This
matches the length of the receive buffer and is in line with other utils
drivers.
