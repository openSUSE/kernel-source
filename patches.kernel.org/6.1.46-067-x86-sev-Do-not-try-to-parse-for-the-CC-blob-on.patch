Subject: [PATCH] x86/sev: Do not try to parse for the CC blob on non-AMD
 hardware
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.46
Git-commit: bee6cf1a80b54548a039e224c651bb15b644a480

commit bee6cf1a80b54548a039e224c651bb15b644a480 upstream.

Tao Liu reported a boot hang on an Intel Atom machine due to an unmapped
EFI config table. The reason being that the CC blob which contains the
CPUID page for AMD SNP guests is parsed for before even checking
whether the machine runs on AMD hardware.

Usually that's not a problem on !AMD hw - it simply won't find the CC
blob's GUID and return. However, if any parts of the config table
pointers array is not mapped, the kernel will #PF very early in the
decompressor stage without any opportunity to recover.

Therefore, do a superficial CPUID check before poking for the CC blob.
This will fix the current issue on real hardware. It would also work as
a guest on a non-lying hypervisor.

For the lying hypervisor, the check is done again, *after* parsing the
CC blob as the real CPUID page will be present then.

Clear the #VC handler in case SEV-{ES,SNP} hasn't been detected, as
a precaution.
