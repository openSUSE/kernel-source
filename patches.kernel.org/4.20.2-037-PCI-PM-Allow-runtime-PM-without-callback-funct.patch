Subject: [PATCH] PCI / PM: Allow runtime PM without callback functions
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.2
Git-commit: c5eb1190074cfb14c5d9cac692f1912eecf1a5e4

commit c5eb1190074cfb14c5d9cac692f1912eecf1a5e4 upstream.

a9c8088c7988 ("i2c: i801: Don't restore config registers on runtime PM")
nullified the runtime PM suspend/resume callback pointers while keeping the
runtime PM enabled.

This caused the SMBus PCI device to stay in D0 with
/sys/devices/.../power/runtime_status showing "error" when the runtime PM
framework attempted to autosuspend the device.  This is due to PCI bus
runtime PM, which checks for driver runtime PM callbacks and returns
-ENOSYS if they are not set.

Since i2c-i801.c doesn't need to do anything device-specific for runtime
PM, Jean Delvare proposed this be fixed in the PCI core rather than adding
dummy runtime PM callback functions in the PCI drivers.

Change pci_pm_runtime_suspend()/pci_pm_runtime_resume() so they allow
changing the PCI device power state during runtime PM transitions even if
the driver supplies no runtime PM callbacks.

This fixes the runtime PM regression on i2c-i801.c.

It is not obvious why the code previously required the runtime PM
callbacks.  The test has been there since the code was introduced by
6cbf82148ff2 ("PCI PM: Run-time callbacks for PCI bus type").

On the other hand, a similar change was done to generic runtime PM
callbacks in 05aa55dddb9e ("PM / Runtime: Lenient generic runtime pm
callbacks").
