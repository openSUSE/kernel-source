Subject: [PATCH] char: applicom: fix NULL pointer dereference in ac_ioctl
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.3
Git-commit: 82d12088c297fa1cef670e1718b3d24f414c23f7

commit 82d12088c297fa1cef670e1718b3d24f414c23f7 upstream.

Discovered by Atuin - Automated Vulnerability Discovery Engine.

In ac_ioctl, the validation of IndexCard and the check for a valid
RamIO pointer are skipped when cmd is 6. However, the function
unconditionally executes readb(apbs[IndexCard].RamIO + VERS) at the
end.

If cmd is 6, IndexCard may reference a board that does not exist
(where RamIO is NULL), leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

Fix this by skipping the readb access when cmd is 6, as this
command is a global information query and does not target a specific
board context.
