Subject: [PATCH] crypto: ccp: Detect and reject "invalid" addresses destined
 for PSP
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.4
Git-commit: 74c1f1366eb7714b8b211554f6c5cee315ff3fbc

[ Upstream commit 74c1f1366eb7714b8b211554f6c5cee315ff3fbc ]

Explicitly reject using pointers that are not virt_to_phys() friendly
as the source for SEV commands that are sent to the PSP.  The PSP works
with physical addresses, and __pa()/virt_to_phys() will not return the
correct address in these cases, e.g. for a vmalloc'd pointer.  At best,
the bogus address will cause the command to fail, and at worst lead to
system instability.

While it's unlikely that callers will deliberately use a bad pointer for
SEV buffers, a caller can easily use a vmalloc'd pointer unknowingly when
running with CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y as it's not obvious that putting the
command buffers on the stack would be bad.  The command buffers are
relative  small and easily fit on the stack, and the APIs to do not
document that the incoming pointer must be a physically contiguous,
__pa() friendly pointer.
