Subject: [PATCH] selftests/ftrace: Fix synthetic event test to delete event
 correctly
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.2
Git-commit: 0d0352d8b3d6d7ca9a710b40e194cbbaeb841c88

commit 0d0352d8b3d6d7ca9a710b40e194cbbaeb841c88 upstream.

Fix the synthetic event test case to remove event correctly.
If redirecting command to synthetic_event file without append
mode, it cleans up all existing events and execute (parse) the
command. This means "delete event" always fails to find the
target event.

Since previous synthetic event has a bug which doesn't return
-ENOENT even if it fails to find the deleting event, this test
passed. But fixing that bug, this test fails because this test
itself has a bug.

This fixes that bug by trying to delete event right after
adding an event, and use append mode redirection ('>>') instead
of normal redirection ('>').
