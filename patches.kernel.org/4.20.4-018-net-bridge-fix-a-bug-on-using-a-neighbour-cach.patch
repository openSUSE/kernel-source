Subject: [PATCH] net: bridge: fix a bug on using a neighbour cache entry
 without checking its state
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.4
Git-commit: 4c84edc11b76590859b1e45dd676074c59602dc4

[ Upstream commit 4c84edc11b76590859b1e45dd676074c59602dc4 ]

When handling DNAT'ed packets on a bridge device, the neighbour cache entry
from lookup was used without checking its state. It means that a cache entry
in the NUD_STALE state will be used directly instead of entering the NUD_DELAY
state to confirm the reachability of the neighbor.

This problem becomes worse after commit 2724680bceee ("neigh: Keep neighbour
cache entries if number of them is small enough."), since all neighbour cache
entries in the NUD_STALE state will be kept in the neighbour table as long as
the number of cache entries does not exceed the value specified in gc_thresh1.

This commit validates the state of a neighbour cache entry before using
the entry.
