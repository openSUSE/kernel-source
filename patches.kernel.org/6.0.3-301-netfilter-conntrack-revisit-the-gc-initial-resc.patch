Subject: [PATCH] netfilter: conntrack: revisit the gc initial rescheduling
 bias
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.3
Git-commit: 2aa192757005f130b2dd3547dda6e462e761199f

[ Upstream commit 2aa192757005f130b2dd3547dda6e462e761199f ]

The previous commit changed the way the rescheduling delay is computed
which has a side effect: the bias is now represented as much as the
other entries in the rescheduling delay which makes the logic to kick in
only with very large sets, as the initial interval is very large
(INT_MAX).

Revisit the GC initial bias to allow more frequent GC for smaller sets
while still avoiding wakeups when a machine is mostly idle. We're moving
from a large initial value to pretending we have 100 entries expiring at
the upper bound. This way only a few entries having a small timeout
won't impact much the rescheduling delay and non-idle machines will have
enough entries to lower the delay when needed. This also improves
readability as the initial bias is now linked to what is computed
instead of being an arbitrary large value.
