Subject: [PATCH] sctp: not increase stream's incnt before sending addstrm_in
 request
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.4
Git-commit: e1e46479847e66f78f79d8c24d5169a5954b3fc2

[ Upstream commit e1e46479847e66f78f79d8c24d5169a5954b3fc2 ]

Different from processing the addstrm_out request, The receiver handles
an addstrm_in request by sending back an addstrm_out request to the
sender who will increase its stream's in and incnt later.

Now stream->incnt has been increased since it sent out the addstrm_in
request in sctp_send_add_streams(), with the wrong stream->incnt will
even cause crash when copying stream info from the old stream's in to
the new one's in sctp_process_strreset_addstrm_out().

This patch is to fix it by simply removing the stream->incnt change
from sctp_send_add_streams().
