Subject: [PATCH] bdi: Fix another oops in wb_workfn()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.9
Git-commit: 3ee7e8697d5860b173132606d80a9cd35e7113ee

commit 3ee7e8697d5860b173132606d80a9cd35e7113ee upstream.

syzbot is reporting NULL pointer dereference at wb_workfn() [1] due to
wb->bdi->dev being NULL. And Dmitry confirmed that wb->state was
WB_shutting_down after wb->bdi->dev became NULL. This indicates that
unregister_bdi() failed to call wb_shutdown() on one of wb objects.

The problem is in cgwb_bdi_unregister() which does cgwb_kill() and thus
drops bdi's reference to wb structures before going through the list of
wbs again and calling wb_shutdown() on each of them. This way the loop
iterating through all wbs can easily miss a wb if that wb has already
passed through cgwb_remove_from_bdi_list() called from wb_shutdown()
from cgwb_release_workfn() and as a result fully shutdown bdi although
wb_workfn() for this wb structure is still running. In fact there are
also other ways cgwb_bdi_unregister() can race with
cgwb_release_workfn() leading e.g. to use-after-free issues:

CPU1                            CPU2
                                cgwb_bdi_unregister()
                                  cgwb_kill(*slot);

cgwb_release()
  queue_work(cgwb_release_wq, &wb->release_work);
cgwb_release_workfn()
                                  wb = list_first_entry(&bdi->wb_list, ...)
                                  spin_unlock_irq(&cgwb_lock);
  wb_shutdown(wb);
  ...
  kfree_rcu(wb, rcu);
                                  wb_shutdown(wb); -> oops use-after-free

We solve these issues by synchronizing writeback structure shutdown from
cgwb_bdi_unregister() with cgwb_release_workfn() using a new mutex. That
way we also no longer need synchronization using WB_shutting_down as the
mutex provides it for CONFIG_CGROUP_WRITEBACK case and without
CONFIG_CGROUP_WRITEBACK wb_shutdown() can be called only once from
bdi_unregister().
