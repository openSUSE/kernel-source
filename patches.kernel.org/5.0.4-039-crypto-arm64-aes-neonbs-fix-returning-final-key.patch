Subject: [PATCH] crypto: arm64/aes-neonbs - fix returning final keystream
 block
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.4
Git-commit: 12455e320e19e9cc7ad97f4ab89c280fe297387c

commit 12455e320e19e9cc7ad97f4ab89c280fe297387c upstream.

The arm64 NEON bit-sliced implementation of AES-CTR fails the improved
skcipher tests because it sometimes produces the wrong ciphertext.  The
bug is that the final keystream block isn't returned from the assembly
code when the number of non-final blocks is zero.  This can happen if
the input data ends a few bytes after a page boundary.  In this case the
last bytes get "encrypted" by XOR'ing them with uninitialized memory.

Fix the assembly code to return the final keystream block when needed.

Fixes: 88a3f582bea9 ("crypto: arm64/aes - don't use IV buffer to return final keystream block")
