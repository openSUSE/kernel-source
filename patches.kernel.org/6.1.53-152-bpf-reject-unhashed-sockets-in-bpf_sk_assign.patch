Subject: [PATCH] bpf: reject unhashed sockets in bpf_sk_assign
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.53
Git-commit: 67312adc96b5a585970d03b62412847afe2c6b01

[ Upstream commit 67312adc96b5a585970d03b62412847afe2c6b01 ]

The semantics for bpf_sk_assign are as follows:

    sk = some_lookup_func()
    bpf_sk_assign(skb, sk)
    bpf_sk_release(sk)

That is, the sk is not consumed by bpf_sk_assign. The function
therefore needs to make sure that sk lives long enough to be
consumed from __inet_lookup_skb. The path through the stack for a
TCPv4 packet is roughly:

  netif_receive_skb_core: takes RCU read lock
    __netif_receive_skb_core:
      sch_handle_ingress:
        tcf_classify:
          bpf_sk_assign()
      deliver_ptype_list_skb:
        deliver_skb:
          ip_packet_type->func == ip_rcv:
            ip_rcv_core:
            ip_rcv_finish_core:
              dst_input:
                ip_local_deliver:
                  ip_local_deliver_finish:
                    ip_protocol_deliver_rcu:
                      tcp_v4_rcv:
                        __inet_lookup_skb:
                          skb_steal_sock

The existing helper takes advantage of the fact that everything
happens in the same RCU critical section: for sockets with
SOCK_RCU_FREE set bpf_sk_assign never takes a reference.
skb_steal_sock then checks SOCK_RCU_FREE again and does sock_put
if necessary.

This approach assumes that SOCK_RCU_FREE is never set on a sk
between bpf_sk_assign and skb_steal_sock, but this invariant is
violated by unhashed UDP sockets. A new UDP socket is created
in TCP_CLOSE state but without SOCK_RCU_FREE set. That flag is only
added in udp_lib_get_port() which happens when a socket is bound.

When bpf_sk_assign was added it wasn't possible to access unhashed
UDP sockets from BPF, so this wasn't a problem. This changed
in commit 0c48eefae712 ("sock_map: Lift socket state restriction
for datagram sockets"), but the helper wasn't adjusted accordingly.
The following sequence of events will therefore lead to a refcount
leak:

1. Add socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM) to a sockmap.
2. Pull socket out of sockmap and bpf_sk_assign it. Since
   SOCK_RCU_FREE is not set we increment the refcount.
3. bind() or connect() the socket, setting SOCK_RCU_FREE.
4. skb_steal_sock will now set refcounted = false due to
   SOCK_RCU_FREE.
5. tcp_v4_rcv() skips sock_put().

Fix the problem by rejecting unhashed sockets in bpf_sk_assign().
This matches the behaviour of __inet_lookup_skb which is ultimately
the goal of bpf_sk_assign().
