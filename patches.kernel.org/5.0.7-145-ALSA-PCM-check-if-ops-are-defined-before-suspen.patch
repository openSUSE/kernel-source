Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: PCM: check if ops are defined before suspending PCM
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.7
Git-commit: d9c0b2afe820fa3b3f8258a659daee2cc71ca3ef

[ Upstream commit d9c0b2afe820fa3b3f8258a659daee2cc71ca3ef ]

BE dai links only have internal PCM's and their substream ops may
not be set. Suspending these PCM's will result in their
 ops->trigger() being invoked and cause a kernel oops.
So skip suspending PCM's if their ops are NULL.

[ NOTE: this change is required now for following the recent PCM core
  change to get rid of snd_pcm_suspend() call.  Since DPCM BE takes
  the runtime carried from FE while keeping NULL ops, it can hit this
  bug.  See details at:
