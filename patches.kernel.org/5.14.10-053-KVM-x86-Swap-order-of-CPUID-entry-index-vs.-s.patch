Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: Swap order of CPUID entry "index" vs. "significant
 flag" checks
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.10
Git-commit: e8a747d0884e554a8c1872da6c8f680a4f893c6d

commit e8a747d0884e554a8c1872da6c8f680a4f893c6d upstream.

Check whether a CPUID entry's index is significant before checking for a
matching index to hack-a-fix an undefined behavior bug due to consuming
uninitialized data.  RESET/INIT emulation uses kvm_cpuid() to retrieve
CPUID.0x1, which does _not_ have a significant index, and fails to
initialize the dummy variable that doubles as EBX/ECX/EDX output _and_
ECX, a.k.a. index, input.

Practically speaking, it's _extremely_  unlikely any compiler will yield
code that causes problems, as the compiler would need to inline the
kvm_cpuid() call to detect the uninitialized data, and intentionally hose
the kernel, e.g. insert ud2, instead of simply ignoring the result of
the index comparison.

Although the sketchy "dummy" pattern was introduced in SVM by commit
66f7b72e1171 ("KVM: x86: Make register state after reset conform to
specification"), it wasn't actually broken until commit 7ff6c0350315
("KVM: x86: Remove stateful CPUID handling") arbitrarily swapped the
order of operations such that "index" was checked before the significant
flag.

Avoid consuming uninitialized data by reverting to checking the flag
before the index purely so that the fix can be easily backported; the
offending RESET/INIT code has been refactored, moved, and consolidated
from vendor code to common x86 since the bug was introduced.  A future
patch will directly address the bad RESET/INIT behavior.

The undefined behavior was detected by syzbot + KernelMemorySanitizer.
