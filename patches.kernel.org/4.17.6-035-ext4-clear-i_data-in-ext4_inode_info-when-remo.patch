Subject: [PATCH] ext4: clear i_data in ext4_inode_info when removing inline
 data
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.6
Git-commit: 6e8ab72a812396996035a37e5ca4b3b99b5d214b

commit 6e8ab72a812396996035a37e5ca4b3b99b5d214b upstream.

When converting from an inode from storing the data in-line to a data
block, ext4_destroy_inline_data_nolock() was only clearing the on-disk
copy of the i_blocks[] array.  It was not clearing copy of the
i_blocks[] in ext4_inode_info, in i_data[], which is the copy actually
used by ext4_map_blocks().

This didn't matter much if we are using extents, since the extents
header would be invalid and thus the extents could would re-initialize
the extents tree.  But if we are using indirect blocks, the previous
contents of the i_blocks array will be treated as block numbers, with
potentially catastrophic results to the file system integrity and/or
user data.

This gets worse if the file system is using a 1k block size and
s_first_data is zero, but even without this, the file system can get
quite badly corrupted.

This addresses CVE-2018-10881.
