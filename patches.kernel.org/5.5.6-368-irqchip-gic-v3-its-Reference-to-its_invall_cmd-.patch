Subject: [PATCH] irqchip/gic-v3-its: Reference to its_invall_cmd descriptor
 when building INVALL
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.6
Git-commit: 107945227ac5d4c37911c7841b27c64b489ce9a9

[ Upstream commit 107945227ac5d4c37911c7841b27c64b489ce9a9 ]

It looks like an obvious mistake to use its_mapc_cmd descriptor when
building the INVALL command block. It so far worked by luck because
both its_mapc_cmd.col and its_invall_cmd.col sit at the same offset of
the ITS command descriptor, but we should not rely on it.
