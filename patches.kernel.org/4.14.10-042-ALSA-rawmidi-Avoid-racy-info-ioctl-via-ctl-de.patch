Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: rawmidi: Avoid racy info ioctl via ctl device
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.10
Git-commit: c1cfd9025cc394fd137a01159d74335c5ac978ce

commit c1cfd9025cc394fd137a01159d74335c5ac978ce upstream.

The rawmidi also allows to obtaining the information via ioctl of ctl
API.  It means that user can issue an ioctl to the rawmidi device even
when it's being removed as long as the control device is present.
Although the code has some protection via the global register_mutex,
its range is limited to the search of the corresponding rawmidi
object, and the mutex is already unlocked at accessing the rawmidi
object.  This may lead to a use-after-free.

For avoiding it, this patch widens the application of register_mutex
to the whole snd_rawmidi_info_select() function.  We have another
mutex per rawmidi object, but this operation isn't very hot path, so
it shouldn't matter from the performance POV.
