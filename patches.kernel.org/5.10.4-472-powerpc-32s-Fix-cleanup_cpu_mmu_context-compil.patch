Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/32s: Fix cleanup_cpu_mmu_context() compile bug
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.4
Git-commit: c1bea0a840ac75dca19bc6aa05575a33eb9fd058

[ Upstream commit c1bea0a840ac75dca19bc6aa05575a33eb9fd058 ]

Currently pmac32_defconfig with SMP=y doesn't build:

  arch/powerpc/platforms/powermac/smp.c:
  error: implicit declaration of function 'cleanup_cpu_mmu_context'

It would be nice for consistency if all platforms clear mm_cpumask and
flush TLBs on unplug, but the TLB invalidation bug described in commit
01b0f0eae081 ("powerpc/64s: Trim offlined CPUs from mm_cpumasks") only
applies to 64s and for now we only have the TLB flush code for that
platform.

So just add an empty version for 32-bit Book3S.
