Subject: [PATCH] vsock/test: add a final full barrier after run all tests
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.7
Git-commit: c39a6a277e0e67ffff6a8efcbbf7e7e23ce9e38c

[ Upstream commit c39a6a277e0e67ffff6a8efcbbf7e7e23ce9e38c ]

If the last test fails, the other side still completes correctly,
which could lead to false positives.

Let's add a final barrier that ensures that the last test has finished
correctly on both sides, but also that the two sides agree on the
number of tests to be performed.
