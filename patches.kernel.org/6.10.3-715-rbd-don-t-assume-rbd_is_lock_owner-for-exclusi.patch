Subject: [PATCH] rbd: don't assume rbd_is_lock_owner() for exclusive mappings
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.3
Git-commit: 3ceccb14f5576e02b81cc8b105ab81f224bd87f6

commit 3ceccb14f5576e02b81cc8b105ab81f224bd87f6 upstream.

Expanding on the previous commit, assuming that rbd_is_lock_owner()
always returns true (i.e. that we are either in RBD_LOCK_STATE_LOCKED
or RBD_LOCK_STATE_QUIESCING) if the mapping is exclusive is wrong too.
In case ceph_cls_set_cookie() fails, the lock would be temporarily
released even if the mapping is exclusive, meaning that we can end up
even in RBD_LOCK_STATE_UNLOCKED.

IOW, exclusive mappings are really "just" about disabling automatic
lock transitions (as documented in the man page), not about grabbing
the lock and holding on to it whatever it takes.
