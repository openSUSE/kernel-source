Subject: [PATCH] perf/arm_pmu_platform: Fix error handling
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.3
Git-commit: e338cb6bef254821a8c095018fd27254d74bfd6a

[ Upstream commit e338cb6bef254821a8c095018fd27254d74bfd6a ]

If we're aborting after failing to register the PMU device,
we probably don't want to leak the IRQs that we've claimed.
