Subject: [PATCH] kexec: fix a memory leak in crash_shrink_memory()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.39
Git-commit: 1cba6c4309f03de570202c46f03df3f73a0d4c82

[ Upstream commit 1cba6c4309f03de570202c46f03df3f73a0d4c82 ]

Patch series "kexec: enable kexec_crash_size to support two crash kernel
regions".

When crashkernel=X fails to reserve region under 4G, it will fall back to
reserve region above 4G and a region of the default size will also be
reserved under 4G.  Unfortunately, /sys/kernel/kexec_crash_size only
supports one crash kernel region now, the user cannot sense the low memory
reserved by reading /sys/kernel/kexec_crash_size.  Also, low memory cannot
be freed by writing this file.

For example:
resource_size(crashk_res) = 512M
resource_size(crashk_low_res) = 256M

The result of 'cat /sys/kernel/kexec_crash_size' is 512M, but it should be
768M.  When we execute 'echo 0 > /sys/kernel/kexec_crash_size', the size
of crashk_res becomes 0 and resource_size(crashk_low_res) is still 256 MB,
which is incorrect.

Since crashk_res manages the memory with high address and crashk_low_res
manages the memory with low address, crashk_low_res is shrunken only when
all crashk_res is shrunken.  And because when there is only one crash
kernel region, crashk_res is always used.  Therefore, if all crashk_res is
shrunken and crashk_low_res still exists, swap them.

This patch (of 6):

If the value of parameter 'new_size' is in the semi-open and semi-closed
interval (crashk_res.end - KEXEC_CRASH_MEM_ALIGN + 1, crashk_res.end], the
calculation result of ram_res is:

	ram_res->start = crashk_res.end + 1
	ram_res->end   = crashk_res.end

The operation of insert_resource() fails, and ram_res is not added to
iomem_resource.  As a result, the memory of the control block ram_res is
leaked.

In fact, on all architectures, the start address and size of crashk_res
are already aligned by KEXEC_CRASH_MEM_ALIGN.  Therefore, we do not need
to round up crashk_res.start again.  Instead, we should round up
'new_size' in advance.
