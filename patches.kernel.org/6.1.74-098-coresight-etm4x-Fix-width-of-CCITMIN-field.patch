Subject: [PATCH] coresight: etm4x: Fix width of CCITMIN field
References: bsc#1218052
Patch-mainline: 6.1.74
Git-commit: cc0271a339cc70cae914c3ec20edc2a8058407da

commit cc0271a339cc70cae914c3ec20edc2a8058407da upstream.

CCITMIN is a 12 bit field and doesn't fit in a u8, so extend it to u16.
This probably wasn't an issue previously because values higher than 255
never occurred.

But since commit 4aff040bcc8d ("coresight: etm: Override TRCIDR3.CCITMIN
on errata affected cpus"), a comparison with 256 was done to enable the
errata, generating the following W=1 build error:

  coresight-etm4x-core.c:1188:24: error: result of comparison of
  constant 256 with expression of type 'u8' (aka 'unsigned char') is
  always false [-Werror,-Wtautological-constant-out-of-range-compare]

   if (drvdata->ccitmin == 256)
