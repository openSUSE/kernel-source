Subject: [PATCH] LoongArch: KVM: Reload guest CSR registers after sleep
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.19
Git-commit: 78d7bc5a02e1468df53896df354fa80727f35b7d

commit 78d7bc5a02e1468df53896df354fa80727f35b7d upstream.

On host, the HW guest CSR registers are lost after suspend and resume
operation. Since last_vcpu of boot CPU still records latest vCPU pointer
so that the guest CSR register skips to reload when boot CPU resumes and
vCPU is scheduled.

Here last_vcpu is cleared so that guest CSR registers will reload from
scheduled vCPU context after suspend and resume.
