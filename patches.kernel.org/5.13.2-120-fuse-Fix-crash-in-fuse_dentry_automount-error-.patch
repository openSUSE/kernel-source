Subject: [PATCH] fuse: Fix crash in fuse_dentry_automount() error path
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.2
Git-commit: d92d88f0568e97c437eeb79d9c9609bd8277406f

commit d92d88f0568e97c437eeb79d9c9609bd8277406f upstream.

If fuse_fill_super_submount() returns an error, the error path
triggers a crash:

[   26.206673] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000
[...]
[   26.226362] RIP: 0010:__list_del_entry_valid+0x25/0x90
[...]
[   26.247938] Call Trace:
[   26.248300]  fuse_mount_remove+0x2c/0x70 [fuse]
[   26.248892]  virtio_kill_sb+0x22/0x160 [virtiofs]
[   26.249487]  deactivate_locked_super+0x36/0xa0
[   26.250077]  fuse_dentry_automount+0x178/0x1a0 [fuse]

The crash happens because fuse_mount_remove() assumes that the FUSE
mount was already added to list under the FUSE connection, but this
only done after fuse_fill_super_submount() has returned success.

This means that until fuse_fill_super_submount() has returned success,
the FUSE mount isn't actually owned by the superblock. We should thus
reclaim ownership by clearing sb->s_fs_info, which will skip the call
to fuse_mount_remove(), and perform rollback, like virtio_fs_get_tree()
already does for the root sb.
