Subject: [PATCH] crypto: AF_ALG - remove SGL terminator indicator when
 chaining
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.13.4
Git-commit: 1e1dfb8b19fd405f6dd05fedf5c9622c64410d8d

Fixed differently upstream as commit 2d97591ef43d ("crypto: af_alg - consolidation of duplicate code")

The SGL is MAX_SGL_ENTS + 1 in size. The last SG entry is used for the
chaining and is properly updated with the sg_chain invocation. During
the filling-in of the initial SG entries, sg_mark_end is called for each
SG entry. This is appropriate as long as no additional SGL is chained
with the current SGL. However, when a new SGL is chained and the last
SG entry is updated with sg_chain, the last but one entry still contains
the end marker from the sg_mark_end. This end marker must be removed as
otherwise a walk of the chained SGLs will cause a NULL pointer
dereference at the last but one SG entry, because sg_next will return
NULL.

The patch only applies to all kernels up to and including 4.13. The
patch 2d97591ef43d0587be22ad1b0d758d6df4999a0b added to 4.14-rc1
introduced a complete new code base which addresses this bug in
a different way. Yet, that patch is too invasive for stable kernels
and was therefore not marked for stable.
