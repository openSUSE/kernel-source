Subject: [PATCH] lib/mpi: call cond_resched() from mpi_powm() loop
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.3
Git-commit: 1d9ddde12e3c9bab7f3d3484eb9446315e3571ca

commit 1d9ddde12e3c9bab7f3d3484eb9446315e3571ca upstream.

On a non-preemptible kernel, if KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE is called with the
largest permitted inputs (16384 bits), the kernel spends 10+ seconds
doing modular exponentiation in mpi_powm() without rescheduling.  If all
threads do it, it locks up the system.  Moreover, it can cause
rcu_sched-stall warnings.

Notwithstanding the insanity of doing this calculation in kernel mode
rather than in userspace, fix it by calling cond_resched() as each bit
from the exponent is processed.  It's still noninterruptible, but at
least it's preemptible now.

Do the cond_resched() once per bit rather than once per MPI limb because
each limb might still easily take 100+ milliseconds on slow CPUs.
