Subject: [PATCH] tty: serial_core: Set port active bit in uart_port_activate
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.5
Git-commit: 13b18d35909707571af9539f7731389fbf0feb31

[ Upstream commit 13b18d35909707571af9539f7731389fbf0feb31 ]

A bug was introduced by commit b3b576461864 ("tty: serial_core: convert
uart_open to use tty_port_open"). It caused a constant warning printed
into the system log regarding the tty and port counter mismatch:

[   21.644197] ttyS ttySx: tty_port_close_start: tty->count = 1 port count = 2

in case if session hangup was detected so the warning is printed starting
from the second open-close iteration.

Particularly the problem was discovered in situation when there is a
serial tty device without hardware back-end being setup. It is considered
by the tty-serial subsystems as a hardware problem with session hang up.
In this case uart_startup() will return a positive value with TTY_IO_ERROR
flag set in corresponding tty_struct instance. The same value will get
passed to be returned from the activate() callback and then being returned
from tty_port_open(). But since in this case tty_port_block_til_ready()
isn't called the TTY_PORT_ACTIVE flag isn't set (while the method had been
called before tty_port_open conversion was introduced and the rest of the
subsystem code expected the bit being set in this case), which prevents the
uart_hangup() method to perform any cleanups including the tty port
counter setting to zero. So the next attempt to open/close the tty device
will discover the counters mismatch.

In order to fix the problem we need to manually set the TTY_PORT_ACTIVE
flag in case if uart_startup() returned a positive value. In this case
the hang up procedure will perform a full set of cleanup actions including
the port ref-counter resetting.
