Subject: [PATCH] dt-binding: cdns,usb3: Fix cdns,on-chip-buff-size type
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.31
Git-commit: 50a1726b148ff30778cb8a6cf3736130b07c93fd

commit 50a1726b148ff30778cb8a6cf3736130b07c93fd upstream.

In cdns3-gadget.c, 'cdns,on-chip-buff-size' was read using
device_property_read_u16(). It resulted in 0 if a 32bit value was used
in dts. This commit fixes the dt binding doc to declare it as u16.
