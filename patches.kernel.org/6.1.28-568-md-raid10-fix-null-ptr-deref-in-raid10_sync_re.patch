Subject: [PATCH] md/raid10: fix null-ptr-deref in raid10_sync_request
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.28
Git-commit: a405c6f0229526160aa3f177f65e20c86fce84c5

commit a405c6f0229526160aa3f177f65e20c86fce84c5 upstream.

init_resync() inits mempool and sets conf->have_replacemnt at the beginning
of sync, close_sync() frees the mempool when sync is completed.

After [1] recovery might be skipped and init_resync() is called but
close_sync() is not. null-ptr-deref occurs with r10bio->dev[i].repl_bio.

The following is one way to reproduce the issue.

  1) create a array, wait for resync to complete, mddev->recovery_cp is set
     to MaxSector.
  2) recovery is woken and it is skipped. conf->have_replacement is set to
     0 in init_resync(). close_sync() not called.
  3) some io errors and rdev A is set to WantReplacement.
  4) a new device is added and set to A's replacement.
  5) recovery is woken, A have replacement, but conf->have_replacemnt is
     0. r10bio->dev[i].repl_bio will not be alloced and null-ptr-deref
     occurs.

Fix it by not calling init_resync() if recovery skipped.
