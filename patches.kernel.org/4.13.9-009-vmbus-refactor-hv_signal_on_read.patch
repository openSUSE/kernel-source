Subject: [PATCH] vmbus: refactor hv_signal_on_read
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.13.9
Git-commit: 8dd45f2ab005a1f3301296059b23b03ec3dbf79b

commit 8dd45f2ab005a1f3301296059b23b03ec3dbf79b upstream.

The function hv_signal_on_read was defined in hyperv.h and
only used in one place in ring_buffer code. Clearer to just
move it inline there.
