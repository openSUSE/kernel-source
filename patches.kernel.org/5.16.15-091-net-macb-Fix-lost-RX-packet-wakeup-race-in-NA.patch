Subject: [PATCH] net: macb: Fix lost RX packet wakeup race in NAPI receive
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.16.15
Git-commit: 0bf476fc3624e3a72af4ba7340d430a91c18cd67

commit 0bf476fc3624e3a72af4ba7340d430a91c18cd67 upstream.

There is an oddity in the way the RSR register flags propagate to the
ISR register (and the actual interrupt output) on this hardware: it
appears that RSR register bits only result in ISR being asserted if the
interrupt was actually enabled at the time, so enabling interrupts with
RSR bits already set doesn't trigger an interrupt to be raised. There
was already a partial fix for this race in the macb_poll function where
it checked for RSR bits being set and re-triggered NAPI receive.
However, there was a still a race window between checking RSR and
actually enabling interrupts, where a lost wakeup could happen. It's
necessary to check again after enabling interrupts to see if RSR was set
just prior to the interrupt being enabled, and re-trigger receive in that
case.

This issue was noticed in a point-to-point UDP request-response protocol
which periodically saw timeouts or abnormally high response times due to
received packets not being processed in a timely fashion. In many
applications, more packets arriving, including TCP retransmissions, would
cause the original packet to be processed, thus masking the issue.
