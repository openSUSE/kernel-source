Subject: [PATCH] x86: i8259: Add missing include file
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.2
Git-commit: 0a957467c5fd46142bc9c52758ffc552d4c5e2f7

commit 0a957467c5fd46142bc9c52758ffc552d4c5e2f7 upstream.

i8259.h uses inb/outb and thus needs to include asm/io.h to avoid the
following build error, as seen with x86_64:defconfig and CONFIG_SMP=n.
