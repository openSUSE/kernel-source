Subject: [PATCH] driver core: Extend device_is_dependent()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.11
Git-commit: 3d1cf435e201d1fd63e4346b141881aed086effd

commit 3d1cf435e201d1fd63e4346b141881aed086effd upstream.

If the device passed as the target (second argument) to
device_is_dependent() is not completely registered (that is, it has
been initialized, but not added yet), but the parent pointer of it
is set, it may be missing from the list of the parent's children
and device_for_each_child() called by device_is_dependent() cannot
be relied on to catch that dependency.

For this reason, modify device_is_dependent() to check the ancestors
of the target device by following its parent pointer in addition to
the device_for_each_child() walk.
