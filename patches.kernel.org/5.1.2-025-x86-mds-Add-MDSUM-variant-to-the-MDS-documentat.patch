Subject: [PATCH] x86/mds: Add MDSUM variant to the MDS documentation
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.2
Git-commit: e672f8bf71c66253197e503f75c771dd28ada4a0

commit e672f8bf71c66253197e503f75c771dd28ada4a0 upstream

Updated the documentation for a new CVE-2019-11091 Microarchitectural Data
Sampling Uncacheable Memory (MDSUM) which is a variant of
Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS). MDS is a family of side channel
attacks on internal buffers in Intel CPUs.

MDSUM is a special case of MSBDS, MFBDS and MLPDS. An uncacheable load from
memory that takes a fault or assist can leave data in a microarchitectural
structure that may later be observed using one of the same methods used by
MSBDS, MFBDS or MLPDS. There are no new code changes expected for MDSUM.
The existing mitigation for MDS applies to MDSUM as well.
