Subject: [PATCH] phy: allwinner: sun4i-usb: poll vbus changes on A23/A33 when
 driving VBUS
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.4
Git-commit: d7119224bfe6e8efbf821a52db7da9530d790f07

commit d7119224bfe6e8efbf821a52db7da9530d790f07 upstream.

The AXP223 PMIC, like the AXP221, does not generate VBUS change
interrupts when N_VBUSEN is used to drive VBUS for the OTG port
on the board.

This was not noticed until recently, as most A23/A33 boards use
a GPIO pin that does not support interrupts for OTG ID detection.
This forces the driver to use polling. However the A33-OlinuXino
uses a pin that does support interrupts, so the driver uses them.
However the VBUS interrupt never fires, and the driver never gets
to update the VBUS status. This results in musb timing out waiting
for VBUS to rise.

This was worked around for the AXP221 by resorting to polling
changes in commit 91d96f06a760 ("phy-sun4i-usb: Add workaround for
missing Vbus det interrupts on A31"). This patch adds the A23 and
A33 to the list of SoCs that need the workaround.

		      sun8i-a33 SoC")
