Subject: [PATCH] ARM: 9321/1: memset: cast the constant byte to unsigned char
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.2
Git-commit: c0e824661f443b8cab3897006c1bbc69fd0e7bc4

[ Upstream commit c0e824661f443b8cab3897006c1bbc69fd0e7bc4 ]

memset() description in ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (and elsewhere) says:

	The memset function copies the value of c (converted to an
	unsigned char) into each of the first n characters of the
	object pointed to by s.

The kernel's arm32 memset does not cast c to unsigned char. This results
in the following code to produce erroneous output:

	char a[128];
	memset(a, -128, sizeof(a));

This is because gcc will generally emit the following code before
it calls memset() :

	mov   r0, r7
	mvn   r1, #127        ; 0x7f
	bl    00000000 <memset>

r1 ends up with 0xffffff80 before being used by memset() and the
'a' array will have -128 once in every four bytes while the other
bytes will be set incorrectly to -1 like this (printing the first
8 bytes) :

	test_module: -128 -1 -1 -1
	test_module: -1 -1 -1 -128

The change here is to 'and' r1 with 255 before it is used.
