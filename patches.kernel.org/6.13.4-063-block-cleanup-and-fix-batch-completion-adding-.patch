Subject: [PATCH] block: cleanup and fix batch completion adding conditions
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.4
Git-commit: 1f47ed294a2bd577d5ae43e6e28e1c9a3be4a833

[ Upstream commit 1f47ed294a2bd577d5ae43e6e28e1c9a3be4a833 ]

The conditions for whether or not a request is allowed adding to a
completion batch are a bit hard to read, and they also have a few
issues. One is that ioerror may indeed be a random value on passthrough,
and it's being checked unconditionally of whether or not the given
request is a passthrough request or not.

Rewrite the conditions to be separate for easier reading, and only check
ioerror for non-passthrough requests. This fixes an issue with bio
unmapping on passthrough, where it fails getting added to a batch. This
both leads to suboptimal performance, and may trigger a potential
schedule-under-atomic condition for polled passthrough IO.

Fixes: f794f3351f26 ("block: add support for blk_mq_end_request_batch()")
