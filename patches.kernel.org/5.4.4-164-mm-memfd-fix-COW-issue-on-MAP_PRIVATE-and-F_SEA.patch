Subject: [PATCH] mm, memfd: fix COW issue on MAP_PRIVATE and
 F_SEAL_FUTURE_WRITE mappings
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.4
Git-commit: 05d351102dbe4e103d6bdac18b1122cd3cd04925

commit 05d351102dbe4e103d6bdac18b1122cd3cd04925 upstream.

F_SEAL_FUTURE_WRITE has unexpected behavior when used with MAP_PRIVATE:
A private mapping created after the memfd file that gets sealed with
F_SEAL_FUTURE_WRITE loses the copy-on-write at fork behavior, meaning
children and parent share the same memory, even though the mapping is
private.

The reason for this is due to the code below:

  static int shmem_mmap(struct file *file, struct vm_area_struct *vma)
  {
        struct shmem_inode_info *info = SHMEM_I(file_inode(file));

        if (info->seals & F_SEAL_FUTURE_WRITE) {
                /*
                 * New PROT_WRITE and MAP_SHARED mmaps are not allowed when
                 * "future write" seal active.
                 */
                if ((vma->vm_flags & VM_SHARED) && (vma->vm_flags & VM_WRITE))
                        return -EPERM;

                /*
                 * Since the F_SEAL_FUTURE_WRITE seals allow for a MAP_SHARED
                 * read-only mapping, take care to not allow mprotect to revert
                 * protections.
                 */
                vma->vm_flags &= ~(VM_MAYWRITE);
        }
        ...
  }

And for the mm to know if a mapping is copy-on-write:

  static inline bool is_cow_mapping(vm_flags_t flags)
  {
        return (flags & (VM_SHARED | VM_MAYWRITE)) == VM_MAYWRITE;
  }

The patch fixes the issue by making the mprotect revert protection
happen only for shared mappings.  For private mappings, using mprotect
will have no effect on the seal behavior.

The F_SEAL_FUTURE_WRITE feature was introduced in v5.1 so v5.3.x stable
kernels would need a backport.
