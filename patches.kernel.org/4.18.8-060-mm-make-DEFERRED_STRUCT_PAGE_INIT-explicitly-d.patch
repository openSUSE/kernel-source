Subject: [PATCH] mm: make DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT explicitly depend on
 SPARSEMEM
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.8
Git-commit: d39f8fb4b7776dcb09ec3bf7a321547083078ee3

[ Upstream commit d39f8fb4b7776dcb09ec3bf7a321547083078ee3 ]

The deferred memory initialization relies on section definitions, e.g
PAGES_PER_SECTION, that are only available when CONFIG_SPARSEMEM=y on
most architectures.

Initially DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT depended on explicit
ARCH_SUPPORTS_DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT configuration option, but since
the commit 2e3ca40f03bb13709df4 ("mm: relax deferred struct page
requirements") this requirement was relaxed and now it is possible to
enable DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT on architectures that support
DISCONTINGMEM and NO_BOOTMEM which causes build failures.

For instance, setting SMP=y and DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT=y on arc
causes the following build failure:

Let's make the DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT explicitly depend on SPARSEMEM
as the systems that support DISCONTIGMEM do not seem to have that huge
amounts of memory that would make DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT relevant.
