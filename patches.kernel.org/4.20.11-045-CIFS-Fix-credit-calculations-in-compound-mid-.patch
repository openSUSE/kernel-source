Subject: [PATCH] CIFS: Fix credit calculations in compound mid callback
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.11
Git-commit: 3d3003fce8e837acc4e3960fe3cbabebc356dcb5

[ Upstream commit 3d3003fce8e837acc4e3960fe3cbabebc356dcb5 ]

The current code doesn't do proper accounting for credits
in SMB1 case: it adds one credit per response only if we get
a complete response while it needs to return it unconditionally.
Fix this and also include malformed responses for SMB2+ into
accounting for credits because such responses have Credit
Granted field, thus nothing prevents to get a proper credit
value from them.
