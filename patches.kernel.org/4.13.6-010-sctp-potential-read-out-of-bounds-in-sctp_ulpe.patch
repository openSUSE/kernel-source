Subject: [PATCH] sctp: potential read out of bounds in
 sctp_ulpevent_type_enabled()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.13.6
Git-commit: fa5f7b51fc3080c2b195fa87c7eca7c05e56f673

[ Upstream commit fa5f7b51fc3080c2b195fa87c7eca7c05e56f673 ]

This code causes a static checker warning because Smatch doesn't trust
anything that comes from skb->data.  I've reviewed this code and I do
think skb->data can be controlled by the user here.

The sctp_event_subscribe struct has 13 __u8 fields and we want to see
if ours is non-zero.  sn_type can be any value in the 0-USHRT_MAX range.
We're subtracting SCTP_SN_TYPE_BASE which is 1 << 15 so we could read
either before the start of the struct or after the end.

This is a very old bug and it's surprising that it would go undetected
for so long but my theory is that it just doesn't have a big impact so
it would be hard to notice.
