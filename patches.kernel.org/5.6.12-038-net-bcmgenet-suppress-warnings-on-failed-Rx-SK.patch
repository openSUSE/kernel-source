Subject: [PATCH] net: bcmgenet: suppress warnings on failed Rx SKB allocations
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.12
Git-commit: ecaeceb8a8a145d93c7e136f170238229165348f

[ Upstream commit ecaeceb8a8a145d93c7e136f170238229165348f ]

The driver is designed to drop Rx packets and reclaim the buffers
when an allocation fails, and the network interface needs to safely
handle this packet loss. Therefore, an allocation failure of Rx
SKBs is relatively benign.

However, the output of the warning message occurs with a high
scheduling priority that can cause excessive jitter/latency for
other high priority processing.

This commit suppresses the warning messages to prevent scheduling
problems while retaining the failure count in the statistics of
the network interface.
