Subject: [PATCH] drm/amdkfd: Fix out-of-bounds read in
 kdf_create_vcrat_image_cpu()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.11
Git-commit: 8b335bff643f3b39935c7377dbcd361c5b605d98

[ Upstream commit 8b335bff643f3b39935c7377dbcd361c5b605d98 ]

KASAN reported a slab-out-of-bounds read of size 1 in
kdf_create_vcrat_image_cpu().

This occurs when, for example, when on an x86_64 with a single NUMA node
because kfd_fill_iolink_info_for_cpu() is a no-op, but afterwards the
sub_type_hdr->length, which is out-of-bounds, is read and multiplied by
entries. Fortunately, entries is 0 in this case so the overall
crat_table->length is still correct.

Check if there were any entries before de-referencing sub_type_hdr which
may be pointing to out-of-bounds memory.

Fixes: b7b6c38529c9 ("drm/amdkfd: Calculate CPU VCRAT size dynamically (v2)")
