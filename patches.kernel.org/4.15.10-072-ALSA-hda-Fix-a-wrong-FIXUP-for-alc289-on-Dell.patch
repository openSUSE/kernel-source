Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda - Fix a wrong FIXUP for alc289 on Dell machines
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.10
Git-commit: d5078193e56bb24f4593f00102a3b5e07bb84ee0

commit d5078193e56bb24f4593f00102a3b5e07bb84ee0 upstream.

With the alc289, the Pin 0x1b is Headphone-Mic, so we should assign
ALC269_FIXUP_DELL4_MIC_NO_PRESENCE rather than
ALC225_FIXUP_DELL1_MIC_NO_PRESENCE to it. And this change is suggested
by Kailang of Realtek and is verified on the machine.
