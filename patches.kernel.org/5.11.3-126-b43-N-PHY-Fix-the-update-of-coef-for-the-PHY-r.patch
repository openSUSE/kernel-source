Subject: [PATCH] b43: N-PHY: Fix the update of coef for the PHY revision >=
 3case
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.3
Git-commit: 4773acf3d4b50768bf08e9e97a204819e9ea0895

[ Upstream commit 4773acf3d4b50768bf08e9e97a204819e9ea0895 ]

The documentation for the PHY update [1] states:

Loop 4 times with index i

    If PHY Revision >= 3
        Copy table[i] to coef[i]
    Otherwise
        Set coef[i] to 0

the copy of the table to coef is currently implemented the wrong way
around, table is being updated from uninitialized values in coeff.
Fix this by swapping the assignment around.
