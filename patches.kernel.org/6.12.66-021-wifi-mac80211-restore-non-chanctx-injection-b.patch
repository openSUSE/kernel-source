Subject: [PATCH] wifi: mac80211: restore non-chanctx injection behaviour
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.66
Git-commit: d594cc6f2c588810888df70c83a9654b6bc7942d

commit d594cc6f2c588810888df70c83a9654b6bc7942d upstream.

During the transition to use channel contexts throughout, the
ability to do injection while in monitor mode concurrent with
another interface was lost, since the (virtual) monitor won't
have a chanctx assigned in this scenario.

It's harder to fix drivers that actually transitioned to using
channel contexts themselves, such as mt76, but it's easy to do
those that are (still) just using the emulation. Do that.
