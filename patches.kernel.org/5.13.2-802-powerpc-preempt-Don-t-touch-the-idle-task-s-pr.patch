Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/preempt: Don't touch the idle task's preempt_count
 during hotplug
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.2
Git-commit: 2c669ef6979c370f98d4b876e54f19613c81e075

commit 2c669ef6979c370f98d4b876e54f19613c81e075 upstream.

Powerpc currently resets a CPU's idle task preempt_count to 0 before
said task starts executing the secondary startup routine (and becomes an
idle task proper).

This conflicts with commit f1a0a376ca0c ("sched/core: Initialize the
idle task with preemption disabled").

which initializes all of the idle tasks' preempt_count to
PREEMPT_DISABLED during smp_init(). Note that this was superfluous
before said commit, as back then the hotplug machinery would invoke
init_idle() via idle_thread_get(), which would have already reset the
CPU's idle task's preempt_count to PREEMPT_ENABLED.

Get rid of this preempt_count write.

Fixes: f1a0a376ca0c ("sched/core: Initialize the idle task with preemption disabled")
