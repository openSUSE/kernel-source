Subject: [PATCH] xfs: refactor buffer logging into buffer dirtying helper
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.13.3
Git-commit: 9684010d38eccda733b61106765e9357cf436f65

commit 9684010d38eccda733b61106765e9357cf436f65 upstream.

xfs_trans_log_buf() is responsible for logging the dirty segments of
a buffer along with setting all of the necessary state on the
transaction, buffer, bli, etc., to ensure that the associated items
are marked as dirty and prepared for I/O. We have a couple use cases
that need to to dirty a buffer in a transaction without actually
logging dirty ranges of the buffer.  One existing use case is
ordered buffers, which are currently logged with arbitrary ranges to
accomplish this even though the content of ordered buffers is never
written to the log. Another pending use case is to relog an already
dirty buffer across rolled transactions within the deferred
operations infrastructure. This is required to prevent a held
(XFS_BLI_HOLD) buffer from pinning the tail of the log.

Refactor xfs_trans_log_buf() into a new function that contains all
of the logic responsible to dirty the transaction, lidp, buffer and
bli. This new function can be used in the future for the use cases
outlined above. This patch does not introduce functional changes.
