Subject: [PATCH] lib/digsig: fix dereference of NULL user_key_payload
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.13.10
Git-commit: 192cabd6a296cbc57b3d8c05c4c89d87fc102506

commit 192cabd6a296cbc57b3d8c05c4c89d87fc102506 upstream.

digsig_verify() requests a user key, then accesses its payload.
However, a revoked key has a NULL payload, and we failed to check for
this.  request_key() *does* skip revoked keys, but there is still a
window where the key can be revoked before we acquire its semaphore.

Fix it by checking for a NULL payload, treating it like a key which was
already revoked at the time it was requested.
