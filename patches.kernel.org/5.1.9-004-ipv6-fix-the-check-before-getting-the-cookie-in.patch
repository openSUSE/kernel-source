Subject: [PATCH] ipv6: fix the check before getting the cookie in
 rt6_get_cookie
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.9
Git-commit: b7999b07726c16974ba9ca3bb9fe98ecbec5f81c

[ Upstream commit b7999b07726c16974ba9ca3bb9fe98ecbec5f81c ]

In Jianlin's testing, netperf was broken with 'Connection reset by peer',
as the cookie check failed in rt6_check() and ip6_dst_check() always
returned NULL.

It's caused by Commit 93531c674315 ("net/ipv6: separate handling of FIB
entries from dst based routes"), where the cookie can be got only when
'c1'(see below) for setting dst_cookie whereas rt6_check() is called
when !'c1' for checking dst_cookie, as we can see in ip6_dst_check().

Since in ip6_dst_check() both rt6_dst_from_check() (c1) and rt6_check()
(!c1) will check the 'from' cookie, this patch is to remove the c1 check
in rt6_get_cookie(), so that the dst_cookie can always be set properly.

c1:
  (rt->rt6i_flags & RTF_PCPU || unlikely(!list_empty(&rt->rt6i_uncached)))
