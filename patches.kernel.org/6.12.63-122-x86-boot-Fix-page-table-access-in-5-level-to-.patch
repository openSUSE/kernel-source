Subject: [PATCH] x86/boot: Fix page table access in 5-level to 4-level paging
 transition
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.63
Git-commit: eb2266312507d7b757859e2227aa5c4ba6280ebe

[ Upstream commit eb2266312507d7b757859e2227aa5c4ba6280ebe ]

When transitioning from 5-level to 4-level paging, the existing code
incorrectly accesses page table entries by directly dereferencing CR3 and
applying PAGE_MASK. This approach has several issues:

- __native_read_cr3() returns the raw CR3 register value, which on x86_64
  includes not just the physical address but also flags. Bits above the
  physical address width of the system i.e. above __PHYSICAL_MASK_SHIFT) are
  also not masked.

- The PGD entry is masked by PAGE_SIZE which doesn't take into account the
  higher bits such as _PAGE_BIT_NOPTISHADOW.

Replace this with proper accessor functions:

- native_read_cr3_pa(): Uses CR3_ADDR_MASK to additionally mask metadata out
  of CR3 (like SME or LAM bits). All remaining bits are real address bits or
  reserved and must be 0.

- mask pgd value with PTE_PFN_MASK instead of PAGE_MASK, accounting for flags
  above bit 51 (_PAGE_BIT_NOPTISHADOW in particular). Bits below 51, but above
  the max physical address are reserved and must be 0.
