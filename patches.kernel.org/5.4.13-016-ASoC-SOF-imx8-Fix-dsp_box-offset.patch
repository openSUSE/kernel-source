Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: SOF: imx8: Fix dsp_box offset
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.13
Git-commit: dcf08d0f8f09081b16f69071dd55d51d5e964e84

commit dcf08d0f8f09081b16f69071dd55d51d5e964e84 upstream.

dsp_box is used to keep DSP initiated messages. The value of dsp_offset
is set by the DSP with the first message, so we need a way to bootstrap
it in order to get the first message.

We do this by setting the correct default dsp_box offset which on i.MX8
is not zero.

Very interesting is why it has worked until now.

On i.MX8, DSP communicates with ARM core using a shared SDRAM memory
area. Actually, there are two shared areas:
	* SDRAM0 - starting at 0x92400000, size 0x800000
	* SDRAM1 - starting at 0x92C00000, size 0x800000

SDRAM0 keeps the data sections, starting with .rodata. By chance
fw_ready structure was placed at the beginning of .rodata.

dsp_box_base is defined as SDRAM0 + dsp_box_offset and it is placed
at the beginning of SDRAM1 (dsp_box_offset should be 0x800000). But
because it is zero initialized by default it points to SDRAM0 where
by chance the fw_ready was placed in the SOF firmware.

Anyhow, SOF commit 7466bee378dd811b ("clk: make freq arrays constant")
fw_ready is no longer at the beginning of SDRAM0 and everything shows
how lucky we were until now.

Fix this by properly setting the default dsp_box offset.
