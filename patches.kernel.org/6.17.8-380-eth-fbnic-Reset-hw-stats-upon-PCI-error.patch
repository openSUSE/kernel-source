Subject: [PATCH] eth: fbnic: Reset hw stats upon PCI error
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.8
Git-commit: b1161b1863c5f3d592adba5accd6e5c79741720f

[ Upstream commit b1161b1863c5f3d592adba5accd6e5c79741720f ]

Upon experiencing a PCI error, fbnic reset the device to recover from
the failure. Reset the hardware stats as part of the device reset to
ensure accurate stats reporting.

Note that the reset is not really resetting the aggregate value to 0,
which may result in a spike for a system collecting deltas in stats.
Rather, the reset re-latches the current value as previous, in case HW
got reset.
