Subject: [PATCH] maple_tree: fix a potential concurrency bug in RCU mode
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.24
Git-commit: c45ea315a602d45569b08b93e9ab30f6a63a38aa

commit c45ea315a602d45569b08b93e9ab30f6a63a38aa upstream.

There is a concurrency bug that may cause the wrong value to be loaded
when a CPU is modifying the maple tree.

CPU1:
mtree_insert_range()
  mas_insert()
    mas_store_root()
      ...
      mas_root_expand()
        ...
        rcu_assign_pointer(mas->tree->ma_root, mte_mk_root(mas->node));
        ma_set_meta(node, maple_leaf_64, 0, slot);    <---IP

CPU2:
mtree_load()
  mtree_lookup_walk()
    ma_data_end();

When CPU1 is about to execute the instruction pointed to by IP, the
ma_data_end() executed by CPU2 may return the wrong end position, which
will cause the value loaded by mtree_load() to be wrong.

An example of triggering the bug:

Add mdelay(100) between rcu_assign_pointer() and ma_set_meta() in
mas_root_expand().

static DEFINE_MTREE(tree);
int work(void *p) {
	unsigned long val;
	for (int i = 0 ; i< 30; ++i) {
		val = (unsigned long)mtree_load(&tree, 8);
		mdelay(5);
		pr_info("%lu",val);
	}
	return 0;
}

mt_init_flags(&tree, MT_FLAGS_USE_RCU);
mtree_insert(&tree, 0, (void*)12345, GFP_KERNEL);
run_thread(work)
mtree_insert(&tree, 1, (void*)56789, GFP_KERNEL);

In RCU mode, mtree_load() should always return the value before or after
the data structure is modified, and in this example mtree_load(&tree, 8)
may return 56789 which is not expected, it should always return NULL.  Fix
it by put ma_set_meta() before rcu_assign_pointer().
