Subject: [PATCH] cacheinfo: Check sib_leaf in cache_leaves_are_shared()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.28
Git-commit: 7a306e3eabf2b2fd8cffa69b87b32dbf814d79ce

[ Upstream commit 7a306e3eabf2b2fd8cffa69b87b32dbf814d79ce ]

If there is no ACPI/DT information, it is assumed that L1 caches
are private and L2 (and higher) caches are shared. A cache is
'shared' between two CPUs if it is accessible from these two
CPUs.

Each CPU owns a representation (i.e. has a dedicated cacheinfo struct)
of the caches it has access to. cache_leaves_are_shared() tries to
identify whether two representations are designating the same actual
cache.

In cache_leaves_are_shared(), if 'this_leaf' is a L2 cache (or higher)
and 'sib_leaf' is a L1 cache, the caches are detected as shared as
only this_leaf's cache level is checked.
This is leads to setting sib_leaf as being shared with another CPU,
which is incorrect as this is a L1 cache.

Check 'sib_leaf->level'. Also update the comment as the function is
called when populating 'shared_cpu_map'.

Fixes: f16d1becf96f ("cacheinfo: Use cache identifiers to check if the caches are shared if available")
