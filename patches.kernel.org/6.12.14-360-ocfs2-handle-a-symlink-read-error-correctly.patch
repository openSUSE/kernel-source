Subject: [PATCH] ocfs2: handle a symlink read error correctly
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.14
Git-commit: 2b4c2094da6d84e69b843dd3317902e977bf64bd

commit 2b4c2094da6d84e69b843dd3317902e977bf64bd upstream.

Patch series "Convert ocfs2 to use folios".

Mark did a conversion of ocfs2 to use folios and sent it to me as a
giant patch for review ;-)

So I've redone it as individual patches, and credited Mark for the patches
where his code is substantially the same.  It's not a bad way to do it;
his patch had some bugs and my patches had some bugs.  Hopefully all our
bugs were different from each other.  And hopefully Mark likes all the
changes I made to his code!


This patch (of 23):
