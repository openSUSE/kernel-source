Subject: [PATCH] mtd: rawnand: marvell: fix the IRQ handler complete()
 condition
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.2
Git-commit: 53c83b59759c1ee213f5ffa194909daee8902a28

commit 53c83b59759c1ee213f5ffa194909daee8902a28 upstream.

With the current implementation, the complete() in the IRQ handler is
supposed to be called only if the register status has one or the other
RDY bit set. Other events might trigger an interrupt as well if
enabled, but should not end-up with a complete() call.

For this purpose, the code was checking if the other bits were set, in
this case complete() was not called. This is wrong as two events might
happen in a very tight time-frame and if the NDSR status read reports
two bits set (eg. RDY(0) and RDDREQ) at the same time, complete() was
not called.

This logic would lead to timeouts in marvell_nfc_wait_op() and has
been observed on PXA boards (NFCv1) in the Hamming write path.
