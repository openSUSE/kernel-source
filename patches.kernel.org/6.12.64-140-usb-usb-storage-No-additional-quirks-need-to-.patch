Subject: [PATCH] usb: usb-storage: No additional quirks need to be added to
 the EL-R12 optical drive.
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.64
Git-commit: 955a48a5353f4fe009704a9a4272a3adf627cd35

[ Upstream commit 955a48a5353f4fe009704a9a4272a3adf627cd35 ]

The optical drive of EL-R12 has the same vid and pid as INIC-3069,
as follows:
T:  Bus=02 Lev=02 Prnt=02 Port=01 Cnt=01 Dev#=  3 Spd=5000 MxCh= 0
D:  Ver= 3.00 Cls=00(>ifc ) Sub=00 Prot=00 MxPS= 9 #Cfgs=  1
P:  Vendor=13fd ProdID=3940 Rev= 3.10
S:  Manufacturer=HL-DT-ST
S:  Product= DVD+-RW GT80N
S:  SerialNumber=423349524E4E38303338323439202020
C:* #Ifs= 1 Cfg#= 1 Atr=80 MxPwr=144mA
I:* If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 2 Cls=08(stor.) Sub=02 Prot=50 Driver=usb-storage
E:  Ad=83(I) Atr=02(Bulk) MxPS=1024 Ivl=0ms
E:  Ad=0a(O) Atr=02(Bulk) MxPS=1024 Ivl=0ms

This will result in the optical drive device also adding
the quirks of US_FL_NO_ATA_1X. When performing an erase operation,
it will fail, and the reason for the failure is as follows:
[  388.967742] sr 5:0:0:0: [sr0] tag#0 Send: scmd 0x00000000d20c33a7
[  388.967742] sr 5:0:0:0: [sr0] tag#0 CDB: ATA command pass through(12)/Blank a1 11 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

[  388.967834] sr 5:0:0:0: [sr0] tag#0 0 sectors total, 0 bytes done.

For the EL-R12 standard optical drive, all operational commands
and usage scenarios were tested without adding the IGNORE_RESIDUE quirks,
and no issues were encountered. It can be reasonably concluded
that removing the IGNORE_RESIDUE quirks has no impact.
