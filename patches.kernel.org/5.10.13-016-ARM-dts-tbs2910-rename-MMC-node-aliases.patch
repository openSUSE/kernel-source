Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: tbs2910: rename MMC node aliases
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.13
Git-commit: fd25c883667b61f845a4188b6be110bb45de0bac

commit fd25c883667b61f845a4188b6be110bb45de0bac upstream.

to be consistent with kernel versions up to v5.9 (mmc aliases not used here).
usdhc1 is not wired up on this board and therefore cannot be used.
Start mmc aliases with usdhc2.
