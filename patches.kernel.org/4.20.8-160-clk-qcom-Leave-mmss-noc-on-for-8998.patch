Subject: [PATCH] clk: qcom: Leave mmss noc on for 8998
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.8
Git-commit: 12eced09cd301aa7b1868a67c50a651c2aacd363

[ Upstream commit 12eced09cd301aa7b1868a67c50a651c2aacd363 ]

Similar to other qcom targets, gcc_mmss_noc_cfg_ahb_clk should not be
disabled.  Any mmss access depends on this clock, and its been observed
that enabling mmssnoc_axi_rpm_clk with rpmcc results in an implicit
access to mmss and will crash the system if gcc_mmss_noc_cfg_ahb_clk is
disabled.
