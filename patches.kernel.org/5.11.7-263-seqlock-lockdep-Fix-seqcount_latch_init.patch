Subject: [PATCH] seqlock,lockdep: Fix seqcount_latch_init()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.7
Git-commit: 4817a52b306136c8b2b2271d8770401441e4cf79

[ Upstream commit 4817a52b306136c8b2b2271d8770401441e4cf79 ]

seqcount_init() must be a macro in order to preserve the static
variable that is used for the lockdep key. Don't then wrap it in an
inline function, which destroys that.

Luckily there aren't many users of this function, but fix it before it
becomes a problem.
