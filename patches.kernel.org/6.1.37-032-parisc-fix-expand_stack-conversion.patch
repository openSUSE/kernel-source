Subject: [PATCH] parisc: fix expand_stack() conversion
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.37
Git-commit: ea3f8272876f2958463992f6736ab690fde7fa9c

commit ea3f8272876f2958463992f6736ab690fde7fa9c upstream.

In commit 8d7071af8907 ("mm: always expand the stack with the mmap write
lock held") I tried to deal with the remaining odd page fault handling
cases.  The oddest one is ia64, which has stacks that grow both up and
down.  And because ia64 was _so_ odd, I asked people to verify the end
result.

But a close second oddity is parisc, which is the only one that has a
main stack growing up (our "CONFIG_STACK_GROWSUP" config option).  But
it looked obvious enough that I didn't worry about it.

I should have worried a bit more.  Not because it was particularly
complex, but because I just used the wrong variable name.

The previous vma isn't called "prev", it's called "prev_vma".  Blush.
