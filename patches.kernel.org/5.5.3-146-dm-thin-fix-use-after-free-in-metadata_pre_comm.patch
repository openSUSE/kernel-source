Subject: [PATCH] dm thin: fix use-after-free in metadata_pre_commit_callback
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.3
Git-commit: a4a8d286586d4b28c8517a51db8d86954aadc74b

commit a4a8d286586d4b28c8517a51db8d86954aadc74b upstream.

dm-thin uses struct pool to hold the state of the pool. There may be
multiple pool_c's pointing to a given pool, each pool_c represents a
loaded target. pool_c's may be created and destroyed arbitrarily and the
pool contains a reference count of pool_c's pointing to it.

Since commit 694cfe7f31db3 ("dm thin: Flush data device before
committing metadata") a pointer to pool_c is passed to
dm_pool_register_pre_commit_callback and this function stores it in
pmd->pre_commit_context. If this pool_c is freed, but pool is not
(because there is another pool_c referencing it), we end up in a
situation where pmd->pre_commit_context structure points to freed
pool_c. It causes a crash in metadata_pre_commit_callback.

Fix this by moving the dm_pool_register_pre_commit_callback() from
pool_ctr() to pool_preresume(). This way the in-core thin-pool metadata
is only ever armed with callback data whose lifetime matches the
active thin-pool target.

In should be noted that this fix preserves the ability to load a
thin-pool table that uses a different data block device (that contains
the same data) -- though it is unclear if that capability is still
useful and/or needed.
