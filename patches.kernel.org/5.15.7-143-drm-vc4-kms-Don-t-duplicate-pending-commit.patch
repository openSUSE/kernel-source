Subject: [PATCH] drm/vc4: kms: Don't duplicate pending commit
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.7
Git-commit: d354699e2292c60f25496d3c31ce4e7b1563b899

commit d354699e2292c60f25496d3c31ce4e7b1563b899 upstream.

Our HVS global state, when duplicated, will also copy the pointer to the
drm_crtc_commit (and increase the reference count) for each FIFO if the
pointer is not NULL.

However, our atomic_setup function will overwrite that pointer without
putting the reference back leading to a memory leak.

Since the commit is only relevant during the atomic commit process, it
doesn't make sense to duplicate the reference to the commit anyway.
Let's remove it.

Fixes: 9ec03d7f1ed3 ("drm/vc4: kms: Wait on previous FIFO users before a commit")
