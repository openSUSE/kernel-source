Subject: [PATCH] md/raid5: fix a race condition in stripe batch
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.13.5
Git-commit: 3664847d95e60a9a943858b7800f8484669740fc

commit 3664847d95e60a9a943858b7800f8484669740fc upstream.

We have a race condition in below scenario, say have 3 continuous stripes, sh1,
sh2 and sh3, sh1 is the stripe_head of sh2 and sh3:

CPU1				CPU2				CPU3
handle_stripe(sh3)
				stripe_add_to_batch_list(sh3)
				-> lock(sh2, sh3)
				-> lock batch_lock(sh1)
				-> add sh3 to batch_list of sh1
				-> unlock batch_lock(sh1)
								clear_batch_ready(sh1)
								-> lock(sh1) and batch_lock(sh1)
								-> clear STRIPE_BATCH_READY for all stripes in batch_list
								-> unlock(sh1) and batch_lock(sh1)
->clear_batch_ready(sh3)
-->test_and_clear_bit(STRIPE_BATCH_READY, sh3)
--->return 0 as sh->batch == NULL
				-> sh3->batch_head = sh1
				-> unlock (sh2, sh3)

In CPU1, handle_stripe will continue handle sh3 even it's in batch stripe list
of sh1. By moving sh3->batch_head assignment in to batch_lock, we make it
impossible to clear STRIPE_BATCH_READY before batch_head is set.

Thanks Stephane for helping debug this tricky issue.
