Subject: [PATCH] KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Drop prepare_done from struct
 kvm_resize_hpt
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.14
Git-commit: 3073774e638ef18d222465fe92bfc8fccb90d288

commit 3073774e638ef18d222465fe92bfc8fccb90d288 upstream.

Currently the kvm_resize_hpt structure has two fields relevant to the
state of an ongoing resize: 'prepare_done', which indicates whether
the worker thread has completed or not, and 'error' which indicates
whether it was successful or not.

Since the success/failure isn't known until completion, this is
confusingly redundant.  This patch consolidates the information into
just the 'error' value: -EBUSY indicates the worked is still in
progress, other negative values indicate (completed) failure, 0
indicates successful completion.

As a bonus this reduces size of struct kvm_resize_hpt by
__alignof__(struct kvm_hpt_info) and saves few bytes of code.

While there correct comment in struct kvm_resize_hpt which references
a non-existent semaphore (leftover from an early draft).

Assert with WARN_ON() in case of HPT allocation thread work runs more
than once for resize request or resize_hpt_allocate() returns -EBUSY
that is treated specially.

Change comparison against zero to make checkpatch.pl happy.
