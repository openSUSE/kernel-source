Subject: [PATCH] ARM: davinci: fix sleep.S build error on ARMv4
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.9
Git-commit: d64b212ea960db4276a1d8372bd98cb861dfcbb0

[ Upstream commit d64b212ea960db4276a1d8372bd98cb861dfcbb0 ]

When building a multiplatform kernel that includes armv4 support,
the default target CPU does not support the blx instruction,
which leads to a build failure:

arch/arm/mach-davinci/sleep.S: Assembler messages:
arch/arm/mach-davinci/sleep.S:56: Error: selected processor does not support `blx ip' in ARM mode

Add a .arch statement in the sources to make this file build.
