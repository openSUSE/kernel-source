Subject: [PATCH] Fix termination state for idr_for_each_entry_ul()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.2
Git-commit: e8ae8ad479e2d037daa33756e5e72850a7bd37a9

[ Upstream commit e8ae8ad479e2d037daa33756e5e72850a7bd37a9 ]

The comment for idr_for_each_entry_ul() states

  after normal termination @entry is left with the value NULL

This is not correct in the case where UINT_MAX has an entry in the idr.
In that case @entry will be non-NULL after termination.
No current code depends on the documentation being correct, but to
save future code we should fix it.

Also fix idr_for_each_entry_continue_ul().  While this is not documented
as leaving @entry as NULL, the mellanox driver appears to depend on
it doing so.  So make that explicit in the documentation as well as in
the code.
