Subject: [PATCH] dm: revert 8f50e358153d ("dm: limit the max bio size as
 BIO_MAX_PAGES * PAGE_SIZE")
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.8
Git-commit: 75ae193626de3238ca5fb895868ec91c94e63b1b

commit 75ae193626de3238ca5fb895868ec91c94e63b1b upstream.

The limit was already incorporated to dm-crypt with commit 4e870e948fba
("dm crypt: fix error with too large bios"), so we don't need to apply
it globally to all targets. The quantity BIO_MAX_PAGES * PAGE_SIZE is
wrong anyway because the variable ti->max_io_len it is supposed to be in
the units of 512-byte sectors not in bytes.

Reduction of the limit to 1048576 sectors could even cause data
corruption in rare cases - suppose that we have a dm-striped device with
stripe size 768MiB. The target will call dm_set_target_max_io_len with
the value 1572864. The buggy code would reduce it to 1048576. Now, the
dm-core will errorneously split the bios on 1048576-sector boundary
insetad of 1572864-sector boundary and pass these stripe-crossing bios
to the striped target.
