Subject: [PATCH] vsock: remove vsock from connected table when connect is
 interrupted by a signal
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.16.11
Git-commit: b9208492fcaecff8f43915529ae34b3bcb03877c

commit b9208492fcaecff8f43915529ae34b3bcb03877c upstream.

vsock_connect() expects that the socket could already be in the
TCP_ESTABLISHED state when the connecting task wakes up with a signal
pending. If this happens the socket will be in the connected table, and
it is not removed when the socket state is reset. In this situation it's
common for the process to retry connect(), and if the connection is
successful the socket will be added to the connected table a second
time, corrupting the list.

Prevent this by calling vsock_remove_connected() if a signal is received
while waiting for a connection. This is harmless if the socket is not in
the connected table, and if it is in the table then removing it will
prevent list corruption from a double add.

Note for backporting: this patch requires d5afa82c977e ("vsock: correct
removal of socket from the list"), which is in all current stable trees
except 4.9.y.
