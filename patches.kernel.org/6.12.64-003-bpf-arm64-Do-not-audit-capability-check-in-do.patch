Subject: [PATCH] bpf, arm64: Do not audit capability check in do_jit()
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.64
Git-commit: 189e5deb944a6f9c7992355d60bffd8ec2e54a9c

[ Upstream commit 189e5deb944a6f9c7992355d60bffd8ec2e54a9c ]

Analogically to the x86 commit 881a9c9cb785 ("bpf: Do not audit
capability check in do_jit()"), change the capable() call to
ns_capable_noaudit() in order to avoid spurious SELinux denials in audit
log.

The commit log from that commit applies here as well:
"""
The failure of this check only results in a security mitigation being
applied, slightly affecting performance of the compiled BPF program. It
doesn't result in a failed syscall, an thus auditing a failed LSM
permission check for it is unwanted. For example with SELinux, it causes
a denial to be reported for confined processes running as root, which
tends to be flagged as a problem to be fixed in the policy. Yet
dontauditing or allowing CAP_SYS_ADMIN to the domain may not be
desirable, as it would allow/silence also other checks - either going
against the principle of least privilege or making debugging potentially
harder.

Fix it by changing it from capable() to ns_capable_noaudit(), which
instructs the LSMs to not audit the resulting denials.
