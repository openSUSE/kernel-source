Subject: [PATCH] pwm: max7360: Populate missing .sizeof_wfhw in
 max7360_pwm_ops

[ Upstream commit 63faf32666e03a78cc985bcbae196418cf7d7938 ]

The sizeof_wfhw field wasn't populated in max7360_pwm_ops so it was set
to 0 by default.
While this is ok for now because:
sizeof(struct max7360_pwm_waveform) < PWM_WFHWSIZE
in the future, if struct max7360_pwm_waveform grows, it could lead to
stack corruption.

Fixes: d93a75d94b79 ("pwm: max7360: Add MAX7360 PWM support")
