Subject: [PATCH] ext4: fix RENAME_WHITEOUT handling for inline directories
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.20
Git-commit: c9f62c8b2dbf7240536c0cc9a4529397bb8bf38e

commit c9f62c8b2dbf7240536c0cc9a4529397bb8bf38e upstream.

A significant number of xfstests can cause ext4 to log one or more
warning messages when they are run on a test file system where the
inline_data feature has been enabled.  An example:

"EXT4-fs warning (device vdc): ext4_dirblock_csum_set:425: inode
 #16385: comm fsstress: No space for directory leaf checksum. Please
run e2fsck -D."

The xfstests include: ext4/057, 058, and 307; generic/013, 051, 068,
070, 076, 078, 083, 232, 269, 270, 390, 461, 475, 476, 482, 579, 585,
589, 626, 631, and 650.

In this situation, the warning message indicates a bug in the code that
performs the RENAME_WHITEOUT operation on a directory entry that has
been stored inline.  It doesn't detect that the directory is stored
inline, and incorrectly attempts to compute a dirent block checksum on
the whiteout inode when creating it.  This attempt fails as a result
of the integrity checking in get_dirent_tail (usually due to a failure
to match the EXT4_FT_DIR_CSUM magic cookie), and the warning message
is then emitted.

Fix this by simply collecting the inlined data state at the time the
search for the source directory entry is performed.  Existing code
handles the rest, and this is sufficient to eliminate all spurious
warning messages produced by the tests above.  Go one step further
and do the same in the code that resets the source directory entry in
the event of failure.  The inlined state should be present in the
"old" struct, but given the possibility of a race there's no harm
in taking a conservative approach and getting that information again
since the directory entry is being reread anyway.
