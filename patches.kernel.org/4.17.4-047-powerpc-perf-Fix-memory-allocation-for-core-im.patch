Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/perf: Fix memory allocation for core-imc based on
 num_possible_cpus()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.4
Git-commit: d2032678e57fc508d7878307badde8f89b632ba3

commit d2032678e57fc508d7878307badde8f89b632ba3 upstream.

Currently memory is allocated for core-imc based on cpu_present_mask,
which has bit 'cpu' set iff cpu is populated. We use (cpu number / threads
per core) as the array index to access the memory.

Under some circumstances firmware marks a CPU as GUARDed CPU and boot the
system, until cleared of errors, these CPU's are unavailable for all
subsequent boots. GUARDed CPUs are possible but not present from linux
view, so it blows a hole when we assume the max length of our allocation
is driven by our max present cpus, where as one of the cpus might be online
and be beyond the max present cpus, due to the hole.
So (cpu number / threads per core) value bounds the array index and leads
to memory overflow.

Call trace observed during a guard test:

Allocating memory for core-imc based on cpu_possible_mask, which has
bit 'cpu' set iff cpu is populatable, will fix this issue.
