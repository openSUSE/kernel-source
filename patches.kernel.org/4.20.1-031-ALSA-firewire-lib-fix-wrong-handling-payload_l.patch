Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: firewire-lib: fix wrong handling payload_length as
 payload_quadlet
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.1
Git-commit: ada79fa5a0b374dd2c2262137c734da7524a8263

commit ada79fa5a0b374dd2c2262137c734da7524a8263 upstream.

In IEC 61883-1/6 engine of ALSA firewire stack, a packet handler has a
second argument for 'the number of bytes in payload of isochronous
packet'. However, an incoming packet handler without CIP header uses the
value as 'the number of quadlets in the payload'. This brings userspace
applications to receive the number of PCM frames as four times against
real time.

This commit fixes the bug.
