Subject: [PATCH] nvme/tcp: fix bug on double requeue when send fails
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.8
Git-commit: 2d570a7c0251c594489a2c16b82b14ae30345c03

[ Upstream commit 2d570a7c0251c594489a2c16b82b14ae30345c03 ]

When nvme_tcp_io_work() fails to send to socket due to
connection close/reset, error_recovery work is triggered
from nvme_tcp_state_change() socket callback.
This cancels all the active requests in the tagset,
which requeues them.

The failed request, however, was ended and thus requeued
individually as well unless send returned -EPIPE.
Another return code to be treated the same way is -ECONNRESET.

Double requeue caused BUG_ON(blk_queued_rq(rq))
in blk_mq_requeue_request() from either the individual requeue
of the failed request or the bulk requeue from
blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter(, nvme_cancel_request, );
