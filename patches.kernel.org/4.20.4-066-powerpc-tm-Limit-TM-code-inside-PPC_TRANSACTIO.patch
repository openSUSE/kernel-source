Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/tm: Limit TM code inside PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.4
Git-commit: 897bc3df8c5aebb54c32d831f917592e873d0559

commit 897bc3df8c5aebb54c32d831f917592e873d0559 upstream.

Commit e1c3743e1a20 ("powerpc/tm: Set MSR[TS] just prior to recheckpoint")
moved a code block around and this block uses a 'msr' variable outside of
the CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM, however the 'msr' variable is declared
inside a CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM block, causing a possible error when
CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTION_MEM is not defined.

	error: 'msr' undeclared (first use in this function)

This is not causing a compilation error in the mainline kernel, because
'msr' is being used as an argument of MSR_TM_ACTIVE(), which is defined as
the following when CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM is *not* set:

	#define MSR_TM_ACTIVE(x) 0

This patch just fixes this issue avoiding the 'msr' variable usage outside
the CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM block, avoiding trusting in the
MSR_TM_ACTIVE() definition.
