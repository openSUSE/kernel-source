Subject: [PATCH] drm/nouveau/disp/dp: respect sink limits when selecting
 failsafe link configuration
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.10
Git-commit: 13d03e9daf70dab032c03dc172e75bb98ad899c4

[ Upstream commit 13d03e9daf70dab032c03dc172e75bb98ad899c4 ]

Where possible, we want the failsafe link configuration (one which won't
hang the OR during modeset because of not enough bandwidth for the mode)
to also be supported by the sink.

This prevents "link rate unsupported by sink" messages when link training
fails.
