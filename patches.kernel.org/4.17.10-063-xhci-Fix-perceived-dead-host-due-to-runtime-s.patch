Subject: [PATCH] xhci: Fix perceived dead host due to runtime suspend race
 with event handler
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.10
Git-commit: 229bc19fd7aca4f37964af06e3583c1c8f36b5d6

commit 229bc19fd7aca4f37964af06e3583c1c8f36b5d6 upstream.

Don't rely on event interrupt (EINT) bit alone to detect pending port
change in resume. If no change event is detected the host may be suspended
again, oterwise roothubs are resumed.

There is a lag in xHC setting EINT. If we don't notice the pending change
in resume, and the controller is runtime suspeded again, it causes the
event handler to assume host is dead as it will fail to read xHC registers
once PCI puts the controller to D3 state.

[  268.520969] xhci_hcd: xhci_resume: starting port polling.
[  268.520985] xhci_hcd: xhci_hub_status_data: stopping port polling.
[  268.521030] xhci_hcd: xhci_suspend: stopping port polling.
[  268.521040] xhci_hcd: // Setting command ring address to 0x349bd001
[  268.521139] xhci_hcd: Port Status Change Event for port 3
[  268.521149] xhci_hcd: resume root hub
[  268.521163] xhci_hcd: port resume event for port 3
[  268.521168] xhci_hcd: xHC is not running.
[  268.521174] xhci_hcd: handle_port_status: starting port polling.
[  268.596322] xhci_hcd: xhci_hc_died: xHCI host controller not responding, assume dead

The EINT lag is described in a additional note in xhci specs 4.19.2:

"Due to internal xHC scheduling and system delays, there will be a lag
between a change bit being set and the Port Status Change Event that it
generated being written to the Event Ring. If SW reads the PORTSC and
sees a change bit set, there is no guarantee that the corresponding Port
Status Change Event has already been written into the Event Ring."
