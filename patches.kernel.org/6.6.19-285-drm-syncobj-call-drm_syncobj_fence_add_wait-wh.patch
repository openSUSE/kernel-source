Subject: [PATCH] drm/syncobj: call drm_syncobj_fence_add_wait when
 WAIT_AVAILABLE flag is set
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.19
Git-commit: 3c43177ffb54ea5be97505eb8e2690e99ac96bc9

[ Upstream commit 3c43177ffb54ea5be97505eb8e2690e99ac96bc9 ]

When waiting for a syncobj timeline point whose fence has not yet been
submitted with the WAIT_FOR_SUBMIT flag, a callback is registered using
drm_syncobj_fence_add_wait and the thread is put to sleep until the
timeout expires. If the fence is submitted before then,
drm_syncobj_add_point will wake up the sleeping thread immediately which
will proceed to wait for the fence to be signaled.

However, if the WAIT_AVAILABLE flag is used instead,
drm_syncobj_fence_add_wait won't get called, meaning the waiting thread
will always sleep for the full timeout duration, even if the fence gets
submitted earlier. If it turns out that the fence *has* been submitted
by the time it eventually wakes up, it will still indicate to userspace
that the wait completed successfully (it won't return -ETIME), but it
will have taken much longer than it should have.

To fix this, we must call drm_syncobj_fence_add_wait if *either* the
WAIT_FOR_SUBMIT flag or the WAIT_AVAILABLE flag is set. The only
difference being that with WAIT_FOR_SUBMIT we will also wait for the
fence to be signaled after it has been submitted while with
WAIT_AVAILABLE we will return immediately.
