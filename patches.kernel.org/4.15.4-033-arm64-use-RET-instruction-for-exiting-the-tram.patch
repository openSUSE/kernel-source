Subject: [PATCH] arm64: use RET instruction for exiting the trampoline
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.4
Git-commit: feace1c8f6eb780adf8d5b6608186a0a76363f6f

Commit be04a6d1126b upstream.

Speculation attacks against the entry trampoline can potentially resteer
the speculative instruction stream through the indirect branch and into
arbitrary gadgets within the kernel.

This patch defends against these attacks by forcing a misprediction
through the return stack: a dummy BL instruction loads an entry into
the stack, so that the predicted program flow of the subsequent RET
instruction is to a branch-to-self instruction which is finally resolved
as a branch to the kernel vectors with speculation suppressed.
