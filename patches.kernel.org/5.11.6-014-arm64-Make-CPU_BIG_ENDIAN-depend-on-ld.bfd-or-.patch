Subject: [PATCH] arm64: Make CPU_BIG_ENDIAN depend on ld.bfd or ld.lld 13.0.0+
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.6
Git-commit: e9c6deee00e9197e75cd6aa0d265d3d45bd7cc28

commit e9c6deee00e9197e75cd6aa0d265d3d45bd7cc28 upstream

Similar to commit 28187dc8ebd9 ("ARM: 9025/1: Kconfig: CPU_BIG_ENDIAN
depends on !LD_IS_LLD"), ld.lld prior to 13.0.0 does not properly
support aarch64 big endian, leading to the following build error when
CONFIG_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN is selected:

ld.lld: error: unknown emulation: aarch64linuxb

This has been resolved in LLVM 13. To avoid errors like this, only allow
CONFIG_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN to be selected if using ld.bfd or ld.lld 13.0.0
and newer.

While we are here, the indentation of this symbol used spaces since its
introduction in commit a872013d6d03 ("arm64: kconfig: allow
CPU_BIG_ENDIAN to be selected"). Change it to tabs to be consistent with
kernel coding style.
