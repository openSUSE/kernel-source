Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx6qdl-mba6: Add missing pvcie-supply regulator
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.31
Git-commit: 91aa4b3782448a7a13baa8cbcdfd5fd19defcbd9

commit 91aa4b3782448a7a13baa8cbcdfd5fd19defcbd9 upstream.

This worked before by coincidence, as the regulator was probed and enabled
before PCI RC probe. But probe order changed since commit 259b93b21a9f
("regulator: Set PROBE_PREFER_ASYNCHRONOUS for drivers that existed in
4.14") and PCIe supply is enabled after RC.
Fix this by adding the regulator to RC node.

The PCIe vaux regulator still needs to be enabled unconditionally for
Mini-PCIe USB-only devices.
