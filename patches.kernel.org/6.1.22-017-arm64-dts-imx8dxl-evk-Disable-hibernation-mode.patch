Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: imx8dxl-evk: Disable hibernation mode of AR8031
 for EQOS
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.22
Git-commit: 0deefb5bd1382aae0aed7c8b266d5088a5308a26

[ Upstream commit 0deefb5bd1382aae0aed7c8b266d5088a5308a26 ]

The hibernation mode of AR8031 PHY defaults to be enabled after hardware
reset. When the cable is unplugged, the PHY will enter hibernation mode
after about 10 senconds and the PHY clocks will be stopped to save
power. However, due to the design of EQOS, the mac needs the RX_CLK of
PHY for software reset to complete. Otherwise the software reset of EQOS
will be failed and do not work correctly. The only way is to disable
hibernation mode of AR8031 PHY for EQOS, the "qca,disable-hibernation-mode"
property is used for this purpose and has already been submitted to the
upstream, for more details please refer to the below link:
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20220818030054.1010660-2-wei.fang@nxp.com/

This issue is easy to reproduce, just unplug the cable and "ifconfig eth0
down", after about 10 senconds, then "ifconfig eth0 up", you will see
failure log on the serial port. The log is shown as following:

After applying this patch, the software reset of EQOS will be
successful. And the log is shown as below.
