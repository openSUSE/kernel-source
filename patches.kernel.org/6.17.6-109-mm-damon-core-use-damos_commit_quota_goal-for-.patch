Subject: [PATCH] mm/damon/core: use damos_commit_quota_goal() for new goal
 commit
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.6
Git-commit: 7eca961dd7188f20fdf8ce9ed5018280f79b2438

commit 7eca961dd7188f20fdf8ce9ed5018280f79b2438 upstream.

When damos_commit_quota_goals() is called for adding new DAMOS quota goals
of DAMOS_QUOTA_USER_INPUT metric, current_value fields of the new goals
should be also set as requested.

However, damos_commit_quota_goals() is not updating the field for the
case, since it is setting only metrics and target values using
damos_new_quota_goal(), and metric-optional union fields using
damos_commit_quota_goal_union().  As a result, users could see the first
current_value parameter that committed online with a new quota goal is
ignored.  Users are assumed to commit the current_value for
DAMOS_QUOTA_USER_INPUT quota goals, since it is being used as a feedback.
Hence the real impact would be subtle.  That said, this is obviously not
intended behavior.

Fix the issue by using damos_commit_quota_goal() which sets all quota goal
parameters, instead of damos_commit_quota_goal_union(), which sets only
the union fields.
