Subject: [PATCH] scsi: target: iscsit: Stop/wait on cmds during conn close
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.28
Git-commit: 395cee83d02de3073211b04fc85724f4abc663ad

[ Upstream commit 395cee83d02de3073211b04fc85724f4abc663ad ]

This fixes a bug added in commit f36199355c64 ("scsi: target: iscsi: Fix
cmd abort fabric stop race").

If we have multiple sessions to the same se_device we can hit a race where
a LUN_RESET on one session cleans up the se_cmds from under another
session which is being closed. This results in the closing session freeing
its conn/session structs while they are still in use.

The bug is:

 1. Session1 has IO se_cmd1.

 2. Session2 can also have se_cmds for I/O and optionally TMRs for ABORTS
    but then gets a LUN_RESET.

 3. The LUN_RESET on session2 sees the se_cmds on session1 and during the
    drain stages marks them all with CMD_T_ABORTED.

 4. session1 is now closed so iscsit_release_commands_from_conn() only sees
    se_cmds with the CMD_T_ABORTED bit set and returns immediately even
    though we have outstanding commands.

 5. session1's connection and session are freed.

 6. The backend request for se_cmd1 completes and it accesses the freed
    connection/session.

This hooks the iscsit layer into the cmd counter code, so we can wait for
all outstanding se_cmds before freeing the connection.
