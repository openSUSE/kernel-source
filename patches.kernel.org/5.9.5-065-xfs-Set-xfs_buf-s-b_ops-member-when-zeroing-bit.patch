Subject: [PATCH] xfs: Set xfs_buf's b_ops member when zeroing bitmap/summary
 files
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.5
Git-commit: c54e14d155f5fdbac73a8cd4bd2678cb252149dc

[ Upstream commit c54e14d155f5fdbac73a8cd4bd2678cb252149dc ]

In xfs_growfs_rt(), we enlarge bitmap and summary files by allocating
new blocks for both files. For each of the new blocks allocated, we
allocate an xfs_buf, zero the payload, log the contents and commit the
transaction. Hence these buffers will eventually find themselves
appended to list at xfs_ail->ail_buf_list.

Later, xfs_growfs_rt() loops across all of the new blocks belonging to
the bitmap inode to set the bitmap values to 1. In doing so, it
allocates a new transaction and invokes the following sequence of
functions,
  - xfs_rtfree_range()
    - xfs_rtmodify_range()
      - xfs_rtbuf_get()
        We pass '&xfs_rtbuf_ops' as the ops pointer to xfs_trans_read_buf().
        - xfs_trans_read_buf()
	  We find the xfs_buf of interest in per-ag hash table, invoke
	  xfs_buf_reverify() which ends up assigning '&xfs_rtbuf_ops' to
	  xfs_buf->b_ops.

On the other hand, if xfs_growfs_rt_alloc() had allocated a few blocks
for the bitmap inode and returned with an error, all the xfs_bufs
corresponding to the new bitmap blocks that have been allocated would
continue to be on xfs_ail->ail_buf_list list without ever having a
non-NULL value assigned to their b_ops members. An AIL flush operation
would then trigger the following warning message to be printed on the
console,

  XFS (loop0): _xfs_buf_ioapply: no buf ops on daddr 0x58 len 8

This message indicates that the xfs_buf had its b_ops member set to
NULL.

This commit fixes the issue by assigning "&xfs_rtbuf_ops" to b_ops
member of each of the xfs_bufs logged by xfs_growfs_rt_alloc().
