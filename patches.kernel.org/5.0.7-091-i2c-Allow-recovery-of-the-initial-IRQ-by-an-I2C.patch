Subject: [PATCH] i2c: Allow recovery of the initial IRQ by an I2C client
 device.
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.7
Git-commit: 93b6604c5a669d84e45fe5129294875bf82eb1ff

[ Upstream commit 93b6604c5a669d84e45fe5129294875bf82eb1ff ]

A previous change allowed I2C client devices to discover new IRQs upon
reprobe by clearing the IRQ in i2c_device_remove. However, if an IRQ was
assigned in i2c_new_device, that information is lost.

For example, the touchscreen and trackpad devices on a Dell Inspiron laptop
are I2C devices whose IRQs are defined by ACPI extended IRQ types. The
client device structures are initialized during an ACPI walk. After
removing the i2c_hid device, modprobe fails.

This change caches the initial IRQ value in i2c_new_device and then resets
the client device IRQ to the initial value in i2c_device_remove.

Fixes: 6f108dd70d30 ("i2c: Clear client->irq in i2c_device_remove")

[wsa: this is an easy to backport fix for the regression. We will
refactor the code to handle irq assignments better in general.]
