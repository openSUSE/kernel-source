Subject: [PATCH] ring-buffer: Fix full_waiters_pending in poll
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.3
Git-commit: 8145f1c35fa648da662078efab299c4467b85ad5

[ Upstream commit 8145f1c35fa648da662078efab299c4467b85ad5 ]

If a reader of the ring buffer is doing a poll, and waiting for the ring
buffer to hit a specific watermark, there could be a case where it gets
into an infinite ping-pong loop.

The poll code has:

  rbwork->full_waiters_pending = true;
  if (!cpu_buffer->shortest_full ||
      cpu_buffer->shortest_full > full)
         cpu_buffer->shortest_full = full;

The writer will see full_waiters_pending and check if the ring buffer is
filled over the percentage of the shortest_full value. If it is, it calls
an irq_work to wake up all the waiters.

But the code could get into a circular loop:

	CPU 0					CPU 1
	-----					-----
 [ Poll ]
   [ shortest_full = 0 ]
   rbwork->full_waiters_pending = true;
					  if (rbwork->full_waiters_pending &&
					      [ buffer percent ] > shortest_full) {
					         rbwork->wakeup_full = true;
					         [ queue_irqwork ]

   cpu_buffer->shortest_full = full;

					  [ IRQ work ]
					  if (rbwork->wakeup_full) {
					        cpu_buffer->shortest_full = 0;
					        wakeup poll waiters;
  [woken]
   if ([ buffer percent ] > full)
      break;
   rbwork->full_waiters_pending = true;
					  if (rbwork->full_waiters_pending &&
					      [ buffer percent ] > shortest_full) {
					         rbwork->wakeup_full = true;
					         [ queue_irqwork ]

   cpu_buffer->shortest_full = full;

					  [ IRQ work ]
					  if (rbwork->wakeup_full) {
					        cpu_buffer->shortest_full = 0;
					        wakeup poll waiters;
  [woken]

 [ Wash, rinse, repeat! ]

In the poll, the shortest_full needs to be set before the
full_pending_waiters, as once that is set, the writer will compare the
current shortest_full (which is incorrect) to decide to call the irq_work,
which will reset the shortest_full (expecting the readers to update it).

Also move the setting of full_waiters_pending after the check if the ring
buffer has the required percentage filled. There's no reason to tell the
writer to wake up waiters if there are no waiters.
