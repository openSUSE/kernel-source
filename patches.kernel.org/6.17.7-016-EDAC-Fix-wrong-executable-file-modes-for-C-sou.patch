Subject: [PATCH] EDAC: Fix wrong executable file modes for C source files
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.7
Git-commit: 71965cae7db394ff5ba3b2d2befe4e136ceec268

[ Upstream commit 71965cae7db394ff5ba3b2d2befe4e136ceec268 ]

Three EDAC source files were mistakenly marked as executable when adding the
EDAC scrub controls.

These are plain C source files and should not carry the executable bit.
Correcting their modes follows the principle of least privilege and avoids
unnecessary execute permissions in the repository.
