Subject: [PATCH] regulator: fixed: fix GPIO descriptor leak on register
 failure
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.59
Git-commit: 636f4618b1cd96f6b5a2b8c7c4f665c8533ecf13

[ Upstream commit 636f4618b1cd96f6b5a2b8c7c4f665c8533ecf13 ]

In the commit referenced by the Fixes tag,
devm_gpiod_get_optional() was replaced by manual
GPIO management, relying on the regulator core to release the
GPIO descriptor. However, this approach does not account for the
error path: when regulator registration fails, the core never
takes over the GPIO, resulting in a resource leak.

Add gpiod_put() before returning on regulator registration failure.
