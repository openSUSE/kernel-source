Subject: [PATCH] dax/kmem: Fix leak of memory-hotplug resources
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: e686c32590f40bffc45f105c04c836ffad3e531a

commit e686c32590f40bffc45f105c04c836ffad3e531a upstream.

While experimenting with CXL region removal the following corruption of
/proc/iomem appeared.

Before:
f010000000-f04fffffff : CXL Window 0
  f010000000-f02fffffff : region4
    f010000000-f02fffffff : dax4.0
      f010000000-f02fffffff : System RAM (kmem)

After (modprobe -r cxl_test):
f010000000-f02fffffff : **redacted binary garbage**
  f010000000-f02fffffff : System RAM (kmem)

...and testing further the same is visible with persistent memory
assigned to kmem:

Before:
480000000-243fffffff : Persistent Memory
  480000000-57e1fffff : namespace3.0
  580000000-243fffffff : dax3.0
    580000000-243fffffff : System RAM (kmem)

After (ndctl disable-region all):
480000000-243fffffff : Persistent Memory
  580000000-243fffffff : ***redacted binary garbage***
    580000000-243fffffff : System RAM (kmem)

The corrupted data is from a use-after-free of the "dax4.0" and "dax3.0"
resources, and it also shows that the "System RAM (kmem)" resource is
not being removed. The bug does not appear after "modprobe -r kmem", it
requires the parent of "dax4.0" and "dax3.0" to be removed which
re-parents the leaked "System RAM (kmem)" instances. Those in turn
reference the freed resource as a parent.

First up for the fix is release_mem_region_adjustable() needs to
reliably delete the resource inserted by add_memory_driver_managed().
That is thwarted by a check for IORESOURCE_SYSRAM that predates the
dax/kmem driver, from commit:

65c78784135f ("kernel, resource: check for IORESOURCE_SYSRAM in release_mem_region_adjustable")

That appears to be working around the behavior of HMM's
"MEMORY_DEVICE_PUBLIC" facility that has since been deleted. With that
check removed the "System RAM (kmem)" resource gets removed, but
corruption still occurs occasionally because the "dax" resource is not
reliably removed.

The dax range information is freed before the device is unregistered, so
the driver can not reliably recall (another use after free) what it is
meant to release. Lastly if that use after free got lucky, the driver
was covering up the leak of "System RAM (kmem)" due to its use of
release_resource() which detaches, but does not free, child resources.
The switch to remove_resource() forces remove_memory() to be responsible
for the deletion of the resource added by add_memory_driver_managed().
