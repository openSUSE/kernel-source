Subject: [PATCH] net: macb: Limit maximum GEM TX length in TSO
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.3
Git-commit: f822e9c4ffa511a5c681cf866287d9383a3b6f1b

[ Upstream commit f822e9c4ffa511a5c681cf866287d9383a3b6f1b ]

GEM_MAX_TX_LEN currently resolves to 0x3FF8 for any IP version supporting
TSO with full 14bits of length field in payload descriptor. But an IP
errata causes false amba_error (bit 6 of ISR) when length in payload
descriptors is specified above 16387. The error occurs because the DMA
falsely concludes that there is not enough space in SRAM for incoming
payload. These errors were observed continuously under stress of large
packets using iperf on a version where SRAM was 16K for each queue. This
errata will be documented shortly and affects all versions since TSO
functionality was added. Hence limit the max length to 0x3FC0 (rounded).
