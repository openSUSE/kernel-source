Subject: [PATCH] mmc: cqhci: Increase recovery halt timeout
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.66
Git-commit: b578d5d18e929aa7c007a98cce32657145dde219

commit b578d5d18e929aa7c007a98cce32657145dde219 upstream.

Failing to halt complicates the recovery. Additionally, unless the card or
controller are stuck, which is expected to be very rare, then the halt
should succeed, so it is better to wait. Set a large timeout.
