Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda - Disable audio component for legacy Nvidia HDMI
 codecs
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.1
Git-commit: 5a858e79c911330678b5a9be91a24830e94a0dc9

commit 5a858e79c911330678b5a9be91a24830e94a0dc9 upstream.

The old Nvidia chips have multiple HD-audio codecs on the same
HD-audio controller, and this doesn't work as expected with the current
audio component binding that is implemented under the one-codec-per-
controller assumption; at the probe time, the driver leads to several
kernel WARNING messages.

For the proper support, we may change the pin2port and port2pin to
traverse the codec list per the given pin number, but this needs more
development and testing.

As a quick workaround, instead, this patch drops the binding in the
audio side for these legacy chips since the audio component support in
nouveau graphics driver is still not merged (hence it's basically
unused).

[ Unlike the original commit, this patch actually disables the audio
  component binding for all Nvidia chips, not only for legacy chips.
  It doesn't matter much, though: nouveau gfx driver still doesn't
  provide the audio component binding on 5.4.y, so it's only a
  placeholder for now.  Also, another difference from the original
  commit is that this removes the nvhdmi_audio_ops and other
  definitions completely in order to avoid a compile warning due to
  unused stuff.  -- tiwai ]
