Subject: [PATCH] drm/xe/guc/ct: Flush g2h worker in case of g2h response
 timeout
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.5
Git-commit: e5152723380404acb8175e0777b1cea57f319a01

[ Upstream commit e5152723380404acb8175e0777b1cea57f319a01 ]

In case if g2h worker doesn't get opportunity to within specified
timeout delay then flush the g2h worker explicitly.

v2:
  - Describe change in the comment and add TODO (Matt B/John H)
  - Add xe_gt_warn on fence done after G2H flush (John H)
v3:
  - Updated the comment with root cause
  - Clean up xe_gt_warn message (John H)
