Subject: [PATCH] scsi: core: Consult supported VPD page list prior to fetching
 page
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.7
Git-commit: b5fc07a5fb56216a49e6c1d0b172d5464d99a89b

commit b5fc07a5fb56216a49e6c1d0b172d5464d99a89b upstream.

Commit c92a6b5d6335 ("scsi: core: Query VPD size before getting full
page") removed the logic which checks whether a VPD page is present on
the supported pages list before asking for the page itself. That was
done because SPC helpfully states "The Supported VPD Pages VPD page
list may or may not include all the VPD pages that are able to be
returned by the device server". Testing had revealed a few devices
that supported some of the 0xBn pages but didn't actually list them in
page 0.

Julian Sikorski bisected a problem with his drive resetting during
discovery to the commit above. As it turns out, this particular drive
firmware will crash if we attempt to fetch page 0xB9.

Various approaches were attempted to work around this. In the end,
reinstating the logic that consults VPD page 0 before fetching any
other page was the path of least resistance. A firmware update for the
devices which originally compelled us to remove the check has since
been released.
