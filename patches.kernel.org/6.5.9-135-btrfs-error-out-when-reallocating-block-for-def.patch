Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: error out when reallocating block for defrag using a
 stale transaction
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.9
Git-commit: e36f94914021e58ee88a8856c7fdf35adf9c7ee1

[ Upstream commit e36f94914021e58ee88a8856c7fdf35adf9c7ee1 ]

At btrfs_realloc_node() we have these checks to verify we are not using a
stale transaction (a past transaction with an unblocked state or higher),
and the only thing we do is to trigger two WARN_ON(). This however is a
critical problem, highly unexpected and if it happens it's most likely due
to a bug, so we should error out and turn the fs into error state so that
such issue is much more easily noticed if it's triggered.

The problem is critical because in btrfs_realloc_node() we COW tree blocks,
and using such stale transaction will lead to not persisting the extent
buffers used for the COW operations, as allocating tree block adds the
range of the respective extent buffers to the ->dirty_pages iotree of the
transaction, and a stale transaction, in the unlocked state or higher,
will not flush dirty extent buffers anymore, therefore resulting in not
persisting the tree block and resource leaks (not cleaning the dirty_pages
iotree for example).

So do the following changes:

1) Return -EUCLEAN if we find a stale transaction;

2) Turn the fs into error state, with error -EUCLEAN, so that no
   transaction can be committed, and generate a stack trace;

3) Combine both conditions into a single if statement, as both are related
   and have the same error message;

4) Mark the check as unlikely, since this is not expected to ever happen.
