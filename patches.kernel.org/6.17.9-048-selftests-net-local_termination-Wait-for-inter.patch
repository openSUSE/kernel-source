Subject: [PATCH] selftests: net: local_termination: Wait for interfaces to
 come up
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.9
Git-commit: 57531b3416448d1ced36a2a974a4085ec43d57b0

[ Upstream commit 57531b3416448d1ced36a2a974a4085ec43d57b0 ]

It seems that most of the tests prepare the interfaces once before the test
run (setup_prepare()), rely on setup_wait() to wait for link and only then
run the test(s).

local_termination brings the physical interfaces down and up during test
run but never wait for them to come up. If the auto-negotiation takes
some seconds, first test packets are being lost, which leads to
false-negative test results.

Use setup_wait() in run_test() to make sure auto-negotiation has been
completed after all simple_if_init() calls on physical interfaces and test
packets will not be lost because of the race against link establishment.
