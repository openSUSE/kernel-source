Subject: [PATCH] mfd: simple-mfd-i2c: Add compatible strings for Layerscape
 QIXIS FPGA
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.8
Git-commit: 81a2c31257411296862487aaade98b7d9e25dc72

[ Upstream commit 81a2c31257411296862487aaade98b7d9e25dc72 ]

The QIXIS FPGA found on Layerscape boards such as LX2160AQDS, LS1028AQDS
etc deals with power-on-reset timing, muxing etc. Use the simple-mfd-i2c
as its core driver by adding its compatible string (already found in
some dt files). By using the simple-mfd-i2c driver, any child device
will have access to the i2c regmap created by it.
