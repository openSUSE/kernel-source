Subject: [PATCH] mm: sections are not offlined during memory hotremove
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.9
Git-commit: 27227c733852f71008e9bf165950bb2edaed3a90

commit 27227c733852f71008e9bf165950bb2edaed3a90 upstream.

Memory hotplug and hotremove operate with per-block granularity.  If the
machine has a large amount of memory (more than 64G), the size of a
memory block can span multiple sections.  By mistake, during hotremove
we set only the first section to offline state.

The bug was discovered because kernel selftest started to fail:
  https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20180423011247.GK5563@yexl-desktop

After commit, "mm/memory_hotplug: optimize probe routine".  But, the bug
is older than this commit.  In this optimization we also added a check
for sections to be in a proper state during hotplug operation.
