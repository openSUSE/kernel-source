Subject: [PATCH] epoll: call final ep_events_available() check under the lock
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.6.14
Git-commit: 65759097d804d2a9ad2b687db436319704ba7019

[ Upstream commit 65759097d804d2a9ad2b687db436319704ba7019 ]

There is a possible race when ep_scan_ready_list() leaves ->rdllist and
->obflist empty for a short period of time although some events are
pending.  It is quite likely that ep_events_available() observes empty
lists and goes to sleep.

Since commit 339ddb53d373 ("fs/epoll: remove unnecessary wakeups of
nested epoll") we are conservative in wakeups (there is only one place
for wakeup and this is ep_poll_callback()), thus ep_events_available()
must always observe correct state of two lists.

The easiest and correct way is to do the final check under the lock.
This does not impact the performance, since lock is taken anyway for
adding a wait entry to the wait queue.

The discussion of the problem can be found here:

   https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fsdevel/a2f22c3c-c25a-4bda-8339-a7bdaf17849e@akamai.com/

In this patch barrierless __set_current_state() is used.  This is safe
since waitqueue_active() is called under the same lock on wakeup side.

Short-circuit for fatal signals (i.e.  fatal_signal_pending() check) is
moved to the line just before actual events harvesting routine.  This is
fully compliant to what is said in the comment of the patch where the
actual fatal_signal_pending() check was added: c257a340ede0 ("fs, epoll:
short circuit fetching events if thread has been killed").
