Subject: [PATCH] pstore/ram: Do not treat empty buffers as valid
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.5
Git-commit: 30696378f68a9e3dad6bfe55938b112e72af00c2

[ Upstream commit 30696378f68a9e3dad6bfe55938b112e72af00c2 ]

The ramoops backend currently calls persistent_ram_save_old() even
if a buffer is empty. While this appears to work, it is does not seem
like the right thing to do and could lead to future bugs so lets avoid
that. It also prevents misleading prints in the logs which claim the
buffer is valid.

I got something like:

	found existing buffer, size 0, start 0

When I was expecting:

	no valid data in buffer (sig = ...)

This bails out early (and reports with pr_debug()), since it's an
acceptable state.
