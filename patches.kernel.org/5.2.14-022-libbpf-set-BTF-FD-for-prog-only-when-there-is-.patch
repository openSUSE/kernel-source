Subject: [PATCH] libbpf: set BTF FD for prog only when there is supported
 .BTF.ext data
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.14
Git-commit: 3415ec643e7bd644b03026efbe2f2b36cbe9b34b

[ Upstream commit 3415ec643e7bd644b03026efbe2f2b36cbe9b34b ]

5d01ab7bac46 ("libbpf: fix erroneous multi-closing of BTF FD")
introduced backwards-compatibility issue, manifesting itself as -E2BIG
error returned on program load due to unknown non-zero btf_fd attribute
value for BPF_PROG_LOAD sys_bpf() sub-command.

This patch fixes bug by ensuring that we only ever associate BTF FD with
program if there is a BTF.ext data that was successfully loaded into
kernel, which automatically means kernel supports func_info/line_info
and associated BTF FD for progs (checked and ensured also by BTF
sanitization code).
