Subject: [PATCH] selftests/damon/damos_quota_goal: handle minimum quota that
 cannot be further reduced
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.19
Git-commit: 349db086a66051bc6114b64b4446787c20ac3f00

commit 349db086a66051bc6114b64b4446787c20ac3f00 upstream.

damos_quota_goal.py selftest see if DAMOS quota goals tuning feature
increases or reduces the effective size quota for given score as expected.
The tuning feature sets the minimum quota size as one byte, so if the
effective size quota is already one, we cannot expect it further be
reduced.  However the test is not aware of the edge case, and fails since
it shown no expected change of the effective quota.  Handle the case by
updating the failure logic for no change to see if it was the case, and
simply skips to next test input.
