commit 49af5d95b9b3c21a84ad115a9db9acbc036d849a upstream.

Comment claims link needs to be retrained because the connected sink raised
a long pulse to indicate link loss. If the sink did so,
intel_dp_hotplug() would have handled link retraining. Looking at the
logs in Bugzilla referenced in commit '3cf71bc9904d ("drm/i915: Re-apply
Perform link quality check, unconditionally during long pulse"")', the
issue is that the sink does not trigger an interrupt. What we want is
->detect() from user space to check link status and retrain. Ville's
review for the original patch also indicates the same root cause. So,
rewrite the comment.

v2: Patch split and rewrote comment.
