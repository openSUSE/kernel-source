Subject: [PATCH] mtd: spi-nor: Fix Cadence QSPI page fault kernel panic
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.9
Git-commit: a6a66f80c85e8e20573ca03fabf32445954a88d5

[ Upstream commit a6a66f80c85e8e20573ca03fabf32445954a88d5 ]

The current Cadence QSPI driver caused a kernel panic sporadically
when writing to QSPI. The problem was caused by writing more bytes
than needed because the QSPI operated on 4 bytes at a time.

On a page boundary limit the number of bytes copied from the tx buffer
to remain within the page.

This patch uses a temporary buffer to hold the 4 bytes to write and then
copies only the bytes required from the tx buffer.
