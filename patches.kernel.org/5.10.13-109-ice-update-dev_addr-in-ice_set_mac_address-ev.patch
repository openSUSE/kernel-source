Subject: [PATCH] ice: update dev_addr in ice_set_mac_address even if HW filter
 exists
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.13
Git-commit: 13ed5e8a9b9ccd140a79e80283f69d724c9bb2be

[ Upstream commit 13ed5e8a9b9ccd140a79e80283f69d724c9bb2be ]

Fix the driver to copy the MAC address configured in ndo_set_mac_address
into dev_addr, even if the MAC filter already exists in HW. In some
situations (e.g. bonding) the netdev's dev_addr could have been modified
outside of the driver, with no change to the HW filter, so the driver
cannot assume that they match.
