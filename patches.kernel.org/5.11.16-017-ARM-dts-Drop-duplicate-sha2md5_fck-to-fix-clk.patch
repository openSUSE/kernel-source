Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: Drop duplicate sha2md5_fck to fix clk_disable race
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.16
Git-commit: 140a776833957539c84301dbdb4c3013876de118

[ Upstream commit 140a776833957539c84301dbdb4c3013876de118 ]

We have a duplicate legacy clock defined for sha2md5_fck that can
sometimes race with clk_disable() with the dts configured clock
for OMAP4_SHA2MD5_CLKCTRL when unused clocks are disabled during
boot causing an "Unhandled fault: imprecise external abort".
