Subject: [PATCH] fs/proc/kcore.c: use probe_kernel_read() instead of memcpy()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.4
Git-commit: d0290bc20d4739b7a900ae37eb5d4cc3be2b393f

commit d0290bc20d4739b7a900ae37eb5d4cc3be2b393f upstream.

Commit df04abfd181a ("fs/proc/kcore.c: Add bounce buffer for ktext
data") added a bounce buffer to avoid hardened usercopy checks.  Copying
to the bounce buffer was implemented with a simple memcpy() assuming
that it is always valid to read from kernel memory iff the
kern_addr_valid() check passed.

A simple, but pointless, test case like "dd if=/proc/kcore of=/dev/null"
now can easily crash the kernel, since the former execption handling on
invalid kernel addresses now doesn't work anymore.

Also adding a kern_addr_valid() implementation wouldn't help here.  Most
architectures simply return 1 here, while a couple implemented a page
table walk to figure out if something is mapped at the address in
question.

With DEBUG_PAGEALLOC active mappings are established and removed all the
time, so that relying on the result of kern_addr_valid() before
executing the memcpy() also doesn't work.

Therefore simply use probe_kernel_read() to copy to the bounce buffer.
This also allows to simplify read_kcore().

At least on s390 this fixes the observed crashes and doesn't introduce
warnings that were removed with df04abfd181a ("fs/proc/kcore.c: Add
bounce buffer for ktext data"), even though the generic
probe_kernel_read() implementation uses uaccess functions.

While looking into this I'm also wondering if kern_addr_valid() could be
completely removed...(?)
