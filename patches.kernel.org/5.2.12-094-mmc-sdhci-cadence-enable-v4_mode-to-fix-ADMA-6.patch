Subject: [PATCH] mmc: sdhci-cadence: enable v4_mode to fix ADMA 64-bit
 addressing
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.12
Git-commit: e73a3896eaca95ea5fc895720502a3f040eb4b39

commit e73a3896eaca95ea5fc895720502a3f040eb4b39 upstream.

The IP datasheet says this controller is compatible with SD Host
Specification Version v4.00.

As it turned out, the ADMA of this IP does not work with 64-bit mode
when it is in the Version 3.00 compatible mode; it understands the
old 64-bit descriptor table (as defined in SDHCI v2), but the ADMA
System Address Register (SDHCI_ADMA_ADDRESS) cannot point to the
64-bit address.

I noticed this issue only after commit bd2e75633c80 ("dma-contiguous:
use fallback alloc_pages for single pages"). Prior to that commit,
dma_set_mask_and_coherent() returned the dma address that fits in
32-bit range, at least for the default arm64 configuration
(arch/arm64/configs/defconfig). Now the host->adma_addr exceeds the
32-bit limit, causing the real problem for the Socionext SoCs.
(As a side-note, I was also able to reproduce the issue for older
kernels by turning off CONFIG_DMA_CMA.)

Call sdhci_enable_v4_mode() to fix this.
