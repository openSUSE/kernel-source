Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: usb-audio: Add quirk for Fiero SC-01
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.13
Git-commit: 4fb7c24f69c48fdc02ea7858dbd5a60ff08bf7e5

[ Upstream commit 4fb7c24f69c48fdc02ea7858dbd5a60ff08bf7e5 ]

Fiero SC-01 is a USB sound card with two mono inputs and a single
stereo output. The inputs are composed into a single stereo stream.

The device uses a vendor-provided driver on Windows and does not work
at all without it. The driver mostly provides ASIO functionality, but
also alters the way the sound card is queried for sample rates and
clocks.

ALSA queries those failing with an EPIPE (same as Windows 10 does).
Presumably, the vendor-provided driver does not query it at all, simply
matching by VID:PID. Thus, I consider this a buggy firmware and adhere
to a set of fixed endpoint quirks instead.

The soundcard has an internal clock. Implicit feedback mode is required
for the playback.

I have updated my device to v1.1.0 from a Windows 10 VM using a vendor-
provided binary prior to the development, hoping for it to just begin
working. The device provides no obvious way to downgrade the firmware,
and regardless, there's no binary available for v1.0.0 anyway.

Thus, I will be getting another unit to extend the patch with support
for that. Expected to be a simple copy-paste of the existing one,
though.

There were no previous reports of that device in context of Linux
anywhere. Other issues have been reported though, but that's out of the
scope.
