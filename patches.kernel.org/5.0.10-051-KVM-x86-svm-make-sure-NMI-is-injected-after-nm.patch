Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: svm: make sure NMI is injected after nmi_singlestep
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.10
Git-commit: 99c221796a810055974b54c02e8f53297e48d146

commit 99c221796a810055974b54c02e8f53297e48d146 upstream.

I noticed that apic test from kvm-unit-tests always hangs on my EPYC 7401P,
the hanging test nmi-after-sti is trying to deliver 30000 NMIs and tracing
shows that we're sometimes able to deliver a few but never all.

When we're trying to inject an NMI we may fail to do so immediately for
various reasons, however, we still need to inject it so enable_nmi_window()
arms nmi_singlestep mode. #DB occurs as expected, but we're not checking
for pending NMIs before entering the guest and unless there's a different
event to process, the NMI will never get delivered.

Make KVM_REQ_EVENT request on the vCPU from db_interception() to make sure
pending NMIs are checked and possibly injected.
