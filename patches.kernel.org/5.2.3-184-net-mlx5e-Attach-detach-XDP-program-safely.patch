Subject: [PATCH] net/mlx5e: Attach/detach XDP program safely
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.3
Git-commit: e18953240de8b46360a67090c87ee1ef8160b35d

[ Upstream commit e18953240de8b46360a67090c87ee1ef8160b35d ]

When an XDP program is set, a full reopen of all channels happens in two
cases:

1. When there was no program set, and a new one is being set.

2. When there was a program set, but it's being unset.

The full reopen is necessary, because the channel parameters may change
if XDP is enabled or disabled. However, it's performed in an unsafe way:
if the new channels fail to open, the old ones are already closed, and
the interface goes down. Use the safe way to switch channels instead.
The same way is already used for other configuration changes.
