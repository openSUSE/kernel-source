Subject: [PATCH] scsi: zfcp: trace HBA FSF response by default on dismiss or
 timedout late response
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.13.4
Git-commit: fdb7cee3b9e3c561502e58137a837341f10cbf8b

commit fdb7cee3b9e3c561502e58137a837341f10cbf8b upstream.

At the default trace level, we only trace unsuccessful events including
FSF responses.

zfcp_dbf_hba_fsf_response() only used protocol status and FSF status to
decide on an unsuccessful response. However, this is only one of multiple
possible sources determining a failed struct zfcp_fsf_req.

An FSF request can also "fail" if its response runs into an ERP timeout
or if it gets dismissed because a higher level recovery was triggered
[trace tags "erscf_1" or "erscf_2" in zfcp_erp_strategy_check_fsfreq()].
FSF requests with ERP timeout are:
FSF_QTCB_EXCHANGE_CONFIG_DATA, FSF_QTCB_EXCHANGE_PORT_DATA,
FSF_QTCB_OPEN_PORT_WITH_DID or FSF_QTCB_CLOSE_PORT or
FSF_QTCB_CLOSE_PHYSICAL_PORT for target ports,
FSF_QTCB_OPEN_LUN, FSF_QTCB_CLOSE_LUN.
One example is slow queue processing which can cause follow-on errors,
e.g. FSF_PORT_ALREADY_OPEN after FSF_QTCB_OPEN_PORT_WITH_DID timed out.
In order to see the root cause, we need to see late responses even if the
channel presented them successfully with FSF_PROT_GOOD and FSF_GOOD.

In case of problems detecting that new responses are waiting on the input
queue, we sooner or later trigger adapter recovery due to an FSF request
timeout (trace tag "fsrth_1").
FSF requests with FSF request timeout are:
typically FSF_QTCB_ABORT_FCP_CMND; but theoretically also
FSF_QTCB_EXCHANGE_CONFIG_DATA or FSF_QTCB_EXCHANGE_PORT_DATA via sysfs,
FSF_QTCB_OPEN_PORT_WITH_DID or FSF_QTCB_CLOSE_PORT for WKA ports,
FSF_QTCB_FCP_CMND for task management function (LUN / target reset).
One or more pending requests can meanwhile have FSF_PROT_GOOD and FSF_GOOD
because the channel filled in the response via DMA into the request's QTCB.

In a theroretical case, inject code can create an erroneous FSF request
on purpose. If data router is enabled, it uses deferred error reporting.
A READ SCSI command can succeed with FSF_PROT_GOOD, FSF_GOOD, and
SAM_STAT_GOOD. But on writing the read data to host memory via DMA,
it can still fail, e.g. if an intentionally wrong scatter list does not
provide enough space. Rather than getting an unsuccessful response,
we get a QDIO activate check which in turn triggers adapter recovery.
One or more pending requests can meanwhile have FSF_PROT_GOOD and FSF_GOOD
because the channel filled in the response via DMA into the request's QTCB.

Only with luck in both above cases, we could see a follow-on trace record
of an unsuccesful event following a successful but late FSF response with
FSF_PROT_GOOD and FSF_GOOD. Typically this was the case for I/O requests
resulting in a SCSI trace record "rsl_err" with DID_TRANSPORT_DISRUPTED
[On ZFCP_STATUS_FSFREQ_DISMISSED, zfcp_fsf_protstatus_eval() sets
ZFCP_STATUS_FSFREQ_ERROR seen by the request handler functions as failure].
However, the reason for this follow-on trace was invisible because the
corresponding HBA trace record was missing at the default trace level
(by default hidden records with tags "fs_norm", "fs_qtcb", or "fs_open").

On adapter recovery, after we had shut down the QDIO queues, we perform
unsuccessful pseudo completions with flag ZFCP_STATUS_FSFREQ_DISMISSED
for each pending FSF request in zfcp_fsf_req_dismiss_all().
In order to find the root cause, we need to see all pseudo responses even
if the channel presented them successfully with FSF_PROT_GOOD and FSF_GOOD.

Therefore, check zfcp_fsf_req.status for ZFCP_STATUS_FSFREQ_DISMISSED
or ZFCP_STATUS_FSFREQ_ERROR and trace with a new tag "fs_rerr".

It does not matter that there are numerous places which set
ZFCP_STATUS_FSFREQ_ERROR after the location where we trace an FSF response
early. These cases are based on protocol status != FSF_PROT_GOOD or
== FSF_PROT_FSF_STATUS_PRESENTED and are thus already traced by default
as trace tag "fs_perr" or "fs_ferr" respectively.

NB: The trace record with tag "fssrh_1" for status read buffers on dismiss
all remains. zfcp_fsf_req_complete() handles this and returns early.
All other FSF request types are handled separately and as described above.
