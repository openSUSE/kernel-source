Subject: [PATCH] dmaengine: rcar-dmac: Check the done lists in
 rcar_dmac_chan_get_residue()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.13
Git-commit: 3e081628d510b2ddbe493371d9c574d9275da17e

[ Upstream commit 3e081628d510b2ddbe493371d9c574d9275da17e ]

This patch fixes an issue that a race condition happens between a client
driver and the rcar-dmac driver:

- The rcar_dmac_isr_transfer_end() is called.
 - The done list appears, and desc.running is the next active list.
- rcar_dmac_chan_get_residue() is called by a client driver before
  rcar_dmac_isr_channel_thread() is called.
 - The rcar_dmac_chan_get_residue() will not find any descriptors.
 - And, the following WARNING happens:
	WARN(1, "No descriptor for cookie!");

The sh-sci driver with HSCIF (921,600bps) on R-Car H3 can cause this
situation.
So, this patch checks the done lists in rcar_dmac_chan_get_residue()
and returns zero if the done lists has the argument cookie.
