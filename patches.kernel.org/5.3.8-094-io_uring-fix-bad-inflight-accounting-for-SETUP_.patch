Subject: [PATCH] io_uring: fix bad inflight accounting for
 SETUP_IOPOLL|SETUP_SQTHREAD
References: bnc#1151927
Patch-mainline: 5.3.8
Git-commit: 2b2ed9750fc9d040b9f6d076afcef6f00b6f1f7c

commit 2b2ed9750fc9d040b9f6d076afcef6f00b6f1f7c upstream.

We currently assume that submissions from the sqthread are successful,
and if IO polling is enabled, we use that value for knowing how many
completions to look for. But if we overflowed the CQ ring or some
requests simply got errored and already completed, they won't be
available for polling.

For the case of IO polling and SQTHREAD usage, look at the pending
poll list. If it ever hits empty then we know that we don't have
anymore pollable requests inflight. For that case, simply reset
the inflight count to zero.
