Subject: [PATCH] xsk: Do not discard packet when NETDEV_TX_BUSY
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.15
Git-commit: 642e450b6b5955f2059d0ae372183f7c6323f951

[ Upstream commit 642e450b6b5955f2059d0ae372183f7c6323f951 ]

In the skb Tx path, transmission of a packet is performed with
dev_direct_xmit(). When NETDEV_TX_BUSY is set in the drivers, it
signifies that it was not possible to send the packet right now,
please try later. Unfortunately, the xsk transmit code discarded the
packet and returned EBUSY to the application. Fix this unnecessary
packet loss, by not discarding the packet in the Tx ring and return
EAGAIN. As EAGAIN is returned to the application, it can then retry
the send operation later and the packet will then likely be sent as
the driver will then likely have space/resources to send the packet.

In summary, EAGAIN tells the application that the packet was not
discarded from the Tx ring and that it needs to call send()
again. EBUSY, on the other hand, signifies that the packet was not
sent and discarded from the Tx ring. The application needs to put
the packet on the Tx ring again if it wants it to be sent.
