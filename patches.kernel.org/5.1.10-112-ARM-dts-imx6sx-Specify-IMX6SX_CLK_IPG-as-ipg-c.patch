Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx6sx: Specify IMX6SX_CLK_IPG as "ipg" clock to
 SDMA
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.10
Git-commit: 8979117765c19edc3b01cc0ef853537bf93eea4b

[ Upstream commit 8979117765c19edc3b01cc0ef853537bf93eea4b ]

Since 25aaa75df1e6 SDMA driver uses clock rates of "ipg" and "ahb"
clock to determine if it needs to configure the IP block as operating
at 1:1 or 1:2 clock ratio (ACR bit in SDMAARM_CONFIG). Specifying both
clocks as IMX6SX_CLK_SDMA results in driver incorrectly thinking that
ratio is 1:1 which results in broken SDMA funtionality. Fix the code
to specify IMX6SX_CLK_IPG as "ipg" clock for SDMA, to avoid detecting
incorrect clock ratio.
