Subject: [PATCH] MIPS: Drop spurious __unused in struct compat_flock
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.7
Git-commit: 6ae1756faddefd7494353380ee546dd38c2f97eb

commit 6ae1756faddefd7494353380ee546dd38c2f97eb upstream.

MIPS' struct compat_flock doesn't match the 32-bit struct flock, as it
has an extra short __unused before pad[4], which combined with alignment
increases the size to 40 bytes compared with struct flock's 36 bytes.

Since commit 8c6657cb50cb ("Switch flock copyin/copyout primitives to
copy_{from,to}_user()"), put_compat_flock() writes the full compat_flock
struct to userland, which results in corruption of the userland word
after the struct flock when running 32-bit userlands on 64-bit kernels.

This was observed to cause a bus error exception when starting Firefox
on Debian 8 (Jessie).
