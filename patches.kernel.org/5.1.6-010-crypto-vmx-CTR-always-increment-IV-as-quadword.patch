Subject: [PATCH] crypto: vmx - CTR: always increment IV as quadword
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.6
Git-commit: 009b30ac7444c17fae34c4f435ebce8e8e2b3250

commit 009b30ac7444c17fae34c4f435ebce8e8e2b3250 upstream.

The kernel self-tests picked up an issue with CTR mode:
alg: skcipher: p8_aes_ctr encryption test failed (wrong result) on test vector 3, cfg="uneven misaligned splits, may sleep"

Test vector 3 has an IV of FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFD, so
after 3 increments it should wrap around to 0.

In the aesp8-ppc code from OpenSSL, there are two paths that
increment IVs: the bulk (8 at a time) path, and the individual
path which is used when there are fewer than 8 AES blocks to
process.

In the bulk path, the IV is incremented with vadduqm: "Vector
Add Unsigned Quadword Modulo", which does 128-bit addition.

In the individual path, however, the IV is incremented with
vadduwm: "Vector Add Unsigned Word Modulo", which instead
does 4 32-bit additions. Thus the IV would instead become
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF00000000, throwing off the result.

Use vadduqm.

This was probably a typo originally, what with q and w being
adjacent. It is a pretty narrow edge case: I am really
impressed by the quality of the kernel self-tests!
