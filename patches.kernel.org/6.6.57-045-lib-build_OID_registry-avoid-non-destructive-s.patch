[ Upstream commit 2fe29fe945637b9834c5569fbb1c9d4f881d8263 ]

On a system with Perl 5.12.1, commit 5ef6dc08cfde
("lib/build_OID_registry: don't mention the full path of the script in
output") causes the build to fail with the error below.

     Bareword found where operator expected at ./lib/build_OID_registry line 41, near "s#^\Q$abs_srctree/\E##r"
     syntax error at ./lib/build_OID_registry line 41, near "s#^\Q$abs_srctree/\E##r"
     Execution of ./lib/build_OID_registry aborted due to compilation errors.
     make[3]: *** [lib/Makefile:352: lib/oid_registry_data.c] Error 255

Ahmad Fatoum analyzed that non-destructive substitution is only supported since
Perl 5.13.2. Instead of dropping `r` and having the side effect of modifying
`$0`, introduce a dedicated variable to support older Perl versions.
