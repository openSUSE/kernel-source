Subject: [PATCH] ceph: force updating the msg pointer in non-split case
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.30
Git-commit: 4cafd0400bcb6187c0d4ab4d4b0229a89ac4f8c2

commit 4cafd0400bcb6187c0d4ab4d4b0229a89ac4f8c2 upstream.

When the MClientSnap reqeust's op is not CEPH_SNAP_OP_SPLIT the
request may still contain a list of 'split_realms', and we need
to skip it anyway. Or it will be parsed as a corrupt snaptrace.
