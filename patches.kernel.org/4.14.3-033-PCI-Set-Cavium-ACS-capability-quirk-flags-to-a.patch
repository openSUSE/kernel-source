Subject: [PATCH] PCI: Set Cavium ACS capability quirk flags to assert
 RR/CR/SV/UF
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.3
Git-commit: 7f342678634f16795892677204366e835e450dda

commit 7f342678634f16795892677204366e835e450dda upstream.

The Cavium ThunderX (CN8XXX) family of PCIe Root Ports does not advertise
an ACS capability.  However, the RTL internally implements similar
protection as if ACS had Request Redirection, Completion Redirection,
Source Validation, and Upstream Forwarding features enabled.

Change Cavium ACS capabilities quirk flags accordingly.
