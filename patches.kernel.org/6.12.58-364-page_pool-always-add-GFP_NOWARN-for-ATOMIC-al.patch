Subject: [PATCH] page_pool: always add GFP_NOWARN for ATOMIC allocations
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.58
Git-commit: f3b52167a0cb23b27414452fbc1278da2ee884fc

[ Upstream commit f3b52167a0cb23b27414452fbc1278da2ee884fc ]

Driver authors often forget to add GFP_NOWARN for page allocation
from the datapath. This is annoying to users as OOMs are a fact
of life, and we pretty much expect network Rx to hit page allocation
failures during OOM. Make page pool add GFP_NOWARN for ATOMIC allocations
by default.
