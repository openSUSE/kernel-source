Subject: [PATCH] sched: Make the idle task quack like a per-CPU kthread
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.2
Git-commit: 00b89fe0197f0c55a045775c11553c0cdb7082fe

[ Upstream commit 00b89fe0197f0c55a045775c11553c0cdb7082fe ]

For all intents and purposes, the idle task is a per-CPU kthread. It isn't
created via the same route as other pcpu kthreads however, and as a result
it is missing a few bells and whistles: it fails kthread_is_per_cpu() and
it doesn't have PF_NO_SETAFFINITY set.

Fix the former by giving the idle task a kthread struct along with the
KTHREAD_IS_PER_CPU flag. This requires some extra iffery as init_idle()
call be called more than once on the same idle task.
