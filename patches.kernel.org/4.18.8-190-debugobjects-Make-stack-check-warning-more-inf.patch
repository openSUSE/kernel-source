Subject: [PATCH] debugobjects: Make stack check warning more informative
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.8
Git-commit: fc91a3c4c27acdca0bc13af6fbb68c35cfd519f2

commit fc91a3c4c27acdca0bc13af6fbb68c35cfd519f2 upstream.

While debugging an issue debugobject tracking warned about an annotation
issue of an object on stack. It turned out that the issue was due to the
object in concern being on a different stack which was due to another
issue.

Thomas suggested to print the pointers and the location of the stack for
the currently running task. This helped to figure out that the object was
on the wrong stack.

As this is general useful information for debugging similar issues, make
the error message more informative by printing the pointers.
