Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm64: Reset the PMU in preemptible context
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.12
Git-commit: ebff0b0e3d3c862c16c487959db5e0d879632559

[ Upstream commit ebff0b0e3d3c862c16c487959db5e0d879632559 ]

We've become very cautious to now always reset the vcpu when nothing
is loaded on the physical CPU. To do so, we now disable preemption
and do a kvm_arch_vcpu_put() to make sure we have all the state
in memory (and that it won't be loaded behind out back).

This now causes issues with resetting the PMU, which calls into perf.
Perf itself uses mutexes, which clashes with the lack of preemption.
It is worth realizing that the PMU is fully emulated, and that
no PMU state is ever loaded on the physical CPU. This means we can
perfectly reset the PMU outside of the non-preemptible section.

Fixes: e761a927bc9a ("KVM: arm/arm64: Reset the VCPU without preemption and vcpu state loaded")
