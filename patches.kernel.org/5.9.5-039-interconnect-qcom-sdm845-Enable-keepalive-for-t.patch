Subject: [PATCH] interconnect: qcom: sdm845: Enable keepalive for the MM1 BCM
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.9.5
Git-commit: 5be1805dc3961ce0465bcb0beab85fe8580af08d

[ Upstream commit 5be1805dc3961ce0465bcb0beab85fe8580af08d ]

After enabling interconnect scaling for display on the db845c board,
in certain configurations the board hangs, while the following errors
are observed on the console:

  Error sending AMC RPMH requests (-110)
  qcom_rpmh TCS Busy, retrying RPMH message send: addr=0x50000
  qcom_rpmh TCS Busy, retrying RPMH message send: addr=0x50000
  qcom_rpmh TCS Busy, retrying RPMH message send: addr=0x50000
  ...

In this specific case, the above is related to one of the sequencers
being stuck, while client drivers are returning from probe and trying
to disable the currently unused clock and interconnect resources.
Generally we want to keep the multimedia NoC enabled like the rest of
the NoCs, so let's set the keepalive flag on it too.
