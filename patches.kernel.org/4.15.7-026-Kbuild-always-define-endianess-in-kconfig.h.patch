Subject: [PATCH] Kbuild: always define endianess in kconfig.h
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.7
Git-commit: 101110f6271ce956a049250c907bc960030577f8

commit 101110f6271ce956a049250c907bc960030577f8 upstream.

Build testing with LTO found a couple of files that get compiled
differently depending on whether asm/byteorder.h gets included early
enough or not.  In particular, include/asm-generic/qrwlock_types.h is
affected by this, but there are probably others as well.

The symptom is a series of LTO link time warnings, including these:

    net/netlabel/netlabel_unlabeled.h:223: error: type of 'netlbl_unlhsh_add' does not match original declaration [-Werror=lto-type-mismatch]
     int netlbl_unlhsh_add(struct net *net,
    net/netlabel/netlabel_unlabeled.c:377: note: 'netlbl_unlhsh_add' was previously declared here

    include/net/ipv6.h:360: error: type of 'ipv6_renew_options_kern' does not match original declaration [-Werror=lto-type-mismatch]
     ipv6_renew_options_kern(struct sock *sk,
    net/ipv6/exthdrs.c:1162: note: 'ipv6_renew_options_kern' was previously declared here

    net/core/dev.c:761: note: 'dev_get_by_name_rcu' was previously declared here
     struct net_device *dev_get_by_name_rcu(struct net *net, const char *name)
    net/core/dev.c:761: note: code may be misoptimized unless -fno-strict-aliasing is used

    drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_drv.h:3377: error: type of 'i915_gem_object_set_to_wc_domain' does not match original declaration [-Werror=lto-type-mismatch]
     i915_gem_object_set_to_wc_domain(struct drm_i915_gem_object *obj, bool write);
    drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem.c:3639: note: 'i915_gem_object_set_to_wc_domain' was previously declared here

    include/linux/debugfs.h:92:9: error: type of 'debugfs_attr_read' does not match original declaration [-Werror=lto-type-mismatch]
     ssize_t debugfs_attr_read(struct file *file, char __user *buf,
    fs/debugfs/file.c:318: note: 'debugfs_attr_read' was previously declared here

    include/linux/rwlock_api_smp.h:30: error: type of '_raw_read_unlock' does not match original declaration [-Werror=lto-type-mismatch]
     void __lockfunc _raw_read_unlock(rwlock_t *lock) __releases(lock);
    kernel/locking/spinlock.c:246:26: note: '_raw_read_unlock' was previously declared here

    include/linux/fs.h:3308:5: error: type of 'simple_attr_open' does not match original declaration [-Werror=lto-type-mismatch]
     int simple_attr_open(struct inode *inode, struct file *file,
    fs/libfs.c:795: note: 'simple_attr_open' was previously declared here

All of the above are caused by include/asm-generic/qrwlock_types.h
failing to include asm/byteorder.h after commit e0d02285f16e
("locking/qrwlock: Use 'struct qrwlock' instead of 'struct __qrwlock'")
in linux-4.15.

Similar bugs may or may not exist in older kernels as well, but there is
no easy way to test those with link-time optimizations, and kernels
before 4.14 are harder to fix because they don't have Babu's patch
series

We had similar issues with CONFIG_ symbols in the past and ended up
always including the configuration headers though linux/kconfig.h.  This
works around the issue through that same file, defining either
__BIG_ENDIAN or __LITTLE_ENDIAN depending on CONFIG_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN,
which is now always set on all architectures since commit 4c97a0c8fee3
("arch: define CPU_BIG_ENDIAN for all fixed big endian archs").
