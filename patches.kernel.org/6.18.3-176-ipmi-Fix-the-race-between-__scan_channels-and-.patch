Subject: [PATCH] ipmi: Fix the race between __scan_channels() and
 deliver_response()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.3
Git-commit: 936750fdba4c45e13bbd17f261bb140dd55f5e93

[ Upstream commit 936750fdba4c45e13bbd17f261bb140dd55f5e93 ]

The race window between __scan_channels() and deliver_response() causes
the parameters of some channels to be set to 0.

1.[CPUA] __scan_channels() issues an IPMI request and waits with
         wait_event() until all channels have been scanned.
         wait_event() internally calls might_sleep(), which might
         yield the CPU. (Moreover, an interrupt can preempt
         wait_event() and force the task to yield the CPU.)
2.[CPUB] deliver_response() is invoked when the CPU receives the
         IPMI response. After processing a IPMI response,
         deliver_response() directly assigns intf->wchannels to
         intf->channel_list and sets intf->channels_ready to true.
         However, not all channels are actually ready for use.
3.[CPUA] Since intf->channels_ready is already true, wait_event()
         never enters __wait_event(). __scan_channels() immediately
         clears intf->null_user_handler and exits.
4.[CPUB] Once intf->null_user_handler is set to NULL, deliver_response()
         ignores further IPMI responses, leaving the remaining
	 channels zero-initialized and unusable.

                                         intf->curr_channel);
   if (condition)
    break;
   __wait_event(wq_head,
          condition);
  } while(0)
 intf->null_user_handler
       = NULL;
                                 deliver_response()
                                  if (!msg->user)
                                   if (intf->null_user_handler)
                                    rv = -EINVAL;
                                  return rv;
-------------------------------  -----------------------------

Fix the race between __scan_channels() and deliver_response() by
deferring both the assignment intf->channel_list = intf->wchannels
and the flag intf->channels_ready = true until all channels have
been successfully scanned or until the IPMI request has failed.
