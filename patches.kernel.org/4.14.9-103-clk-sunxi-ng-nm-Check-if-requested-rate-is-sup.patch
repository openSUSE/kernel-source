Subject: [PATCH] clk: sunxi-ng: nm: Check if requested rate is supported by
 fractional clock
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.9
Git-commit: 4cdbc40d64d4b8303a97e29a52862e4d99502beb

[ Upstream commit 4cdbc40d64d4b8303a97e29a52862e4d99502beb ]

The round_rate callback for N-M-factor style clocks does not check if
the requested clock rate is supported by the fractional clock mode.
While this doesn't affect usage in practice, since the clock rates
are also supported through N-M factors, it does not match the set_rate
code.

Add a check to the round_rate callback so it matches the set_rate
callback.
