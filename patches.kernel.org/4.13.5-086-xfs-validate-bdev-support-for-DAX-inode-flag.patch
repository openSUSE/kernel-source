Subject: [PATCH] xfs: validate bdev support for DAX inode flag
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.13.5
Git-commit: 6851a3db7e224bbb85e23b3c64a506c9e0904382

commit 6851a3db7e224bbb85e23b3c64a506c9e0904382 upstream.

Currently only the blocksize is checked, but we should really be calling
bdev_dax_supported() which also tests to make sure we can get a
struct dax_device and that the dax_direct_access() path is working.

This is the same check that we do for the "-o dax" mount option in
xfs_fs_fill_super().

This does not fix the race issues that caused the XFS DAX inode option to
be disabled, so that option will still be disabled.  If/when we re-enable
it, though, I think we will want this issue to have been fixed.  I also do
think that we want to fix this in stable kernels.
