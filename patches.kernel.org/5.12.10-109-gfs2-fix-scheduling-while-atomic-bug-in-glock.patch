Subject: [PATCH] gfs2: fix scheduling while atomic bug in glocks
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.10
Git-commit: 20265d9a67e40eafd39a8884658ca2e36f05985d

commit 20265d9a67e40eafd39a8884658ca2e36f05985d upstream.

Before this patch, in the unlikely event that gfs2_glock_dq encountered
a withdraw, it would do a wait_on_bit to wait for its journal to be
recovered, but it never released the glock's spin_lock, which caused a
scheduling-while-atomic error.

This patch unlocks the lockref spin_lock before waiting for recovery.

Fixes: 601ef0d52e96 ("gfs2: Force withdraw to replay journals and wait for it to finish")
