Subject: [PATCH] execve: always mark stack as growing down during early stack
 setup
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.38
Git-commit: f66066bc5136f25e36a2daff4896c768f18c211e

commit f66066bc5136f25e36a2daff4896c768f18c211e upstream.

While our user stacks can grow either down (all common architectures) or
up (parisc and the ia64 register stack), the initial stack setup when we
copy the argument and environment strings to the new stack at execve()
time is always done by extending the stack downwards.

But it turns out that in commit 8d7071af8907 ("mm: always expand the
stack with the mmap write lock held"), as part of making the stack
growing code more robust, 'expand_downwards()' was now made to actually
check the vma flags:

	if (!(vma->vm_flags & VM_GROWSDOWN))
		return -EFAULT;

and that meant that this execve-time stack expansion started failing on
parisc, because on that architecture, the stack flags do not contain the
VM_GROWSDOWN bit.

At the same time the new check in expand_downwards() is clearly correct,
and simplified the callers, so let's not remove it.

The solution is instead to just codify the fact that yes, during
execve(), the stack grows down.  This not only matches reality, it ends
up being particularly simple: we already have special execve-time flags
for the stack (VM_STACK_INCOMPLETE_SETUP) and use those flags to avoid
page migration during this setup time (see vma_is_temporary_stack() and
invalid_migration_vma()).

So just add VM_GROWSDOWN to that set of temporary flags, and now our
stack flags automatically match reality, and the parisc stack expansion
works again.

Note that the VM_STACK_INCOMPLETE_SETUP bits will be cleared when the
stack is finalized, so we only add the extra VM_GROWSDOWN bit on
CONFIG_STACK_GROWSUP architectures (ie parisc) rather than adding it in
general.
