Subject: [PATCH] Revert "scsi: sd: Keep disk read-only when re-reading
 partition"
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.6
Git-commit: 8acf608e602f6ec38b7cc37b04c80f1ce9a1a6cc

commit 8acf608e602f6ec38b7cc37b04c80f1ce9a1a6cc upstream.

This reverts commit 20bd1d026aacc5399464f8328f305985c493cde3.

This patch introduced regressions for devices that come online in
read-only state and subsequently switch to read-write.

Given how the partition code is currently implemented it is not
possible to persist the read-only flag across a device revalidate
call. This may need to get addressed in the future since it is common
for user applications to proactively call BLKRRPART.

Reverting this commit will re-introduce a regression where a
device-initiated revalidate event will cause the admin state to be
forgotten. A separate patch will address this issue.
