Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: nVMX: fix x2APIC VTPR read intercept
References: bnc#1012628 CVE-2019-3887 bsc#1131800
Patch-mainline: 5.0.8
Git-commit: c73f4c998e1fd4249b9edfa39e23f4fda2b9b041

commit c73f4c998e1fd4249b9edfa39e23f4fda2b9b041 upstream.

Referring to the "VIRTUALIZING MSR-BASED APIC ACCESSES" chapter of the
SDM, when "virtualize x2APIC mode" is 1 and "APIC-register
virtualization" is 0, a RDMSR of 808H should return the VTPR from the
virtual APIC page.

However, for nested, KVM currently fails to disable the read intercept
for this MSR. This means that a RDMSR exit takes precedence over
"virtualize x2APIC mode", and KVM passes through L1's TPR to L2,
instead of sourcing the value from L2's virtual APIC page.

This patch fixes the issue by disabling the read intercept, in VMCS02,
for the VTPR when "APIC-register virtualization" is 0.

The issue described above and fix prescribed here, were verified with
a related patch in kvm-unit-tests titled "Test VMX's virtualize x2APIC
mode w/ nested".
