Subject: [PATCH] mtd: rawnand: Do not check FAIL bit when executing a
 SET_FEATURES op
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.4
Git-commit: 782d1967d0479ffd59412b2f3179c8bb35f50ff6

commit 782d1967d0479ffd59412b2f3179c8bb35f50ff6 upstream.

The ONFI spec clearly says that FAIL bit is only valid for PROGRAM,
ERASE and READ-with-on-die-ECC operations, and should be ignored
otherwise.

It seems that checking it after sending a SET_FEATURES is a bad idea
because a previous READ, PROGRAM or ERASE op may have failed, and
depending on the implementation, the FAIL bit is not cleared until a
new READ, PROGRAM or ERASE is started.

This leads to ->set_features() returning -EIO while it actually worked,
which can sometimes stop a batch of READ/PROGRAM ops.

Note that we only fix the ->exec_op() path here, because some drivers
are abusing the NAND_STATUS_FAIL flag in their ->waitfunc()
implementation to propagate other kind of errors, like
wait-ready-timeout or controller-related errors. Let's not try to fix
those drivers since they worked fine so far.
