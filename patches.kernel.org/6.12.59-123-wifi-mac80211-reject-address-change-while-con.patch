Subject: [PATCH] wifi: mac80211: reject address change while connecting
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.59
Git-commit: a9da90e618cd0669a22bcc06a96209db5dd96e9b

commit a9da90e618cd0669a22bcc06a96209db5dd96e9b upstream.

While connecting, the MAC address can already no longer be
changed. The change is already rejected if netif_carrier_ok(),
but of course that's not true yet while connecting. Check for
auth_data or assoc_data, so the MAC address cannot be changed.

Also more comprehensively check that there are no stations on
the interface being changed - if any peer station is added it
will know about our address already, so we cannot change it.
