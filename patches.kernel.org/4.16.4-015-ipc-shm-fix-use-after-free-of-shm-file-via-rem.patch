Subject: [PATCH] ipc/shm: fix use-after-free of shm file via
 remap_file_pages()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.4
Git-commit: 3f05317d9889ab75c7190dcd39491d2a97921984

commit 3f05317d9889ab75c7190dcd39491d2a97921984 upstream.

syzbot reported a use-after-free of shm_file_data(file)->file->f_op in
shm_get_unmapped_area(), called via sys_remap_file_pages().

Unfortunately it couldn't generate a reproducer, but I found a bug which
I think caused it.  When remap_file_pages() is passed a full System V
shared memory segment, the memory is first unmapped, then a new map is
created using the ->vm_file.  Between these steps, the shm ID can be
removed and reused for a new shm segment.  But, shm_mmap() only checks
whether the ID is currently valid before calling the underlying file's
->mmap(); it doesn't check whether it was reused.  Thus it can use the
wrong underlying file, one that was already freed.

Fix this by making the "outer" shm file (the one that gets put in
->vm_file) hold a reference to the real shm file, and by making
__shm_open() require that the file associated with the shm ID matches
the one associated with the "outer" file.

Taking the reference to the real shm file is needed to fully solve the
problem, since otherwise sfd->file could point to a freed file, which
then could be reallocated for the reused shm ID, causing the wrong shm
segment to be mapped (and without the required permission checks).

Commit 1ac0b6dec656 ("ipc/shm: handle removed segments gracefully in
shm_mmap()") almost fixed this bug, but it didn't go far enough because
it didn't consider the case where the shm ID is reused.

The following program usually reproduces this bug:

	#include <stdlib.h>
	#include <sys/shm.h>
	#include <sys/syscall.h>
	#include <unistd.h>

	int main()
	{
		int is_parent = (fork() != 0);
		srand(getpid());
		for (;;) {
			int id = shmget(0xF00F, 4096, IPC_CREAT|0700);
			if (is_parent) {
				void *addr = shmat(id, NULL, 0);
				usleep(rand() % 50);
				while (!syscall(__NR_remap_file_pages, addr, 4096, 0, 0, 0));
			} else {
				usleep(rand() % 50);
				shmctl(id, IPC_RMID, NULL);
			}
		}
	}

It causes the following NULL pointer dereference due to a 'struct file'
being used while it's being freed.  (I couldn't actually get a KASAN
use-after-free splat like in the syzbot report.  But I think it's
possible with this bug; it would just take a more extraordinary race...)
