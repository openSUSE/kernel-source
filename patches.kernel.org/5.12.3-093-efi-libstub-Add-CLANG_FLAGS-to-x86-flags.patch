Subject: [PATCH] efi/libstub: Add $(CLANG_FLAGS) to x86 flags
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.3
Git-commit: 58d746c119dfa28e72fc35aacaf3d2a3ac625cd0

[ Upstream commit 58d746c119dfa28e72fc35aacaf3d2a3ac625cd0 ]

When cross compiling x86 on an ARM machine with clang, there are several
errors along the lines of:

  arch/x86/include/asm/page_64.h:52:7: error: invalid output constraint '=D' in asm

This happens because the x86 flags in the EFI stub are not derived from
KBUILD_CFLAGS like the other architectures are and the clang flags that
set the target architecture ('--target=') and the path to the GNU cross
tools ('--prefix=') are not present, meaning that the host architecture
is targeted.

These flags are available as $(CLANG_FLAGS) from the main Makefile so
add them to the cflags for x86 so that cross compiling works as expected.
