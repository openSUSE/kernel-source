Subject: [PATCH] It's wrong to add len to sector_nr in raid10 reshape twice
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.3
Git-commit: b761dcf1217760a42f7897c31dcb649f59b2333e

commit b761dcf1217760a42f7897c31dcb649f59b2333e upstream.

In reshape_request it already adds len to sector_nr already. It's wrong to add len to
sector_nr again after adding pages to bio. If there is bad block it can't copy one chunk
at a time, it needs to goto read_more. Now the sector_nr is wrong. It can cause data
corruption.
