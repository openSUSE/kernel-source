Subject: [PATCH] mfd: cros ec: spi: Don't send first message too soon
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.10
Git-commit: 15d8374874ded0bec37ef27f8301a6d54032c0e5

commit 15d8374874ded0bec37ef27f8301a6d54032c0e5 upstream.

On the Tegra124 Nyan-Big chromebook the very first SPI message sent to
the EC is failing.

The Tegra SPI driver configures the SPI chip-selects to be active-high
by default (and always has for many years). The EC SPI requires an
active-low chip-select and so the Tegra chip-select is reconfigured to
be active-low when the EC SPI driver calls spi_setup(). The problem is
that if the first SPI message to the EC is sent too soon after
reconfiguring the SPI chip-select, it fails.

The EC SPI driver prevents back-to-back SPI messages being sent too
soon by keeping track of the time the last transfer was sent via the
variable 'last_transfer_ns'. To prevent the very first transfer being
sent too soon, initialise the 'last_transfer_ns' variable after calling
spi_setup() and before sending the first SPI message.
