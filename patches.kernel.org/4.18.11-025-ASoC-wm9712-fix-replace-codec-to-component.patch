Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: wm9712: fix replace codec to component
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.11
Git-commit: 5e4cfadaf5b73a0801b2fa7fb007f98400ebfe6e

commit 5e4cfadaf5b73a0801b2fa7fb007f98400ebfe6e upstream.

Since commit 143b44845d87 ("ASoC: wm9712: replace codec to component")
"wm9712-codec" got renamed to "wm9712-component", however, this change
never got propagated down to the actual board/platform drivers. E.g. on
Colibri T20 this lead to the following spew upon boot with sound/touch
being broken:

This commit finally fixes this again.
