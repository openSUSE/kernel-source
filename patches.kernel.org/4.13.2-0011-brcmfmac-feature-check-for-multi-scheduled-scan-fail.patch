Subject: [PATCH] brcmfmac: feature check for multi-scheduled scan fails on
 bcm4345 devices
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.13.2
Git-commit: f957dd3c8db2781c8a334b166800788feb618625

commit f957dd3c8db2781c8a334b166800788feb618625 upstream.

The firmware feature check introduced for multi-scheduled scan is also
failing for bcm4345 devices resulting in a firmware crash.
The reason for this crash has not yet been root cause so this patch avoids
the feature check for those device as a short-term fix.
