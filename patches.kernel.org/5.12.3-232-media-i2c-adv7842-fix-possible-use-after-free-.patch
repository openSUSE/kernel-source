Subject: [PATCH] media: i2c: adv7842: fix possible use-after-free in
 adv7842_remove()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.3
Git-commit: 4a15275b6a18597079f18241c87511406575179a

[ Upstream commit 4a15275b6a18597079f18241c87511406575179a ]

This driver's remove path calls cancel_delayed_work(). However, that
function does not wait until the work function finishes. This means
that the callback function may still be running after the driver's
remove function has finished, which would result in a use-after-free.

Fix by calling cancel_delayed_work_sync(), which ensures that
the work is properly cancelled, no longer running, and unable
to re-schedule itself.
