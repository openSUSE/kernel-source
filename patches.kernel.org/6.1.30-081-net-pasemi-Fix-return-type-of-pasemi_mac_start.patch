Subject: [PATCH] net: pasemi: Fix return type of pasemi_mac_start_tx()
References: bsc#1012628

[ Upstream commit c8384d4a51e7cb0e6587f3143f29099f202c5de1 ]

With clang's kernel control flow integrity (kCFI, CONFIG_CFI_CLANG),
indirect call targets are validated against the expected function
pointer prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigate
ROP attacks. If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,
which manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed. A
warning in clang aims to catch these at compile time, which reveals:

  drivers/net/ethernet/pasemi/pasemi_mac.c:1665:21: error: incompatible function pointer types initializing 'netdev_tx_t (*)(struct sk_buff *, struct net_device *)' (aka 'enum netdev_tx (*)(struct sk_buff *, struct net_device *)') with an expression of type 'int (struct sk_buff *, struct net_device *)' [-Werror,-Wincompatible-function-pointer-types-strict]
          .ndo_start_xmit         = pasemi_mac_start_tx,
                                    ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  1 error generated.

->ndo_start_xmit() in 'struct net_device_ops' expects a return type of
'netdev_tx_t', not 'int'. Adjust the return type of
pasemi_mac_start_tx() to match the prototype's to resolve the warning.
While PowerPC does not currently implement support for kCFI, it could in
the future, which means this warning becomes a fatal CFI failure at run
time.
