Subject: [PATCH] clk: ingenic/jz4740: Fix "pll half" divider not read/written
 properly
References: bnc#1151927
Patch-mainline: 5.3.5
Git-commit: 568b9de48d80bcf1a92e2c4fa67651abbb8ebfe2

[ Upstream commit 568b9de48d80bcf1a92e2c4fa67651abbb8ebfe2 ]

The code was setting the bit 21 of the CPCCR register to use a divider
of 2 for the "pll half" clock, and clearing the bit to use a divider
of 1.

This is the opposite of how this register field works: a cleared bit
means that the /2 divider is used, and a set bit means that the divider
is 1.

Restore the correct behaviour using the newly introduced .div_table
field.
