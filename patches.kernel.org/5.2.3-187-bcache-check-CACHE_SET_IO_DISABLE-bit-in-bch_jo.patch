Subject: [PATCH] bcache: check CACHE_SET_IO_DISABLE bit in bch_journal()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.3
Git-commit: 383ff2183ad16a8842d1fbd9dd3e1cbd66813e64

[ Upstream commit 383ff2183ad16a8842d1fbd9dd3e1cbd66813e64 ]

When too many I/O errors happen on cache set and CACHE_SET_IO_DISABLE
bit is set, bch_journal() may continue to work because the journaling
bkey might be still in write set yet. The caller of bch_journal() may
believe the journal still work but the truth is in-memory journal write
set won't be written into cache device any more. This behavior may
introduce potential inconsistent metadata status.

This patch checks CACHE_SET_IO_DISABLE bit at the head of bch_journal(),
if the bit is set, bch_journal() returns NULL immediately to notice
caller to know journal does not work.
