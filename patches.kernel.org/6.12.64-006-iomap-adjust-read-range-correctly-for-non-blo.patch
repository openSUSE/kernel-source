Subject: [PATCH] iomap: adjust read range correctly for non-block-aligned
 positions
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.64
Git-commit: 7aa6bc3e8766990824f66ca76c19596ce10daf3e

[ Upstream commit 7aa6bc3e8766990824f66ca76c19596ce10daf3e ]

iomap_adjust_read_range() assumes that the position and length passed in
are block-aligned. This is not always the case however, as shown in the
syzbot generated case for erofs. This causes too many bytes to be
skipped for uptodate blocks, which results in returning the incorrect
position and length to read in. If all the blocks are uptodate, this
underflows length and returns a position beyond the folio.

Fix the calculation to also take into account the block offset when
calculating how many bytes can be skipped for uptodate blocks.
