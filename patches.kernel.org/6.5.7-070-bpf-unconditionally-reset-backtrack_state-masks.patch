Subject: [PATCH] bpf: unconditionally reset backtrack_state masks on global
 func exit
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.7
Git-commit: 81335f90e8a88b81932df011105c46e708744f44

[ Upstream commit 81335f90e8a88b81932df011105c46e708744f44 ]

In mark_chain_precision() logic, when we reach the entry to a global
func, it is expected that R1-R5 might be still requested to be marked
precise. This would correspond to some integer input arguments being
tracked as precise. This is all expected and handled as a special case.

What's not expected is that we'll leave backtrack_state structure with
some register bits set. This is because for subsequent precision
propagations backtrack_state is reused without clearing masks, as all
code paths are carefully written in a way to leave empty backtrack_state
with zeroed out masks, for speed.

The fix is trivial, we always clear register bit in the register mask, and
then, optionally, set reg->precise if register is SCALAR_VALUE type.
