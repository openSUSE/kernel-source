Subject: [PATCH] Revert "selftests: firmware: remove use of non-standard diff
 -Z option"
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.1
Git-commit: 13ac7db09c914e4991a08b7ad578267d5cdd9856

commit 13ac7db09c914e4991a08b7ad578267d5cdd9856 upstream.

This reverts commit f70b472e937bb659a7b7a14e64f07308e230888c.

This breaks testing on Debian, and this patch was NACKed anyway.
The proper way to address this is a quirk for busybox as that is
where the issue is present.
