Subject: [PATCH] drm/v3d: Fix prime imports of buffers from other drivers.
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.8
Git-commit: 62d1a752874962f072de8a779e960fcd2ab4847b

[ Upstream commit 62d1a752874962f072de8a779e960fcd2ab4847b ]

v3d_bo_get_pages() checks this to decide to map the imported buffer
instead of the backing shmem file.  The caller was about to set this
value anyway, and there's no error path in between.  Ideally we
wouldn't even allocate the shmem file for our imports, but that's a
more invasive fix.
