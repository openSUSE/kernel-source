Subject: [PATCH] cifs: don't try to use rdma offload on encrypted connections
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: 3891f6c7655a39065e44980f51ba46bb32be3133

commit 3891f6c7655a39065e44980f51ba46bb32be3133 upstream.

The aim of using encryption on a connection is to keep
the data confidential, so we must not use plaintext rdma offload
for that data!

It seems that current windows servers and ksmbd would allow
this, but that's no reason to expose the users data in plaintext!
And servers hopefully reject this in future.

Note modern windows servers support signed or encrypted offload,
see MS-SMB2 2.2.3.1.6 SMB2_RDMA_TRANSFORM_CAPABILITIES, but we don't
support that yet.
