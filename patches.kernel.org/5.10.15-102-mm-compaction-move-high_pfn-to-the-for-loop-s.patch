Subject: [PATCH] mm, compaction: move high_pfn to the for loop scope
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.15
Git-commit: 74e21484e40bb8ce0f9828bbfe1c9fc9b04249c6

commit 74e21484e40bb8ce0f9828bbfe1c9fc9b04249c6 upstream.

In fast_isolate_freepages, high_pfn will be used if a prefered one (ie
PFN >= low_fn) not found.

But the high_pfn is not reset before searching an free area, so when it
was used as freepage, it may from another free area searched before.  As
a result move_freelist_head(freelist, freepage) will have unexpected
behavior (eg corrupt the MOVABLE freelist)

The issue was reported on an smart phone product with 6GB ram and 3GB
zram as swap device.

This patch fixes the issue by reset high_pfn before searching each free
area, which ensure freepage and freelist match when call
move_freelist_head in fast_isolate_freepages().
