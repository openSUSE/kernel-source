Subject: [PATCH] selftests/tracing: Run sample events to clear page cache
 events
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.59
Git-commit: dd4adb986a86727ed8f56c48b6d0695f1e211e65

commit dd4adb986a86727ed8f56c48b6d0695f1e211e65 upstream.

The tracing selftest "event-filter-function.tc" was failing because it
first runs the "sample_events" function that triggers the kmem_cache_free
event and it looks at what function was used during a call to "ls".

But the first time it calls this, it could trigger events that are used to
pull pages into the page cache.

The rest of the test uses the function it finds during that call to see if
it will be called in subsequent "sample_events" calls. But if there's no
need to pull pages into the page cache, it will not trigger that function
and the test will fail.

Call the "sample_events" twice to trigger all the page cache work before
it calls it to find a function to use in subsequent checks.
