Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/64s/syscall: Use pt_regs.trap to distinguish syscall
 ABI difference between sc and scv syscalls
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.12.7
Git-commit: 5665bc35c1ed917ac8fd06cb651317bb47a65b10

commit 5665bc35c1ed917ac8fd06cb651317bb47a65b10 upstream.

The sc and scv 0 system calls have different ABI conventions, and
ptracers need to know which system call type is being used if they want
to look at the syscall registers.

Document that pt_regs.trap can be used for this, and fix one in-tree user
to work with scv 0 syscalls.

Fixes: 7fa95f9adaee ("powerpc/64s: system call support for scv/rfscv instructions")

 scv 0 syscalls will always behave as PPC_FEATURE2_HTM_NOSC.

+------
+When ptracing system calls (PTRACE_SYSCALL), the pt_regs.trap value contains
+the system call type that can be used to distinguish between sc and scv 0
+system calls, and the different register conventions can be accounted for.
+
+If the value of (pt_regs.trap & 0xfff0) is 0xc00 then the system call was
+performed with the sc instruction, if it is 0x3000 then the system call was
+performed with the scv 0 instruction.
