Subject: [PATCH] ipmi: fix SSIF not responding under certain cond.
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.28
Git-commit: 6d2555cde2918409b0331560e66f84a0ad4849c6

commit 6d2555cde2918409b0331560e66f84a0ad4849c6 upstream.

The ipmi communication is not restored after a specific version of BMC is
upgraded on our server.
The ipmi driver does not respond after printing the following log:

    ipmi_ssif: Invalid response getting flags: 1c 1

I found that after entering this branch, ssif_info->ssif_state always
holds SSIF_GETTING_FLAGS and never return to IDLE.

As a result, the driver cannot be loaded, because the driver status is
checked during the unload process and must be IDLE in shutdown_ssif():

        while (ssif_info->ssif_state != SSIF_IDLE)
                schedule_timeout(1);

The process trigger this problem is:

1. One msg timeout and next msg start send, and call
ssif_set_need_watch().

2. ssif_set_need_watch()->watch_timeout()->start_flag_fetch() change
ssif_state to SSIF_GETTING_FLAGS.

3. In msg_done_handler() ssif_state == SSIF_GETTING_FLAGS, if an error
message is received, the second branch does not modify the ssif_state.

4. All retry action need IS_SSIF_IDLE() == True. Include retry action in
watch_timeout(), msg_done_handler(). Sending msg does not work either.
SSIF_IDLE is also checked in start_next_msg().

5. The only thing that can be triggered in the SSIF driver is
watch_timeout(), after destory_user(), this timer will stop too.

So, if enter this branch, the ssif_state will remain SSIF_GETTING_FLAGS
and can't send msg, no timer started, can't unload.

We did a comparative test before and after adding this patch, and the
result is effective.
