Subject: [PATCH] workqueue: Restrict affinity change to rescuer
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.14
Git-commit: 640f17c82460e9724fd256f0a1f5d99e7ff0bda4

[ Upstream commit 640f17c82460e9724fd256f0a1f5d99e7ff0bda4 ]

create_worker() will already set the right affinity using
kthread_bind_mask(), this means only the rescuer will need to change
it's affinity.

Howveer, while in cpu-hot-unplug a regular task is not allowed to run
on online&&!active as it would be pushed away quite agressively. We
need KTHREAD_IS_PER_CPU to survive in that environment.

Therefore set the affinity after getting that magic flag.
