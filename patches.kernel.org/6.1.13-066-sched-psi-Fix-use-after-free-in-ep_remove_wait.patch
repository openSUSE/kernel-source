Subject: [PATCH] sched/psi: Fix use-after-free in ep_remove_wait_queue()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.13
Git-commit: c2dbe32d5db5c4ead121cf86dabd5ab691fb47fe

commit c2dbe32d5db5c4ead121cf86dabd5ab691fb47fe upstream.

If a non-root cgroup gets removed when there is a thread that registered
trigger and is polling on a pressure file within the cgroup, the polling
waitqueue gets freed in the following path:

 do_rmdir
   cgroup_rmdir
     kernfs_drain_open_files
       cgroup_file_release
         cgroup_pressure_release
           psi_trigger_destroy

However, the polling thread still has a reference to the pressure file and
will access the freed waitqueue when the file is closed or upon exit:

 fput
   ep_eventpoll_release
     ep_free
       ep_remove_wait_queue
         remove_wait_queue

This results in use-after-free as pasted below.

The fundamental problem here is that cgroup_file_release() (and
consequently waitqueue's lifetime) is not tied to the file's real lifetime.
Using wake_up_pollfree() here might be less than ideal, but it is in line
with the comment at commit 42288cb44c4b ("wait: add wake_up_pollfree()")
since the waitqueue's lifetime is not tied to file's one and can be
considered as another special case. While this would be fixable by somehow
making cgroup_file_release() be tied to the fput(), it would require
sizable refactoring at cgroups or higher layer which might be more
justifiable if we identify more cases like this.
