[ Upstream commit 6d47b4f08436cb682fb2644e6265a3897fd42a77 ]

A partitioned system configured with only one package and one compute
die, warning will be generated for duplicate sysfs entry. This typically
occurs during the platform bring-up phase.

Partitioned systems expose dies, equivalent to TPMI compute domains,
through the CPUID. Each partitioned system must contains at least one
compute die per partition, resulting in a minimum of two dies per
package. Hence the function topology_max_dies_per_package() returns at
least two, and the condition "topology_max_dies_per_package() > 1"
prevents the creation of a root domain.

In this case topology_max_dies_per_package() will return 1 and root
domain will be created for partition 0 and a duplicate sysfs warning
for partition 1 as both partitions have same package ID.

To address this also check for non zero partition in addition to
topology_max_dies_per_package() > 1.
