Subject: [PATCH] rcu: locking and unlocking need to always be at least
 barriers
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.9
Git-commit: 66be4e66a7f422128748e3c3ef6ee72b20a6197b

commit 66be4e66a7f422128748e3c3ef6ee72b20a6197b upstream.

Herbert Xu pointed out that commit bb73c52bad36 ("rcu: Don't disable
preemption for Tiny and Tree RCU readers") was incorrect in making the
preempt_disable/enable() be conditional on CONFIG_PREEMPT_COUNT.

If CONFIG_PREEMPT_COUNT isn't enabled, the preemption enable/disable is
a no-op, but still is a compiler barrier.

And RCU locking still _needs_ that compiler barrier.

It is simply fundamentally not true that RCU locking would be a complete
no-op: we still need to guarantee (for example) that things that can
trap and cause preemption cannot migrate into the RCU locked region.

The way we do that is by making it a barrier.

See for example commit 386afc91144b ("spinlocks and preemption points
need to be at least compiler barriers") from back in 2013 that had
similar issues with spinlocks that become no-ops on UP: they must still
constrain the compiler from moving other operations into the critical
region.

Now, it is true that a lot of RCU operations already use READ_ONCE() and
WRITE_ONCE() (which in practice likely would never be re-ordered wrt
anything remotely interesting), but it is also true that that is not
globally the case, and that it's not even necessarily always possible
(ie bitfields etc).
