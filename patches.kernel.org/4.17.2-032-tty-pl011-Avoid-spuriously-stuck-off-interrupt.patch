Subject: [PATCH] tty: pl011: Avoid spuriously stuck-off interrupts
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.2
Git-commit: 4a7e625ce50412a7711efa0f2ef0b96ce3826759

commit 4a7e625ce50412a7711efa0f2ef0b96ce3826759 upstream.

Commit 9b96fbacda34 ("serial: PL011: clear pending interrupts")
clears the RX and receive timeout interrupts on pl011 startup, to
avoid a screaming-interrupt scenario that can occur when the
firmware or bootloader leaves these interrupts asserted.

This has been noted as an issue when running Linux on qemu [1].

Unfortunately, the above fix seems to lead to potential
misbehaviour if the RX FIFO interrupt is asserted _non_ spuriously
on driver startup, if the RX FIFO is also already full to the
trigger level.

Clearing the RX FIFO interrupt does not change the FIFO fill level.
In this scenario, because the interrupt is now clear and because
the FIFO is already full to the trigger level, no new assertion of
the RX FIFO interrupt can occur unless the FIFO is drained back
below the trigger level.  This never occurs because the pl011
driver is waiting for an RX FIFO interrupt to tell it that there is
something to read, and does not read the FIFO at all until that
interrupt occurs.

Thus, simply clearing "spurious" interrupts on startup may be
misguided, since there is no way to be sure that the interrupts are
truly spurious, and things can go wrong if they are not.

This patch instead clears the interrupt condition by draining the
RX FIFO during UART startup, after clearing any potentially
spurious interrupt.  This should ensure that an interrupt will
definitely be asserted if the RX FIFO subsequently becomes
sufficiently full.

The drain is done at the point of enabling interrupts only.  This
means that it will occur any time the UART is newly opened through
the tty layer.  It will not apply to polled-mode use of the UART by
kgdboc: since that scenario cannot use interrupts by design, this
should not matter.  kgdboc will interact badly with "normal" use of
the UART in any case: this patch makes no attempt to paper over
such issues.

This patch does not attempt to address the case where the RX FIFO
fills faster than it can be drained: that is a pathological
hardware design problem that is beyond the scope of the driver to
work around.  As a failsafe, the number of poll iterations for
draining the FIFO is limited to twice the FIFO size.  This will
ensure that the kernel at least boots even if it is impossible to
drain the FIFO for some reason.
