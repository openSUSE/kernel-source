Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: meson8b: use the actual frequency for the GPU's
 364MHz OPP
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.4
Git-commit: c3dd3315ab58b2cfa1916df55b0d0f9fbd94266f

commit c3dd3315ab58b2cfa1916df55b0d0f9fbd94266f upstream.

The clock setup on Meson8 cannot achieve a Mali frequency of exactly
182.15MHz. The vendor driver uses "FCLK_DIV7 / 1" for this frequency,
which translates to 2550MHz / 7 / 1 = 364285714Hz.
Update the GPU operating point to that specific frequency to not confuse
myself when comparing the frequency from the .dts with the actual clock
rate on the system.
