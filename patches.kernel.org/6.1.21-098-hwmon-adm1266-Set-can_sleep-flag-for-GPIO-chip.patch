Subject: [PATCH] hwmon: (adm1266) Set `can_sleep` flag for GPIO chip
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.21
Git-commit: a5bb73b3f5db1a4e91402ad132b59b13d2651ed9

[ Upstream commit a5bb73b3f5db1a4e91402ad132b59b13d2651ed9 ]

The adm1266 driver uses I2C bus access in its GPIO chip `set` and `get`
implementation. This means these functions can sleep and the GPIO chip
should set the `can_sleep` property to true.

This will ensure that a warning is printed when trying to set or get the
GPIO value from a context that potentially can't sleep.
