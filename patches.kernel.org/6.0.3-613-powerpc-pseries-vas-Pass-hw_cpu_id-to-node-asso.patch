Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/pseries/vas: Pass hw_cpu_id to node associativity
 HCALL
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.3
Git-commit: f3e5d9e53e74d77e711a2c90a91a8b0836a9e0b3

[ Upstream commit f3e5d9e53e74d77e711a2c90a91a8b0836a9e0b3 ]

Generally the hypervisor decides to allocate a window on different
VAS instances. But if user space wishes to allocate on the current VAS
instance where the process is executing, the kernel has to pass
associativity domain IDs to allocate VAS window HCALL.

To determine the associativity domain IDs for the current CPU,
smp_processor_id() is passed to node associativity HCALL which may
return H_P2 (-55) error during DLPAR CPU event. This is because Linux
CPU numbers (smp_processor_id()) are not the same as the hypervisor's
view of CPU numbers.

Fix the issue by passing hard_smp_processor_id() with
VPHN_FLAG_VCPU flag (PAPR 14.11.6.1 H_HOME_NODE_ASSOCIATIVITY).
