Subject: [PATCH] powerpc: Fix 32-bit KVM-PR lockup and host crash with MacOS
 guest
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.4
Git-commit: fe1ef6bcdb4fca33434256a802a3ed6aacf0bd2f

commit fe1ef6bcdb4fca33434256a802a3ed6aacf0bd2f upstream.

Commit 8792468da5e1 "powerpc: Add the ability to save FPU without
giving it up" unexpectedly removed the MSR_FE0 and MSR_FE1 bits from
the bitmask used to update the MSR of the previous thread in
__giveup_fpu() causing a KVM-PR MacOS guest to lockup and panic the
host kernel.

Leaving FE0/1 enabled means unrelated processes might receive FPEs
when they're not expecting them and crash. In particular if this
happens to init the host will then panic.

eg (transcribed):
  qemu-system-ppc[837]: unhandled signal 8 at 12cc9ce4 nip 12cc9ce4 lr 12cc9ca4 code 0
  systemd[1]: unhandled signal 8 at 202f02e0 nip 202f02e0 lr 001003d4 code 0
  Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init! exitcode=0x0000000b

Reinstate these bits to the MSR bitmask to enable MacOS guests to run
under 32-bit KVM-PR once again without issue.
