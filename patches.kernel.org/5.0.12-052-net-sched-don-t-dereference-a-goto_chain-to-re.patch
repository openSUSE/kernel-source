Subject: [PATCH] net/sched: don't dereference a->goto_chain to read the chain
 index
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.12
Git-commit: fe384e2fa36ca084a456fd30558cccc75b4b3fbd

[ Upstream commit fe384e2fa36ca084a456fd30558cccc75b4b3fbd ]

callers of tcf_gact_goto_chain_index() can potentially read an old value
of the chain index, or even dereference a NULL 'goto_chain' pointer,
because 'goto_chain' and 'tcfa_action' are read in the traffic path
without caring of concurrent write in the control path. The most recent
value of chain index can be read also from a->tcfa_action (it's encoded
there together with TC_ACT_GOTO_CHAIN bits), so we don't really need to
dereference 'goto_chain': just read the chain id from the control action.

Fixes: e457d86ada27 ("net: sched: add couple of goto_chain helpers")
