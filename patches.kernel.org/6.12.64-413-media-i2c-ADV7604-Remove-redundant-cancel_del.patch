Subject: [PATCH] media: i2c: ADV7604: Remove redundant cancel_delayed_work in
 probe
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.64
Git-commit: 8f34f24355a607b98ecd9924837aab13c676eeca

commit 8f34f24355a607b98ecd9924837aab13c676eeca upstream.

The delayed_work delayed_work_enable_hotplug is initialized with
INIT_DELAYED_WORK() in adv76xx_probe(), but it is never scheduled
anywhere in the probe function.

Calling cancel_delayed_work() on a work that has never been
scheduled is redundant and unnecessary, as there is no pending
work to cancel.

Remove the redundant cancel_delayed_work() from error handling
path and adjust the goto label accordingly to simplify the code
and avoid potential confusion.
