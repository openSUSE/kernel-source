Subject: [PATCH] ARM: OMAP1: ams-delta: Fix audio permanently muted
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.8
Git-commit: 2afdb4c41d7876e430b9bc6e2d7e2fe28609fd6a

[ Upstream commit 2afdb4c41d7876e430b9bc6e2d7e2fe28609fd6a ]

Since commit 1137ceee76ba ("ARM: OMAP1: ams-delta: Don't request unused
GPIOs"), on-board audio has appeared muted.  Believed to be unused GPIO
pin "hookflash1", apparently set high regardless of the corresponding
bit of "latch2" port attempted to be set low during .init_machine(),
has been identified as the reason.

According to Amstrad E3 wiki, the purpose of the pin hasn't been
clearly identified.  Original Amstrad software used to produce a high
pulse on it when the phone was taken off hook or recall was pressed.
With the current finding, we can assume the pin provides a kind of
audio mute function.

Proper resolution of the issue should be done in two steps:
- resolution of an issue with the pin state not reflecting the value
  the corresponding bit of the port was attempted to be initialized
  with,
- extension of on-board audio driver with a new control.

For now, rename the pin to "audio_mute" to reflect its function and,
as a quick fix, hogg it as output low so on-board audio can produce
audible sound again.
