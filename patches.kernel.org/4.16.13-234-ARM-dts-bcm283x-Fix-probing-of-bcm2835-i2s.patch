Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: bcm283x: Fix probing of bcm2835-i2s
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.13
Git-commit: 79c81facdc0b43b1cef37b8d5689a8c8b78f8be0

[ Upstream commit 79c81facdc0b43b1cef37b8d5689a8c8b78f8be0 ]

Since 517e7a1537a ("ASoC: bcm2835: move to use the clock framework")
the bcm2835-i2s requires a clock as DT property. Unfortunately
the necessary DT change has never been applied. While we are at it
also fix the first PCM register range to cover the PCM_GRAY register.

Fixes: 517e7a1537a ("ASoC: bcm2835: move to use the clock framework")
