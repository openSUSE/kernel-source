Subject: [PATCH] bus: mhi: host: Skip MHI reset if device is in RDDM
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.54
Git-commit: cabce92dd805945a090dc6fc73b001bb35ed083a

commit cabce92dd805945a090dc6fc73b001bb35ed083a upstream.

In RDDM EE, device can not process MHI reset issued by host. In case of MHI
power off, host is issuing MHI reset and polls for it to get cleared until
it times out. Since this timeout can not be avoided in case of RDDM, skip
the MHI reset in this scenarios.
