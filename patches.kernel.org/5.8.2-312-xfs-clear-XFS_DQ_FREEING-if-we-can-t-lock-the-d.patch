Subject: [PATCH] xfs: clear XFS_DQ_FREEING if we can't lock the dquot buffer
 to flush
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.8.2
Git-commit: c97738a960a86081a147e7d436138e6481757445

[ Upstream commit c97738a960a86081a147e7d436138e6481757445 ]

In commit 8d3d7e2b35ea, we changed xfs_qm_dqpurge to bail out if we
can't lock the dquot buf to flush the dquot.  This prevents the AIL from
blocking on the dquot, but it also forgets to clear the FREEING flag on
its way out.  A subsequent purge attempt will see the FREEING flag is
set and bail out, which leads to dqpurge_all failing to purge all the
dquots.

(copy-pasting from Dave Chinner's identical patch)

This was found by inspection after having xfs/305 hang 1 in ~50
iterations in a quotaoff operation:

Returning -EAGAIN from xfs_qm_dqpurge() without clearing the
XFS_DQ_FREEING flag means the xfs_qm_dqpurge_all() code can never
free the dquot, and we loop forever waiting for the XFS_DQ_FREEING
flag to go away on the dquot that leaked it via -EAGAIN.
