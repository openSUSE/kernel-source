Subject: [PATCH] vmbus: fix subchannel removal
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.6
Git-commit: b5679cebf780c6f1c2451a73bf1842a4409840e7

[ Upstream commit b5679cebf780c6f1c2451a73bf1842a4409840e7 ]

The changes to split ring allocation from open/close, broke
the cleanup of subchannels. This resulted in problems using
uio on network devices because the subchannel was left behind
when the network device was unbound.

The cause was in the disconnect logic which used list splice
to move the subchannel list into a local variable. This won't
work because the subchannel list is needed later during the
process of the rescind messages (relid2channel).

The fix is to just leave the subchannel list in place
which is what the original code did. The list is cleaned
up later when the host rescind is processed.

Without the fix, we have a lot of "hang" issues in netvsc when we
try to change the NIC's MTU, set the number of channels, etc.
