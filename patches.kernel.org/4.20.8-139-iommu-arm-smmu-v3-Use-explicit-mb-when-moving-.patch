Subject: [PATCH] iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Use explicit mb() when moving cons pointer
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.8
Git-commit: a868e8530441286342f90c1fd9c5f24de3aa2880

[ Upstream commit a868e8530441286342f90c1fd9c5f24de3aa2880 ]

After removing an entry from a queue (e.g. reading an event in
arm_smmu_evtq_thread()) it is necessary to advance the MMIO consumer
pointer to free the queue slot back to the SMMU. A memory barrier is
required here so that all reads targetting the queue entry have
completed before the consumer pointer is updated.

The implementation of queue_inc_cons() relies on a writel() to complete
the previous reads, but this is incorrect because writel() is only
guaranteed to complete prior writes. This patch replaces the call to
writel() with an mb(); writel_relaxed() sequence, which gives us the
read->write ordering which we require.
