Subject: [PATCH] thunderbolt: Change downstream router's TMU rate in both TMU
 uni/bidir mode
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.4
Git-commit: 5fd6b9a5cbe63fea4c490fee8af34144a139a266

[ Upstream commit 5fd6b9a5cbe63fea4c490fee8af34144a139a266 ]

In case of uni-directional time sync, TMU handshake is
initiated by upstream router. In case of bi-directional
time sync, TMU handshake is initiated by downstream router.
In order to handle correctly the case of uni-directional mode,
we avoid changing the upstream router's rate to off,
because it might have another downstream router plugged that is set to
uni-directional mode (and we don't want to change its mode).
Instead, we always change downstream router's rate.
