Subject: [PATCH] pwm: rockchip: rockchip_pwm_probe(): Remove superfluous
 clk_unprepare()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.11.3
Git-commit: d5d8d675865ccddfe4da26c85f22c55cec663bf2

[ Upstream commit d5d8d675865ccddfe4da26c85f22c55cec663bf2 ]

If rockchip_pwm_probe() fails to register a PWM device it calls
clk_unprepare() for the device's PWM clock, without having first disabled
the clock and before jumping to an error handler that also unprepares
it. This is likely to produce warnings from the kernel about the clock
being unprepared when it is still enabled, and then being unprepared when
it has already been unprepared.

Prevent these warnings by removing this unnecessary call to
clk_unprepare().
