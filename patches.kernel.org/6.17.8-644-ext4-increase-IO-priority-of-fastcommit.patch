Subject: [PATCH] ext4: increase IO priority of fastcommit
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.8
Git-commit: 46e75c56dfeafb6756773b71cabe187a6886859a

[ Upstream commit 46e75c56dfeafb6756773b71cabe187a6886859a ]

The following code paths may result in high latency or even task hangs:
   1. fastcommit io is throttled by wbt.
   2. jbd2_fc_wait_bufs() might wait for a long time while
JBD2_FAST_COMMIT_ONGOING is set in journal->flags, and then
jbd2_journal_commit_transaction() waits for the
JBD2_FAST_COMMIT_ONGOING bit for a long time while holding the write
lock of j_state_lock.
   3. start_this_handle() waits for read lock of j_state_lock which
results in high latency or task hang.

Given the fact that ext4_fc_commit() already modifies the current
process' IO priority to match that of the jbd2 thread, it should be
reasonable to match jbd2's IO submission flags as well.
