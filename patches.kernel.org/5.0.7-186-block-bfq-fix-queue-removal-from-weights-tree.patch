Subject: [PATCH] block, bfq: fix queue removal from weights tree
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.7
Git-commit: 9dee8b3b057e1da26f85f1842f2aaf3bb200fb94

[ Upstream commit 9dee8b3b057e1da26f85f1842f2aaf3bb200fb94 ]

bfq maintains an ordered list, through a red-black tree, of unique
weights of active bfq_queues. This list is used to detect whether there
are active queues with differentiated weights. The weight of a queue is
removed from the list when both the following two conditions become
true:

(1) the bfq_queue is flagged as inactive
(2) the has no in-flight request any longer;

Unfortunately, in the rare cases where condition (2) becomes true before
condition (1), the removal fails, because the function to remove the
weight of the queue (bfq_weights_tree_remove) is rightly invoked in the
path that deactivates the bfq_queue, but mistakenly invoked *before* the
function that actually performs the deactivation (bfq_deactivate_bfqq).

This commits moves the invocation of bfq_weights_tree_remove for
condition (1) to after bfq_deactivate_bfqq. As a consequence of this
move, it is necessary to add a further reference to the queue when the
weight of a queue is added, because the queue might otherwise be freed
before bfq_weights_tree_remove is invoked. This commit adds this
reference and makes all related modifications.
