Subject: [PATCH] selftests/bpf: Improve reliability of
 test_perf_branches_no_hw()
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.63
Git-commit: ae24fc8a16b0481ea8c5acbc66453c49ec0431c4

[ Upstream commit ae24fc8a16b0481ea8c5acbc66453c49ec0431c4 ]

Currently, test_perf_branches_no_hw() relies on the busy loop within
test_perf_branches_common() being slow enough to allow at least one
perf event sample tick to occur before starting to tear down the
backing perf event BPF program. With a relatively small fixed
iteration count of 1,000,000, this is not guaranteed on modern fast
CPUs, resulting in the test run to subsequently fail with the
following:

bpf_testmod.ko is already unloaded.

Summary: 0/1 PASSED, 0 SKIPPED, 1 FAILED
Successfully unloaded bpf_testmod.ko.

On a modern CPU (i.e. one with a 3.5 GHz clock rate), executing 1
million increments of a volatile integer can take significantly less
than 1 millisecond. If the spin loop and detachment of the perf event
BPF program elapses before the first 1 ms sampling interval elapses,
the perf event will never end up firing. Fix this by bumping the loop
iteration counter a little within test_perf_branches_common(), along
with ensuring adding another loop termination condition which is
directly influenced by the backing perf event BPF program
executing. Notably, a concious decision was made to not adjust the
sample_freq value as that is just not a reliable way to go about
fixing the problem. It effectively still leaves the race window open.
