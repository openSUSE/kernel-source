Subject: [PATCH] Revert "block: simplify set_init_blocksize" to regain lost
 performance
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.13
Git-commit: 8dc932d3e8afb65e12eba7495f046c83884c49bf

commit 8dc932d3e8afb65e12eba7495f046c83884c49bf upstream.

The cited commit introduced a serious regression with SATA write speed,
as found by bisecting. This patch reverts this commit, which restores
write speed back to the values observed before this commit.

The performance tests were done on a Helios4 NAS (2nd batch) with 4 HDDs
(WD8003FFBX) using dd (bs=1M count=2000). "Direct" is a test with a
single HDD, the rest are different RAID levels built over the first
partitions of 4 HDDs. Test results are in MB/s, R is read, W is write.

                | Direct | RAID0 | RAID10 f2 | RAID10 n2 | RAID6
----------------+--------+-------+-----------+-----------+--------

Applying this patch doesn't hurt read performance, while improves the
write speed by 1.5x - 3.5x (more impact on RAID tests). The write speed
is restored back to the state before the faulty commit, and even a bit
higher in RAID tests (which aren't HDD-bound on this device) - that is
likely related to other optimizations done between the faulty commit and
5.10.10 which also improved the read speed.
