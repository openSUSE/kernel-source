Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: Free vCPUs before freeing VM state
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.41
Git-commit: 17bcd714426386fda741a4bccd96a2870179344b

commit 17bcd714426386fda741a4bccd96a2870179344b upstream.

Free vCPUs before freeing any VM state, as both SVM and VMX may access
VM state when "freeing" a vCPU that is currently "in" L2, i.e. that needs
to be kicked out of nested guest mode.

Commit 6fcee03df6a1 ("KVM: x86: avoid loading a vCPU after .vm_destroy was
called") partially fixed the issue, but for unknown reasons only moved the
MMU unloading before VM destruction.  Complete the change, and free all
vCPU state prior to destroying VM state, as nVMX accesses even more state
than nSVM.

In addition to the AVIC, KVM can hit a use-after-free on MSR filters:

  kvm_arch_destroy_vm+0x12c/0x1c0
  kvm_put_kvm+0x263/0x3c0
  kvm_vm_release+0x21/0x30

and an upcoming fix to process injectable interrupts on nested VM-Exit
will access the PIC:

  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000090
  #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode

   kvm_destroy_vm+0x172/0x300 [kvm]
   kvm_vcpu_release+0x31/0x50 [kvm]

Inarguably, both nSVM and nVMX need to be fixed, but punt on those
cleanups for the moment.  Conceptually, vCPUs should be freed before VM
state.  Assets like the I/O APIC and PIC _must_ be allocated before vCPUs
are created, so it stands to reason that they must be freed _after_ vCPUs
are destroyed.
