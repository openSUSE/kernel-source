Subject: [PATCH] splice: only read in as much information as there is pipe
 buffer space
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

commit 3253d9d093376d62b4a56e609f15d2ec5085ac73 upstream.

Andreas Grünbacher reports that on the two filesystems that support
iomap directio, it's possible for splice() to return -EAGAIN (instead of
a short splice) if the pipe being written to has less space available in
its pipe buffers than the length supplied by the calling process.

Months ago we fixed splice_direct_to_actor to clamp the length of the
read request to the size of the splice pipe.  Do the same to do_splice.

Fixes: 17614445576b6 ("splice: don't read more than available pipe space")
