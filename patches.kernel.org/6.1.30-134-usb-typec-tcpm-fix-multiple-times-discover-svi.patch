Subject: [PATCH] usb: typec: tcpm: fix multiple times discover svids error
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.30
Git-commit: dac3b192107b978198e89ec0f77375738352e0c8

[ Upstream commit dac3b192107b978198e89ec0f77375738352e0c8 ]

PD3.0 Spec 6.4.4.3.2 say that only Responder supports 12 or more SVIDs,
the Discover SVIDs Command Shall be executed multiple times until a
Discover SVIDs VDO is returned ending either with a SVID value of
0x0000 in the last part of the last VDO or with a VDO containing two
SVIDs with values of 0x0000.

In the current implementation, if the last VDO does not find that the
Discover SVIDs Command would be executed multiple times even if the
Responder SVIDs are less than 12, and we found some odd dockers just
meet this case. So fix it.
