Subject: [PATCH] tcp: fix dctcp delayed ACK schedule
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.11
Git-commit: b0c05d0e99d98d7f0cd41efc1eeec94efdc3325d

[ Upstream commit b0c05d0e99d98d7f0cd41efc1eeec94efdc3325d ]

Previously, when a data segment was sent an ACK was piggybacked
on the data segment without generating a CA_EVENT_NON_DELAYED_ACK
event to notify congestion control modules. So the DCTCP
ca->delayed_ack_reserved flag could incorrectly stay set when
in fact there were no delayed ACKs being reserved. This could result
in sending a special ECN notification ACK that carries an older
ACK sequence, when in fact there was no need for such an ACK.
DCTCP keeps track of the delayed ACK status with its own separate
state ca->delayed_ack_reserved. Previously it may accidentally cancel
the delayed ACK without updating this field upon sending a special
ACK that carries a older ACK sequence. This inconsistency would
lead to DCTCP receiver never acknowledging the latest data until the
sender times out and retry in some cases.
