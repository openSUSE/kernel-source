Subject: [PATCH] usb: uas: add support for more quirk flags
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.10
Git-commit: 42d1c6d4a06a77b3ab206a919b9050c3080f3a71

commit 42d1c6d4a06a77b3ab206a919b9050c3080f3a71 upstream.

The hope that UAS devices would be less broken than old style storage
devices has turned out to be unfounded. Make UAS support more of the
quirk flags of the old driver.
