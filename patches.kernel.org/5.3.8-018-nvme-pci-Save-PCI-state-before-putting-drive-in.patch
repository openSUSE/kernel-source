Subject: [PATCH] nvme-pci: Save PCI state before putting drive into deepest
 state
References: bnc#1151927
Patch-mainline: 5.3.8
Git-commit: 7cbb5c6f9aa7cfda7175d82a9cf77a92965b0c5e

[ Upstream commit 7cbb5c6f9aa7cfda7175d82a9cf77a92965b0c5e ]

The action of saving the PCI state will cause numerous PCI configuration
space reads which depending upon the vendor implementation may cause
the drive to exit the deepest NVMe state.

In these cases ASPM will typically resolve the PCIe link state and APST
may resolve the NVMe power state.  However it has also been observed
that this register access after quiesced will cause PC10 failure
on some device combinations.

To resolve this, move the PCI state saving to before SetFeatures has been
called.  This has been proven to resolve the issue across a 5000 sample
test on previously failing disk/system combinations.
