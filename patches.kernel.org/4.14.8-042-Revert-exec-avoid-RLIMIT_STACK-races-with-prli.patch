Subject: [PATCH] Revert "exec: avoid RLIMIT_STACK races with prlimit()"

commit 779f4e1c6c7c661db40dfebd6dd6bda7b5f88aa3 upstream.

This reverts commit 04e35f4495dd560db30c25efca4eecae8ec8c375.

SELinux runs with secureexec for all non-"noatsecure" domain transitions,
which means lots of processes end up hitting the stack hard-limit change
that was introduced in order to fix a race with prlimit(). That race fix
will need to be redesigned.
