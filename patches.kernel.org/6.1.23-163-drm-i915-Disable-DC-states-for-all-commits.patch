Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: Disable DC states for all commits

commit a2b6e99d8a623544f3bdccd28ee35b9c1b00daa5 upstream.

Keeping DC states enabled is incompatible with the _noarm()/_arm()
split we use for writing pipe/plane registers. When DC5 and PSR
are enabled, all pipe/plane registers effectively become self-arming
on account of DC5 exit arming the update, and PSR exit latching it.

What probably saves us most of the time is that (with PIPE_MISC[21]=0)
all pipe register writes themselves trigger PSR exit, and then
we don't re-enter PSR until the idle frame count has elapsed.
So it may be that the PSR exit happens already before we've
updated the state too much.

Also the PSR1 panel (at least on this KBL) seems to discard the first
frame we trasmit, presumably still scanning out from its internal
framebuffer at that point. So only the second frame we transmit is
actually visible. But I suppose that could also be panel specific
behaviour. I haven't checked out how other PSR panels behave, nor
did I bother to check what the eDP spec has to say about this.

And since this really is all about DC states, let's switch from
the MODESET domain to the DC_OFF domain. Functionally they are
100% identical. We should probably remove the MODESET domain...

And for good measure let's toss in an assert to the place where
we do the _noarm() register writes to make sure DC states are
in fact off.

v2: Just use intel_display_power_is_enabled() (Imre)
