Subject: [PATCH] bcache: quit dc->writeback_thread when BCACHE_DEV_DETACHING
 is set

[ Upstream commit fadd94e05c02afec7b70b0b14915624f1782f578 ]

In patch "bcache: fix cached_dev->count usage for bch_cache_set_error()",
cached_dev_get() is called when creating dc->writeback_thread, and
cached_dev_put() is called when exiting dc->writeback_thread. This
modification works well unless people detach the bcache device manually by
    'echo 1 > /sys/block/bcache<N>/bcache/detach'
Because this sysfs interface only calls bch_cached_dev_detach() which wakes
up dc->writeback_thread but does not stop it. The reason is, before patch
"bcache: fix cached_dev->count usage for bch_cache_set_error()", inside
bch_writeback_thread(), if cache is not dirty after writeback,
cached_dev_put() will be called here. And in cached_dev_make_request() when
a new write request makes cache from clean to dirty, cached_dev_get() will
be called there. Since we don't operate dc->count in these locations,
refcount d->count cannot be dropped after cache becomes clean, and
cached_dev_detach_finish() won't be called to detach bcache device.

This patch fixes the issue by checking whether BCACHE_DEV_DETACHING is
set inside bch_writeback_thread(). If this bit is set and cache is clean
(no existing writeback_keys), break the while-loop, call cached_dev_put()
and quit the writeback thread.

Please note if cache is still dirty, even BCACHE_DEV_DETACHING is set the
writeback thread should continue to perform writeback, this is the original
design of manually detach.

It is safe to do the following check without locking, let me explain why,
+	if (!test_bit(BCACHE_DEV_DETACHING, &dc->disk.flags) &&
+	    (!atomic_read(&dc->has_dirty) || !dc->writeback_running)) {

If the kenrel thread does not sleep and continue to run due to conditions
are not updated in time on the running CPU core, it just consumes more CPU
cycles and has no hurt. This should-sleep-but-run is safe here. We just
focus on the should-run-but-sleep condition, which means the writeback
thread goes to sleep in mistake while it should continue to run.
1, First of all, no matter the writeback thread is hung or not,
   kthread_stop() from cached_dev_detach_finish() will wake up it and
   terminate by making kthread_should_stop() return true. And in normal
   run time, bit on index BCACHE_DEV_DETACHING is always cleared, the
   condition
	!test_bit(BCACHE_DEV_DETACHING, &dc->disk.flags)
   is always true and can be ignored as constant value.
2, If one of the following conditions is true, the writeback thread should
   go to sleep,
   "!atomic_read(&dc->has_dirty)" or "!dc->writeback_running)"
   each of them independently controls the writeback thread should sleep or
   not, let's analyse them one by one.
2.1 condition "!atomic_read(&dc->has_dirty)"
   If dc->has_dirty is set from 0 to 1 on another CPU core, bcache will
   call bch_writeback_queue() immediately or call bch_writeback_add() which
   indirectly calls bch_writeback_queue() too. In bch_writeback_queue(),
   wake_up_process(dc->writeback_thread) is called. It sets writeback
   thread's task state to TASK_RUNNING and following an implicit memory
   barrier, then tries to wake up the writeback thread.
   In writeback thread, its task state is set to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE before
   doing the condition check. If other CPU core sets the TASK_RUNNING state
   after writeback thread setting TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, the writeback thread
   will be scheduled to run very soon because its state is not
   TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE. If other CPU core sets the TASK_RUNNING state before
   writeback thread setting TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, the implict memory barrier
   of wake_up_process() will make sure modification of dc->has_dirty on
   other CPU core is updated and observed on the CPU core of writeback
   thread. Therefore the condition check will correctly be false, and
   continue writeback code without sleeping.
2.2 condition "!dc->writeback_running)"
   dc->writeback_running can be changed via sysfs file, every time it is
   modified, a following bch_writeback_queue() is alwasy called. So the
   change is always observed on the CPU core of writeback thread. If
   dc->writeback_running is changed from 0 to 1 on other CPU core, this
   condition check will observe the modification and allow writeback
   thread to continue to run without sleeping.
Now we can see, even without a locking protection, multiple conditions
check is safe here, no deadlock or process hang up will happen.

I compose a separte patch because that patch "bcache: fix cached_dev->count
usage for bch_cache_set_error()" already gets a "Reviewed-by:" from Hannes
Reinecke. Also this fix is not trivial and good for a separate patch.
