Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/realtek - Set default power save node to 0
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.8
Git-commit: 317d9313925cd8388304286c0d3c8dda7f060a2d

commit 317d9313925cd8388304286c0d3c8dda7f060a2d upstream.

I measured power consumption between power_save_node=1 and power_save_node=0.
It's almost the same.
Codec will enter to runtime suspend and suspend.
That pin also will enter to D3. Don't need to enter to D3 by single pin.
So, Disable power_save_node as default. It will avoid more issues.
Windows Driver also has not this option at runtime PM.
