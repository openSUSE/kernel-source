Subject: [PATCH] io_uring: hold uring_lock while completing failed polled io
 in io_wq_submit_work()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.10.4
Git-commit: c07e6719511e77c4b289f62bfe96423eb6ea061d

commit c07e6719511e77c4b289f62bfe96423eb6ea061d upstream.

io_iopoll_complete() does not hold completion_lock to complete polled io,
so in io_wq_submit_work(), we can not call io_req_complete() directly, to
complete polled io, otherwise there maybe concurrent access to cqring,
defer_list, etc, which is not safe. Commit dad1b1242fd5 ("io_uring: always
let io_iopoll_complete() complete polled io") has fixed this issue, but
Pavel reported that IOPOLL apart from rw can do buf reg/unreg requests(
IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS or IORING_OP_REMOVE_BUFFERS), so the fix is not
good.

Given that io_iopoll_complete() is always called under uring_lock, so here
for polled io, we can also get uring_lock to fix this issue.
