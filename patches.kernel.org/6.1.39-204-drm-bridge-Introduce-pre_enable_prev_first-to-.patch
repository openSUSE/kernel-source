Subject: [PATCH] drm/bridge: Introduce pre_enable_prev_first to alter bridge
 init order
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.39
Git-commit: 4fb912e5e19075874379cfcf074d90bd51ebf8ea

[ Upstream commit 4fb912e5e19075874379cfcf074d90bd51ebf8ea ]

DSI sink devices typically want the DSI host powered up and configured
before they are powered up. pre_enable is the place this would normally
happen, but they are called in reverse order from panel/connector towards
the encoder, which is the "wrong" order.

Add a new flag pre_enable_prev_first that any bridge can set
to swap the order of pre_enable (and post_disable) for that and the
immediately previous bridge.
Should the immediately previous bridge also set the
pre_enable_prev_first flag, the previous bridge to that will be called
before either of those which requested pre_enable_prev_first.

eg:
- Panel
- Bridge 1
- Bridge 2 pre_enable_prev_first
- Bridge 3
- Bridge 4 pre_enable_prev_first
- Bridge 5 pre_enable_prev_first
- Bridge 6
- Encoder
Would result in pre_enable's being called as Panel, Bridge 1, Bridge 3,
Bridge 2, Bridge 6, Bridge 5, Bridge 4, Encoder.
