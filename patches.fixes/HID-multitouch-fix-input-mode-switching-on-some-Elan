This bug reports mentions 6d4f5440 ("HID: multitouch: Fetch feature
reports on demand for Win8 devices") as the origin of the problem but this
commit actually masked 2 firmware bugs that are annihilating each other:

The report descriptor declares two features in reports 3 and 5:

0x05, 0x0d,                    // Usage Page (Digitizers)             318

0x85, 0x05,                    //   Report ID (5)                     347

0x95, 0x0e,                    //   Report Count (14)                 363
0xb1, 0x03,                    //   Feature (Cnst,Var,Abs)            365

The report ID 3 presents 2 input mode features, while only the first one
is handled by the device. Given that we did not checked if one was
previously assigned, we were dealing with the ignored featured and we
should never have been able to switch this panel into the multitouch mode.

However, the firmware presents an other bugs which allowed 6d4f5440
to counteract the faulty report descriptor. When we request the values
of the feature 5, the firmware answers "03 03 00". The fields are correct
but the report id is wrong. Before 6d4f5440, we retrieved all the features
and injected them in the system. So when we called report 5, we injected
in the system the report 3 with the values "03 00".
Setting the second input mode to 03 in this report changed it to "03 03"
and the touchpad switched to the mt mode. We could have set anything
in the second field because the actual value (the first 03 in this report)
was given by the query of report ID 5.

To sum up: 2 bugs in the firmware were hiding that we were accessing the
wrong feature.
