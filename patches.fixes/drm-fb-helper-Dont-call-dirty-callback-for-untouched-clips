Subject: [PATCH v2] drm/fb-helper: Don't call dirty callback for untouched clips
Date: Thu, 20 Oct 2016 17:05:30 +0200
Message-id: <20161020150530.5787-1-tiwai@suse.de>
Patch-mainline: Submitted, dri-devel ML
References: boo#1003298

Since 4.7 kernel, we've seen the error messages like

 kernel: [TTM] Buffer eviction failed
 kernel: qxl 0000:00:02.0: object_init failed for (4026540032, 0x00000001)
 kernel: [drm:qxl_alloc_bo_reserved [qxl]] *ERROR* failed to allocate VRAM BO

on QXL when switching and accessing on VT.  The culprit was the
generic deferred_io code (qxl driver switched to it since 4.7).
There is a race between the dirty clip update and the call of
callback.

In drm_fb_helper_dirty(), the dirty clip is updated in the spinlock,
while it kicks off the update worker outside the spinlock.  Meanwhile
the update worker clears the dirty clip in the spinlock, too.  Thus,
when drm_fb_helper_dirty() is called concurrently, schedule_work() is
called after the clip is cleared in the first worker call.

This patch addresses it by validating the clip before calling the
dirty fb callback.
