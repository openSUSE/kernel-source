Subject: btrfs: qgroup: fix quota disable during rescan
Patch-mainline: Submitted, https://www.marc.info/?l=linux-btrfs&m=144683502126223&w=2 (review: fix is good but needs a better commit message)

There's a race condition that leads to a NULL pointer dereference if you
disable quotas while a quota rescan is running.  To fix this, we just need
to wait for the quota rescan worker to actually exit before tearing down
the quota structures.
