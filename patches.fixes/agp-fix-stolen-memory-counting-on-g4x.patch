Subject: agp: Fix stolen memory counting on G4X.
Patch-mainline: 2.6.28
References: bnc#437618

From: Eric Anholt <eric@anholt.net>

commit 82e14a6215cbc9804ecc35281e973c6c8ce22fe7 upstream

On the GM45, the amount of stolen memory mapped to the GTT was underestimated,
even though we had 508KB more available since the GTT doesn't take from
stolen memory. On the non-GM45 G4X, we overestimated how much stolen was
mapped to the GTT by 4KB, resulting in GPU page faults when that page was
accessed.

This update requires a corresponding update to xf86-video-intel to work
correctly.
