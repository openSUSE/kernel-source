Subject: [PATCH] wext: fix potential private ioctl memory content leak
Patch-mainline: Submitted Sep 16, 2010
References: CVE-2010-2955 bnc#635413
Introduced-by: Prior to 2.6.5

When a driver doesn't fill the entire buffer, old
heap contents may remain, and if it also doesn't
update the length properly, this old heap content
will be copied back to userspace.

It is very unlikely that this happens in any of
the drivers using private ioctls since it would
show up as junk being reported by iwpriv, but it
seems better to be safe here, so use kzalloc.
