   [SPARC32]: Fix syntax errors from smp_{mb,rmb,wmb} on sparc32.
   
   smp_mb(), smp_rmp() and smp_wmb() definitions have a trailing semicolon 
   and cause compilation errors in single statement context, like 
   if-then-else on line 358 in include/linux/skbuff.h. This patch removes 
   all three offending semicolons to make it compile.

   [PATCH] nls_cp936.c is not synchronized with M$'s translation table
   
   The nls_cp936.c is not synchronized with MS's translation table, there are
   some characters have different code from the code in updated table of MS.
   For example, the unicode for character 0xB8A3 (GBK) should be U+798F, but
   the code is U+FA1B in nls_cp936.c.
   
   Regenerated the tables.  The number of differences is rather large, so I
   did not check every change, but looking at a random sample the changes seem
   OK.  Mostly the CJK Compatibility Ideographs have been replaced by their
   ordinary equivalents.  Some code points that were unassigned now got a
   meaning.

   Richard Purdie provided a patch to fix support for XScale1 processors (this
   is the PMU version i never had access to initially), we weren't clearing
   the overflow flags after an overflow interrupt had triggered resulting in
   no additional interrupts occuring.  Additionally i've added basic power

   [PATCH] Force read implies exec for all 32bit processes in x86-64
   
   This effectively enables executable stack and executable heap for all 32bit
   programs on x86-64, except if noexec32=on is specified.
   
   This does not support changing this with personality right now, this would
   need more intrusive changes.  A 64bit process will always turn it off and a
   32bit process turn it on.  
   
   Also readd the noexec32=on option to turn this off and fix a minor bug in
   noexec=...  (would be reported as unknown option)

   [PATCH] binfmt_elf: clearing bss may fail
   
   So we discover that Borland's Kylix application builder emits weird elf
   files which describe a non-writeable bss segment.
   
   So remove the clear_user() check at the place where we zero out the bss.  I
   don't _think_ there are any security implications here (plus we've never
   checked that clear_user() return value, so whoops if it is a problem).

   [PATCH] Fix shmget for ppc64, s390-64 & sparc64.
   
   The second parameter of the sys_ipc system wrapper on ppc64, s390-64 and
   sparc64 is an "int".  sys_shmget gets called with this 32 bit value as the
   size parameter.  This limits the maximum shared memory segment on these
   three architectures to 2GB.  To fix this the second parameter is declared
   as an "unsigned long" and is then casted to the type required by the The
   same int vs.  unsigned long bug is fixed for sys_msgsnd and sys_msgrcv as
   well.

   [PATCH] Fix compat shmget overflow
   
   This fixes an incorrect sign extension in the compat layer that breaks
   32bit shmget that are >2GB.  sys_shmget has a signed size_t size argument,
   and the int size argument coming from 32bit user space would get sign
   extended to 64bit, which is wrong.
   
   I fixed it on all compat architectures, except PPC64 which was already ok. 
   
   It was originally debugged and fixed by Karl Rister @ IBM for SLES9 on x86-64.

   [PATCH] L18 flash corruption fix
   
   Another fix to the put_chip() concurrency logic.
   
   Problem was occurring when:
   
   1) one thread was erasing a block in partition x;
   2) another thread suspended the erase in order to write to
      partition y;
   3) a third thread came along to read a different block from
      partition x and, when it called put_chip(), chip->oldstate was
      FL_ERASING and the erase (mistakenly) resumed;
   4) the write in partition y obviously failed at that point.
   
   Incidentally, the fix for this problem also fixed the case where
   suspending writes for MTD XIP usage was not working properly.

   [PATCH] sonypi: add fan and temperature status/control
   
   1. FAN Status/Control: you can now get the fan status (running or not) and
      also set the fan speed (for <5 seconds only). The problem is that there
      is an auto regulator that kicks in within about 5 seconds after that to
      restart the fan if it is above a threshold temperature (39 Degree C in
      my Vaio). It is useful just to get the fan status (primarily). It also
      appears that you can change the speed by increasing the values (much
      like the LCD control) - there are effectively only about 6 speeds (it
      seems - not sure, but from what I've played with on my Vaio).
   
   2. Temperature: you can get the current temperature (same as reported by
      ACPI). This is primarily useful for APM users (since ACPI already gives
      this). I have used this to detect when the fan comes on in my Vaio (39
      Degree C).

+	These are, perhaps, slightly confusing names.
+	The terms device and class_device have well defined meanings in the
