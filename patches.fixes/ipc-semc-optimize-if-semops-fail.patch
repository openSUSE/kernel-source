Patch-upstream: should be 2.6.33
Subject: ipc: sem optimize if semops fail

Reduce the amount of scanning of the list of pending semaphore operations:
If try_atomic_semop failed, then no changes were applied.  Thus no need to
restart.

Additionally, this patch correct an incorrect comment: It's possible to
wait for arbitrary semaphore values (do a dec by <x>, wait-for-zero, inc
by <x> in one atomic operation)

Both changes are from Nick Piggin, the patch is the result of a different
split of the individual changes.
