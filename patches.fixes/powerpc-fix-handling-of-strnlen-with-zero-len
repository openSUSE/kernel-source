Subject: [PATCH] powerpc: fix handling of strnlen with zero len
Patch-mainline: submitted 17 Mar 2010
References: bnc#582681

 Commit 0119536c, which added the assembly version of strncmp to
 powerpc, mentions that it adds two instructions to the version from
 boot/string.S to allow it to handle len=0. Unfortunately, it doesn't
 always return 0 when that is the case. The length is passed in r5, but
 the return value is passed back in r3. In certain cases, this will
 happen to work. Otherwise it will pass back the address of the first
 string as the return value.

 This patch lifts the len <= 0 handling code from memcpy to handle that
 case.
