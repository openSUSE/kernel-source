Subject: drm/i915: Fix S4 resume breakage
Patch-mainline: Submitted, suggested on ML
References: bsc#984629,bsc#984632,bsc#993472

We've seen S4 resume breakage on many Intel machines with SP2 kernel,
where typically the machine gets a memory corruption or kernel Oops /
panic.  This problem was seen even on the upstream kernel, and through
the bisection, it was pointed to be a side-effect of the commit:
  4c436d55b279bbc6b02aac02e7dc683fc09f884e
    drm/i915: Enable Resource Streamer state save/restore on MI_SET_CONTEXT

This patch fixes the regression by forcibly calling the GPU reset
at prerequiste of PM S4 restore, as was suggested by the i915
upstream dev.
