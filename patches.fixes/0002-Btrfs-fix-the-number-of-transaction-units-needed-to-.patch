Subject: [PATCH 2/2] Btrfs: fix the number of transaction units needed to
 remove a block group

We were using only 1 transaction unit when attempting to delete an unused
block group but in reality we need 3 + N units, where N corresponds to the
number of stripes. We were accounting only for the addition of the orphan
item (for the block group's free space cache inode) but we were not
accounting that we need to delete one block group item from the extent
tree, one free space item from the tree of tree roots and N device extent
items from the device tree.

While one unit is not enough, it worked most of the time because for each
single unit we are too pessimistic and assume an entire tree path, with
the highest possible heigth (8), needs to be COWed with eventual node
splits at every possible level in the tree, so there was usually enough
reserved space for removing all the items and adding the orphan item.

However after adding the orphan item, writepages() can by called by the VM
subsystem against the btree inode when we are under memory pressure, which
causes writeback to start for the nodes we COWed before, this forces the
operation to remove the free space item to COW again some (or all of) the
same nodes (in the tree of tree roots). Even without writepages() being
called, we could fail with ENOSPC because these items are located in
multiple trees and one of them might have a higher heigth and require
node/leaf splits at many levels, exhausting all the reserved space before
removing all the items and adding the orphan.

In the kernel 4.0 release, commit 3d84be799194 ("Btrfs: fix BUG_ON in
btrfs_orphan_add() when delete unused block group"), we attempted to fix
a BUG_ON due to ENOSPC when trying to add the orphan item by making the
cleaner kthread reserve one transaction unit before attempting to remove
the block group, but this was not enough. We had a couple user reports
still hitting the same BUG_ON after 4.0, like Stefan Priebe's report on
a 4.2-rc6 kernel for example:

    http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-btrfs/msg46070.html

So fix this by reserving all the necessary units of metadata.
