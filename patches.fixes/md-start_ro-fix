Subject: [PATCH] md: fix small irregularity with start_ro module parameter
Patch-mainline: 2.6.33
References: bnc#565219

The start_ro modules parameter can be used to force arrays to be
started in 'auto-readonly' in which they are read-only until the first
write.  This ensures that no resync/recovery happens until something
else writes to the device.  This is important for resume-from-disk
off an md array.

However if an array is started 'readonly' (by writing 'readonly' to
the 'array_state' sysfs attribute) we want it to be really 'readonly',
not 'auto-readonly'.

So strengthen the condition to only set auto-readonly if the
array is not already read-only.
