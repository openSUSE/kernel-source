Subject: [PATCH] NFSv4: When returning a delegation, don't reclaim an
 incompatible open mode.
Patch-mainline: not yet
References: bnc#934202

It is possible to have an active open with one mode, and a delegation
for the same file with a different mode.
In particular, a WR_ONLY open and an RD_ONLY delegation.

When returning the delegation, we currently try to claim opens for
every open type (n_rdwr, n_rdonly, n_wronly).  As there is no harm
in claiming an open for a mode that we already have, this is often
simplest.

However if the delegation only provides a subset of the modes that we
currently have open, this will produce an error from the server. e.g.

NFS: nfs4_handle_delegation_recall_error: unhandled error -13

So when claiming open modes prior to returning a delegation, skip the
open request if the mode is not covered by the delegation - the open_stateid
must already cover that mode, so there is nothing to do.
