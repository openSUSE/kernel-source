Subject: [PATCH] e1000e: don't inadvertently re-set INTX_DISABLE
Patch-mainline: v2.6.35, accepted into net-2.6
Git-commit: 36f2407fe52c55566221f8c68c8fb808abffd2f5 
References: bnc#610362

Should e1000_test_msi() fail to see an msi interrupt, it attempts to
fallback to legacy INTx interrupts. But an error in the code may prevent
this from happening correctly.

Before calling e1000_test_msi_interrupt(), e1000_test_msi() disables SERR
by clearing the SERR bit from the just read PCI_COMMAND bits as it writes
them back out.

Upon return from calling e1000_test_msi_interrupt(), it re-enables SERR
by writing out the version of PCI_COMMAND it had previously read.

The problem with this is that e1000_test_msi_interrupt() calls
pci_disable_msi(), which eventually ends up in pci_intx(). And because
pci_intx() was called with enable set to 1, the INTX_DISABLE bit gets
cleared from PCI_COMMAND, which is what we want. But when we get back to
e1000_test_msi(), the INTX_DISABLE bit gets inadvertently re-set because
of the attempt by e1000_test_msi() to re-enable SERR.

The solution is to have e1000_test_msi() re-read the PCI_COMMAND bits as
part of its attempt to re-enable SERR.

During debugging/testing of this issue I found that not all the systems
I ran on had the SERR bit set to begin with. And on some of the systems
the same could be said for the INTX_DISABLE bit. Needless to say these
latter systems didn't have a problem falling back to legacy INTx
interrupts with the code as is.
