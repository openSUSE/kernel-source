Subject: [PATCH] add migratepage address space op to shmem
Patch-mainline: 2.6.17-rc3
References: 176147

Basic problem: pages of a shared memory segment can only be migrated once.

In 2.6.16 through 2.6.17-rc1, shared memory mappings do not have a
migratepage address space op.  Therefore, migrate_pages() falls back to
default processing.  In this path, it will try to pageout() dirty pages.
Once a shared memory page has been migrated it becomes dirty, so
migrate_pages() will try to page it out.  However, because the page count
is 3 [cache + current + pte], pageout() will return PAGE_KEEP because
is_page_cache_freeable() returns false.  This will abort all subsequent
migrations.

This patch adds a migratepage address space op to shared memory segments to
avoid taking the default path.  We use the "migrate_page()" function
because it knows how to migrate dirty pages.  This allows shared memory
segment pages to migrate, subject to other conditions such as # pte's
referencing the page [page_mapcount(page)], when requested.

I think this is safe.  If we're migrating a shared memory page, then we
found the page via a page table, so it must be in memory.

Can be verified with memtoy and the shmem-mbind-test script, both
available at:  http://free.linux.hp.com/~lts/Tools/
