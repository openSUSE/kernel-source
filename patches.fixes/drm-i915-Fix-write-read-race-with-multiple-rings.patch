Subject: drm/i915: Fix write-read race with multiple rings
Git-commit: 02978ff57a5bdfbf703d2bc5a4d933a53ede3144
Patch-mainline: v3.11-rc2
References: bnc#830492

Daniel noticed a problem where is we wrote to an object with ring A in
the middle of a very long running batch, then executed a quick batch on
ring B before a batch that reads from the same object, its obj->ring would
now point to ring B, but its last_write_seqno would be still relative to
ring A. This would allow for the user to read from the object before the
GPU had completed the write, as set_domain would only check that ring B
had passed the last_write_seqno.

To fix this simply (and inelegantly), we bump the last_write_seqno when
switching rings so that the last_write_seqno is always relative to the
current obj->ring.

This fixes igt/tests/gem_write_read_ring_switch.
