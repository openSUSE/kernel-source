Subject: [PATCH] reiserfs: Remove 2 TB file size limit
References: bnc#592100
Patch-mainline: Submitted 30 Mar 2010

 In its early life, reiserfs had an evolving s_max_bytes. It started out
 at 4 GB, then was raised to MAX_LFS_FILESIZE, then dropped to 2 TiB when
 it was observed that struct stat only had a 32-bit st_blocks field.

 Since then, both the kernel and glibc have evolved as well and now both
 support 64-bit st_blocks. Applications that can't deal with these ranges
 are assumed to be "legacy" or "broken." File systems now routinely
 support file sizes much larger than can be represented by 2^32 * 512.

 But we never revisited that limitation. ReiserFS has always been able to
 support larger file sizes (up to 16 TiB, in fact), but the s_max_bytes
 limitation has prevented that.

 This patch adds a max_file_offset helper to set s_max_bytes to a more
 appropriate value. I noticed that XFS adjusts the limit based on the
 CPU but I'd prefer to err on the side of compatibility and place the
 limit at the smaller of the 32-bit MAX_LFS_FILESIZE and the maximum
 supported by the file system. At a 4k block size, this is conveniently
 also the advertised maximum file size of reiserfs.

 This bug is tracked at: https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=592100
