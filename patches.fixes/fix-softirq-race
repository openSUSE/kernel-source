Subject: Fix softirq race on bootup that triggers on emulators
Acked-by: ak@suse.de

It is possible to have tasklets get scheduled before softirqd has had
a chance to spawn on all CPUs.  This is totally harmless; after success
during action CPU_UP_PREPARE, action CPU_ONLINE will be called, which
immediately wakes softirqd on the appropriate CPU to process the already
pending tasklets.  So there is no danger of having a missed wakeup for
any tasklets that were already pending.

In particular, i386 is affected by this during startup, and is visible when
using a very large initrd; during the time it takes for the initrd to be
decompressed, a timer IRQ can come in and schedule RCU callbacks.  It is also
possible that resending of a hardware IRQ via a softirq triggers the same bug.

Because of different timing conditions, this shows up in all emulators
and virtual machines tested, including Xen, VMware, Virtual PC, and Qemu.
It is also possible to trigger on native hardware with a large enough initrd,
although I don't have a reliable case demonstrating that.
