Subject: [PATCH] Btrfs: send, don't leave without decrementing clone
 root's send_progress

If the clone root was not readonly or the dead flag was set on it, we were
leaving without decrementing the root's send_progress counter (and before
we just incremented it). If a concurrent snapshot deletion was in progress
and ended up being aborted, it would be impossible to later attempt to
delete again the snapshot, since the root's send_in_progress counter could
never go back to 0.

We were also setting clone_sources_to_rollback to i + 1 too early - if we
bailed out because the clone root we got is not readonly or flagged as dead
we ended up later derreferencing a null pointer because we didn't assign
the clone root to sctx->clone_roots[i].root:

		for (i = 0; sctx && i < clone_sources_to_rollback; i++)
			btrfs_root_dec_send_in_progress(
					sctx->clone_roots[i].root);

So just don't increment the send_in_progress counter if the root is readonly
or flagged as dead.
