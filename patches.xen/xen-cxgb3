From: http://xenbits.xen.org/XCP/linux-2.6.32.pq.hg?rev/20e4634f7b7b
Subject: apply xen specific patch to the Chelsio ethernet drivers
as a result of their feedback from the Cowly Beta
Patch-mainline: n/a

* Disable LRO by default. The kernel.org driver does enable it, but it 
does not play very well with the bridging layer. (Please note that the 
kernel.org driver does now implement GRO)

* Allocate SKBs instead of pages for incoming data. Using pages causes 
traffic to stall when the VMs use large MTUs.

* Disable lazy completion to Tx buffers. cxgb3 completion mechanism 
coalesces TX completion notifications, but this breaks the VM's 
behavior: The VMs networking stacks rely on skb to be freed in the 
hypervisor to open the Tx buffer.
